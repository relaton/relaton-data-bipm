abstract:
- content: "<p>Today it is often said that there is an over anxiety to initiate new
    scientific journals and this statement is probably only too true. Every member
    of the International Committee of Weights and Measures was very conscious of this
    potential criticism throughout the period when the Committee was giving consideration
    to the proposal that it sponsor an international journal devoted to scientific
    measurements of the highest precision and accuracy on which all experimental science
    rests. After much study the case for such a publication seemed overwhelming and
    Metrologia was launched. It is appropriate in this first number to state briefly
    the role and functions envisaged for Metrologia and the kind of material it will
    publish.</p><p>This journal will permit bringing together in one place, for convenience
    and accessibility, articles dealing with fundamental metrology. At present there
    is a wide dispersion of such articles in the journals of different countries.
    Even within a country the growing tendency towards specialist journals results
    in a further considerable dispersion of metrological publications on the basis
    of their field of physics.</p><p>Preference will be given to articles reporting
    the results of original researches that contribute to our progress in making fundamental
    scientific measurements. Currently this will comprise any work contributing to
    the improvement of accuracy and precision in measuring length, mass, time, electric
    current, temperature, luminance and ionizing radiations, and the accurate determination
    of physical constants involved in such measurements. Articles pertaining to a
    large number of different areas of physics will appear together but they will
    be unified by the fact that they will all be directed towards making the bases
    of measurement more accurate, reproducible and, if possible, more philosophically
    attractive. The subject spectrum will include interference, astronomy, photometry,
    gas thermometry, pyrometry, thermodynamics, radionuclides, neutrons, x-rays, and
    many other areas of physics, as well as such physical constants as the gyro-magnetic
    ratio of the proton, the acceleration due to gravity, the velocity of light, etc.
    Although principal emphasis will be placed on fundamental measurements, reports
    of experiments or techniques of particular originality and importance in the area
    of secondary measurement will be accepted, and certain secondary areas of measurement
    such as high frequency electrical measurement—where there are substantial difficulties
    in the way of attaining high accuracy, precision and international uniformity—will
    be of particular interest.</p><p>Review articles will be published in the same
    fields in order that both the specialist and the nonspecialist may have a convenient
    and readily available means of surveying the rapidly changing situation in fundamental
    metrology.</p><p>The journal will regularly inform its readers on the activities
    and decisions of the International Conference of Weights and Measures, the International
    Committee of Weights and Measures, and its Bureau at Sèvres, France, all of which
    operate under the oldest international scientific treaty—the Convention du Metre
    of 1875—which continues to assure uniform, precise and accurate measurements throughout
    the world. In this first number we are fortunate in having a comprehensive review
    article about this organization and its work prepared by Dr Jean Terrien, Director
    of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. This provides a background
    against which much that will be published later will fall into better perspective.</p><p>There
    will be a 'Letters to the Editor' section which it is hoped will offer a useful
    forum for presenting brief descriptions of original work, new possibilities for
    the improvement of scientific measurement, and particularly exchanges of opinions
    on the latter. Such a forum would have been invaluable during the years when the
    adoption of the new standard for the international metre was being actively considered
    and it may even yet be of service in the debates on the proposed transition to
    an atomic standard for defining interval and scale of time.</p><p>Ability to measure
    with ever increasing precision and accuracy is as much the foundation of science
    at is ever was, but during recent years the lack of reasonably convenient access
    through the scientific literature to comprehensive information on the current
    state of progress has undoubtedly blurred the picture to those not directly concerned
    and has been an inconvenience to those in the field. Assembly of this field of
    work into one journal should not only revive realization of the importance of
    improving the means of measurement but also underline the fact that to ensure
    the essential progress of science in the future fundamental metrology must continue
    to draw on the very latest developments of science and the most competent scientists.</p>"
