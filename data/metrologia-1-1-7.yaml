  content: "<p>The atomic hydrogen maser is described. In this device hydrogen atoms
    in the upper hyperfine state are focused onto the entrance aperture of a teflon
    coated quartz bulb in which the atoms are stored for about a second. This bulb
    is surrounded by a cylindrical radiofrequency cavity. When the cavity is tuned
    to the hyperfine frequency of atomic hydrogen, maser radiation is produced. Due
    to the large line <italic>Q</italic> resulting from the long storage time, the
    radiation is highly stable in frequency. Results are given of theoretical calculations
    on the threshold flux of atoms required for maser oscillations, on the various
    relaxation processes that limit the effective storage time, and on the possible
    sources of frequency shifts of the maser. Results are given on the relative stability
    of two hydrogen masers. Measurements of the atomic hyperfine frequency of atomic
    hydrogen and deuterium give Δ<sub>H</sub> = 1,420,405,751.800 ± 0.028 cps and
    Δ<sub>D</sub> = 327,384,352.5 ± 1.0 cps on the A.1 time scale with Δ<sub>Cs</sub>
    = 9,192,631,770.0 cps. The method by which the deuterium has been measured depends
    upon the effect of a deuterium magnetic resonance transition upon the intensity
    of the hydrogen maser oscillation amplitude when a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium
    is used. This method should be capable of extension to a number of different atoms.
    The hydrogen maser apparatus has been used to measure the spin exchange collision
    cross section between atomic hydrogen and a number of different gases. Results
    of some of these measurements are reported. Measurements of the dependence of
    the hydrogen hyperfine frequency upon a strong externally applied electrostatic
    field are given.</p>"
