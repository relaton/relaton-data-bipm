abstract:
- content: "<p>The atomic hydrogen maser is described. In this device hydrogen atoms
    in the upper hyperfine state are focused onto the entrance aperture of a teflon
    coated quartz bulb in which the atoms are stored for about a second. This bulb
    is surrounded by a cylindrical radiofrequency cavity. When the cavity is tuned
    to the hyperfine frequency of atomic hydrogen, maser radiation is produced. Due
    to the large line Q resulting from the long storage time, the radiation is highly
    stable in frequency. Results are given of theoretical calculations on the threshold
    flux of atoms required for maser oscillations, on the various relaxation processes
    that limit the effective storage time, and on the possible sources of frequency
    shifts of the maser. Results are given on the relative stability of two hydrogen
    masers. Measurements of the atomic hyperfine frequency of atomic hydrogen and
    deuterium give Δ<sub>H</sub> = 1,420,405,751.800 ± 0.028 cps and Δ<sub>D</sub>
    = 327,384,352.5 ± 1.0 cps on the A.1 time scale with Δ<sub>Cs</sub> = 9,192,631,770.0
    cps. The method by which the deuterium has been measured depends upon the effect
    of a deuterium magnetic resonance transition upon the intensity of the hydrogen
    maser oscillation amplitude when a mixture of hydrogen and deuterium is used.
    This method should be capable of extension to a number of different atoms. The
    hydrogen maser apparatus has been used to measure the spin exchange collision
    cross section between atomic hydrogen and a number of different gases. Results
    of some of these measurements are reported. Measurements of the dependence of
    the hydrogen hyperfine frequency upon a strong externally applied electrostatic
    field are given.</p>"
