abstract:
- content: "<p>A calculable standard of capacitance has been constructed in the form
    of a variable cylindrical cross-capacitor. The value defined by the standard is
    the change in capacitance due to the linear displacement of one screening electrode
    relative to another, and this displacement is measured in wavelengths of light
    (Hg green, Î» 5462) by means of a built-in Fabry-Perot interferometer.</p><p>The
    capacitance interval has a nominal maximum of 0.25 pF. The estimated accuracy
    of a capacitance determination by means of the standard is 1 in 10<sup>7</sup>
    when the value is expressed in e.s.u. The present uncertainty in the value assumed
    for the velocity of light limits the accuracy of a result expressed in e.m.u.
    to 1 in 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>"
