abstract:
- content: "<p>Pointing at first to the importance of gas thermometric measurements
    for securing the thermodynamic temperature scale a brief description is given
    of the three methods of constant volume, constant pressure and constant bulb-temperature,
    as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The author enters into the essential
    causes for systematic errors which should especially be considered in future measurements.
    Such errors are possible in the case of the indirect determination of fixedpoint-temperatures;
    because of the uncertainty of the expansion coefficient of the bulb material or
    of the second virial coefficient of the gases; or because of desorption effects.
    Recent gas thermometer results are compared with the results obtained by the optical
    method.</p>"
