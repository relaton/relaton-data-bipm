    <p>The experiment called in French "strioscopie" has been restudied. It is a particular case of diffrimoscopy, a field of optics which involves image formation by using only diffracted light.</p>
    <p>This introductory paper presents diffrimoscopy on the one hand as a tool for investigating the interaction of matter and light, and on the other hand as an image forming process that can be successfully applied to metrology.</p>
    <p>The profile of an object illuminated by a coherent beam, emits diffracted light which is focussed in a diffrimoscopic image. The main characteristics of such images are presented and illustrated by photographs. Their usefulness for metrology is brought out and the principle of the profiloscope briefly discussed. This instrument surpasses in performance the conventional profile projector.</p>
    <p>Attention is drawn to various characteristics of diffrimoscopic images which contribute fundamentally to the understanding of diffraction. A set of photographs shows a progressive transition from normal diffrimoscopy to ultramicroscopy.</p>
