abstract:
- content: <p>The experiment called in French "strioscopie" has been restudied. It
    is a particular case of diffrimoscopy, a field of optics which involves image
    formation by using only diffracted light.</p><p>This introductory paper presents
    diffrimoscopy on the one hand as a tool for investigating the interaction of matter
    and light, and on the other hand as an image forming process that can be successfully
    applied to metrology.</p><p>The profile of an object illuminated by a coherent
    beam, emits diffracted light which is focussed in a diffrimoscopic image. The
    main characteristics of such images are presented and illustrated by photographs.
    Their usefulness for metrology is brought out and the principle of the profiloscope
    briefly discussed. This instrument surpasses in performance the conventional profile
    projector.</p><p>Attention is drawn to various characteristics of diffrimoscopic
    images which contribute fundamentally to the understanding of diffraction. A set
    of photographs shows a progressive transition from normal diffrimoscopy to ultramicroscopy.</p>
