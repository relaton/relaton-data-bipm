abstract:
- content: "<p>The thermodynamic temperature scale was realized over the range from
    0 °C to -183 °C by using a helium constant volume gas thermometer, and platinum
    resistance thermometers were calibrated to derive an accurate relation between
    the resistance of pure platinum and the thermodynamic temperature. It is shown
    that the International Practical Scale of Temperature, as defined by the platinum
    resistance thermometer using the Callendar-Van Dusen equation, is in error by
    -0.036 °C at -80 °C and +0.023 °C at -150 °C, the estimated limit of error on
    these differences being ±0.006 °C.</p>"
