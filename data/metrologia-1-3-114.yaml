  content: "<p>In recognition of the October 1964 declaration of the International
    Committee of Weights and Measures that the physical measurement of time be based
    on a particular transition between two hyperfine levels in the ground state of
    cesium 133, a review of the characteristics of cesium beam atomic frequency standards
    is presented. This article discusses the general requirements for frequency and
    time standards, advantages offered by the atomic standard as compared to astronomical
    standards, various other atomic standards in brief, the operating principles of
    cesium standards, measures of performance, error sources in cesium standards,
    characteristics of several standards in current operation, comparison of cesium
    standards, and atomic time standards derived from atomic frequency standards.</p>"
