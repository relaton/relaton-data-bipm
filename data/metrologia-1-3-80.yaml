  content: "<p>A refractometer for the measurement of the refractive index of the
    surrounding air is described, in which interference fringes are produced between
    two beams, one propagated in air, the other in vacuum. The accuracy aimed at is
    one part in 10<sup>8</sup>, corresponding to the accuracy of the best vacuum wavelength
    standards used in the length measurement of mechanical standards. The refractometer
    is placed with the comparator inside an airtight isothermal enclosure and is operated
    from outside.</p>"
