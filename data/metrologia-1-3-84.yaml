abstract:
- content: "<p>The place of absolute measurements of gravity in the system of fundamental
    constants of physics and celestial mechanics is discussed and the history of absolute
    determinations is summarised. Two classes of method are mainly used at present,
    the reversible pendulum and the free-motion experiment. The principles of these
    methods are discussed in detail, particular attention being given to the definition
    of experimental parameters and to perturbing effects. The results so far obtained
    are described and experiments still in progress are mentioned. Three of the completed
    determinations are in Europe - at Leningrad (reversible pendulum), Teddington
    (reversible pendulum) and at SÃ¨vres (free-fall of line standard) and three are
    in N. America - at Washington (reversible pendulum), at Ottawa (free fall of graduated
    scale) and at Princeton (free fall of interferometer component). Comparisons between
    the results can only be made through measurements of the differences of gravity
    between the six sites and the problems of obtaining reliable differential results
    are indicated. It appears that the N. American results are more scattered than
    the European ones and that they differ from them by more than 2 mgal, an apparently
    significant amount. It is most likely that the differential measurements have
    systematic errors but there is a great need for further absolute measurements,
    especially in North America, to confirm or invalidate this conclusion.</p>"
