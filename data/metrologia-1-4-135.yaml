abstract:
- content: "<p>The technique of Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance thermometry is described.
    It is shown that the N.Q.R. thermometer exhibits unique properties of sensitivity,
    range, and reproducibility that are all desirable qualities for a temperature
    standard. The response to temperature is a unique characteristic of the working
    substance, which in this case is KClO<sub>3</sub>. Experimentally, the center
    frequency of the absorption line of Cl<sup>35</sup> in pure samples of KClO<sub>3</sub>
    at 77 °K is reproducible to approximately 2 Hz. This corresponds to an absolute
    accuracy of better than ± 0.001 °K. The purity of the samples is achieved by recrystallization
    of commercial reagents. The range of the thermometer extends from 10 °K to approximately
    450 °K. A description of a simple system which locks an oscillator to the N.Q.R.
    absorption line is given. A new method of determining accurately the frequency
    of the center of the line using magnetic field broadening is also described. With
    this technique a sensitivity of ± 0.0002 °K is expected. In line with these results,
    evaluation of a thermometer based on the temperature dependence of the nuclear
    magnetic resonance frequency in antiferromagnetic salts is made.</p>"
