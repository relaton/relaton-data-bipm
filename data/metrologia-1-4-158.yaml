  content: <p>The various aspects of the concept of temperature as a basic quantity
    in physics are discussed. After a brief historical introduction, the thermodynamic
    basis of the definition of temperature is given. In ยง 3 the statistical definition
    of temperature in terms of the canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics is
    presented and the equivalence with the thermodynamic definition is stressed. Attention
    is given also to the physical meaning of negative temperatures. In ยง 4 the realization
    of the thermodynamic temperature scale based on the laws of ideal gases, ideal
    paramagnetic and nuclear magnetic substances and black body radiation is discussed.
    The international practical temperature scale is very briefly discussed in ยง 5.
    Finally in ยง 6 some remarks are made about the "basic" character of temperature
    concept and it is stressed that proposals to change the definition of this quantity
    have so far not offered an improvement.</p>
