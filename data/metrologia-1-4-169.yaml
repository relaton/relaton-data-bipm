abstract:
- content: "<p>A definition of time-scales and criteria of uniformity of a time-scale
    are introduced in the first part of the paper. These considerations are applied
    to time-scales currently used in Astronomy: Sidereal and Universal Times. Each
    of them is defined, their equivalence is proved, and the precision with which
    each can be determined is discussed. The irregularities of the rotation of the
    Earth are the causes of the non-uniformity of these time-scales. A uniform gravitational
    time, Ephemeris Time, is then defined and the precision of its determination is
    discussed. All the three astronomical time-scales have a necessity of their own
    and cannot be interchanged. In order to reach a better understanding of the concept
    of time, it is necessary that all time-scales — including atomic time — should
    coexist and be compared with the highest possible precision.</p>"
