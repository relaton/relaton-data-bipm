  content: "<p>A 159.2 Hz power supply with 85 VA power output and very stable amplitude
    was designed and constructed for use in an absolute volt experiment. The rms value
    of the ac voltage is regulated at the level of a dc reference voltage (based on
    unsaturated standard cells), using a feedback control circuit. The measured amplitude
    drift is less than 0.5 ppm/h and is typically less than 1 ppm in 4 h. The measured
    amplitude temperature coefficient is 0.6 ppm/Â°C and the distortion is less than
    0.02%.</p>"
