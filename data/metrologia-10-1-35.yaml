abstract:
- content: "<p>The most favourable pH value of the electrolyte of the International
    Weston cell has proved to be pH = 1.4 ± 0.2 which guarantees an emf having a drift
    of only about ±0.2μV/year when all precautions are taken in the manufacture of
    the cells. NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> ions influence the pH value of the electrolyte
    and should therefore be avoided in the cells.</p>"
