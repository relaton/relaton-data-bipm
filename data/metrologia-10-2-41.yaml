abstract:
- content: "<p>A method permitting to combine in a single instrument the main methodical
    and technical achievements of precise gas thermometry is described. This method
    gives the possibility to determine thermodynamic temperature uniformly using directly
    as a reference point only the triple point of water over the whole range in which
    gas can be used as a thermometric substance. The major data on the theory, parameters
    and the schematic diagram of a new gas thermometer having two working bulbs which
    operate at reference and unknown temperatures respectively, are given. The practical
    realization of the method is illustrated by the results of new measurements at
    the boiling point of oxygen.</p>"
