  content: "<p>The spectral irradiances of three 400 W metal halide lamps were measured
    on two different spectrophotometers. The first system had a grating monochromator
    with reciprocal linear dispersion of 0.8 nm/mm and the second a double monochromator
    with quartz prisms. The latter instrument had a reciprocal linear dispersion of
    approximately 24 nm/mm at 560 nm. The measurements were made in the wavelength
    region 300 to 830 nm. The results obtained from the two instruments are compared
    and discussed. Chromaticities, correlated color temperatures and color rendering
    indices were calculated. Chromaticities were also measured on a mask photometer.
    The spectral distributions of the lamps obtained from the results of measurements
    on the grating instrument yielded a more realistic picture of the lamp spectra
    than those obtained from measurements made on the prism instruments. Measurements
    at 5 nm intervals on the prism instrument yielded derived results, e.g. chromaticities
    and correlated color temperatures, in fair agreement with those obtained with
    the grating instrument only if great care was taken in selection of slitwidths.</p>"
