  content: "<p>The results of the activity measurement of a 1 Ci <sup>60</sup>Co source
    made at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures are compared to those of
    the power measurement of a similar <sup>60</sup>Co source performed at the National
    Bureau of Standards. For this comparison, the ratio of the activities of the two
    sources is determined; the method used is described and the errors analysed. The
    agreement between the activity and power measurements is excellent: the relative
    difference is less than 1 Ã— 10<sup>-3</sup>, which is not significant according
    to the estimated errors.</p>"
