abstract:
- content: "<p>The method of generating the NRC atomic time scales UTC(NRC) and AT(NRC)
    is outlined, and estimates of their uniformity are derived from intercomparisons
    of the NRC primary standard, Cs III, and the group of atomic clocks maintained
    at NRC. Comparisons between UTC(NRC) and other national scales through reception
    of television and Loran C signals are outlined, and it is shown that conflicting
    results arise from these two methods. In addition, the uniformity of UTC(NRC)
    deduced from these comparisons appears to be significantly worse than that determined
    from internal clock comparisons. Variation in signal propagation delay for both
    TV and Loran C transmissions is proposed as a possible explanation both for the
    disagreement between TV and Loran C time scale comparisons and for the apparent
    degradation in the uniformity of UTC(NRC).</p>"
