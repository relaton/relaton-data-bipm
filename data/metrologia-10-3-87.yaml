abstract:
- content: "<p>It is shown that the Ramsey resonance curves for most atomic beam machines
    can be conceived as depending on two distributions of velocity, ρ(V) and ξ(V),
    the second being a correction for beam width.</p><p>An analysis and computer program
    are described which permit one to obtain ρ, ξ and the nominal microwave power
    parameter from three or more measured Ramsey resonance curves at properly spaced
    power levels whose ratios are known. The determination from the functions (ρ,
    ξ) of bias errors due to second order Doppler shift, cavity phase difference,
    and cavity pulling is described.</p><p>The method may also be used to improve
    an experimentally obtained velocity distribution (i.e., one obtained through the
    pulse technique); to provide the proper function ξ; and to provide diagnostic
    checks of the measurement technique and the validity of the model chosen for the
    transition probability.</p><p>The method is applied to the NBS frequency standard.
    Error estimates indicate that it is feasible by microwave power shift measurements
    to evaluate the total bias error due to the above sources to within one part in
    10<sup>13</sup>.</p>"
