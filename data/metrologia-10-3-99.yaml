abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method for measuring the activity of strong<sup>60</sup>Co sources
    is described. It is based on the precise experimental determination by gamma spectrometry
    of the activity ratio for two sources which are very different in strength but
    of identical geometry. After dissolution of the weak source its activity is measured
    by the absolute 4π β-γ coincidence method. The activity of the strong source is
    obtained from the activity ratio and the activity of the weak source. In this
    way, a 1 Ci<sup>60</sup>Co source has been compared with a 2 mCi source. The activity
    of the 1 Ci source is determined with an accuracy of about 0.2%.</p>"
