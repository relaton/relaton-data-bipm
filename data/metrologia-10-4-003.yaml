abstract:
- content: "<p>The D<sub>2</sub>O content of heavy water has been determined by mass
    spectrometric analysis of deuterium gas samples which had been brought into equilibrium
    with samples of the water.</p><p>By careful sample handling and preparation, application
    of corrections and a calibration procedure the accuracy of the results was improved
    to Â± 0.001 mole% D<sub>2</sub>O for reactor grade heavy water.</p>"
