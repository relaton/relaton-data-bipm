abstract:
- content: <p>This paper describes apparatus which has been constructed for the calibration
    of stylus surface roughness measuring equipment by using a "simulated surface"
    generated by a vibration table. A differential capacitance position senser attached
    to the table is in a servo loop with the electro-magnetic table drive. This arrangement
    allows the table to be driven to follow faithfully periodic and random signals
    over a wide range of amplitudes and frequencies and enables the static and dynamic
    calibration of surface roughness equipment. Accurately known displacements ranging
    from less than 10 nm to 4000 nm are obtainable and the frequency span is from
    dc to 800 Hz (3 dB). The calibration of the simulator remains stable within 0.5%
    for periods of more than 6 months.</p>
