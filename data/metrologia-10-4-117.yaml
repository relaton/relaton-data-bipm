abstract:
- content: "<p>NBS has measured the densities of four single crystal silicon objects
    to a standard deviation of 0.26 ppm with a systematic error of 0.7 ppm. These
    objects will be used as working standards to which density work in the United
    States will be referred. A redundant hydrostatic comparison test involving two
    standards at a time has been devised, the use of which facilitates the efficient
    propagation of the density information contained in these crystals into other
    objects which may be used as standards by other laboratories. This article describes
    a method of employing this redundant comparison procedure.</p>"
