  content: "<p>The principles for designing a calibration scheme for a set of mass
    standards are discussed. On these principles, a particular scheme has been chosen
    as being convenient and reasonably efficient; it is pointed out that although
    it has not been possible to decide whether the selected scheme is optimum, it
    can be said that it is more efficient than most. In an actual calibration based
    on this scheme, the accuracy decreased from 1.5 in 10<sup>7</sup>, to which the
    Materials Research Laboratories 1 kg standard is known, to 1.6 in 10<sup>8</sup>
    for the 1 g mass; such a decrease in accuracy is shown to be a property of all
    such schemes.</p>"
