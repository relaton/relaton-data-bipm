    <p>The D<sub>2</sub>O content of heavy water has been determined by mass spectrometric analysis of deuterium gas samples which had been brought into equilibrium with samples of the water.</p>
    <p>By careful sample handling and preparation, application of corrections and a calibration procedure the accuracy of the results was improved to Â± 0.001 mole% D<sub>2</sub>O for reactor grade heavy water.</p>
