abstract:
- content: "<p>A new type of thermal cycling effect, apparently not related to strains,
    has been found in Pt resistance thermometers that contain some oxygen in their
    gas filling – a category that probably fits a majority of existing standard thermometers.
    The resistance changes associated with this effect have been investigated in twelve
    different thermometers and shown to be reversible in nature. Conclusive evidence
    that the effect is linked to an O<sub>2</sub> – Pt sensor interaction was obtained
    by controlled experiments. This interaction cannot only affect the reproducibility
    of a thermometer, but it also leads to ambiguity in the resistance ratio (W(t))
    used to define temperature on the International Practical Temperature Scale. The
    resulting uncertainty in temperature measurement is estimated to be as large as
    7 mK near 630° C, depending on thermometer characteristics, calibration and measuring
    procedures, etc.; but will tend to become much smaller as the temperature decreases.
    Specific proposals are outlined for reducing the influence of these O<sub>2</sub>
    – activated cycling effects on temperature measurements.</p>"
