abstract:
- content: "<p>A technique was devised for wavelength comparison with respect to the<sup>86</sup>Kr
    standard. The apparatus used is described; it consists of an evacuated Fabry-Pérot
    interferometer with photoelectric detection. The essential feature is provision
    for scanning the projected interference pattern by a uniform rotation of a mirror.
    Sources of uncertainty are discussed. Vacuum wavelength values are given for the<sup>86</sup>Kr
    secondary standards which are compared with other recent measurements. The wavelengths
    obtained agree with the adopted values within the allowable tolerances. Furthermore
    a first series of measurements of the wavelengths of two helium-neon lasers stabilized
    on the Lamb dip are reported.</p>"
