    <p>Simple modifications made to a precise double-pan balance achieved single-pan operation with the knives under constant load throughout the procedure of interchanging the masses. A twenty-fold increase in accuracy resulted, approaching that of the best balances yet constructed. Moreover, by providing the balance with electromagnetic feedback, a damped motion and a digital display of the mass discrepancy were achieved which resulted in much more convenience in use.</p>
    <p>Illustrative results from comparisons between the UK primary standard of the pound and authorized copy pound No. 5 to an accuracy approaching one microgram (2 parts in 10<sup>9</sup>) are given.</p>
