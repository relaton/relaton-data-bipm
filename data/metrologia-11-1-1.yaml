abstract:
- content: "<p>Simple modifications made to a precise double-pan balance achieved
    single-pan operation with the knives under constant load throughout the procedure
    of interchanging the masses. A twenty-fold increase in accuracy resulted, approaching
    that of the best balances yet constructed. Moreover, by providing the balance
    with electromagnetic feedback, a damped motion and a digital display of the mass
    discrepancy were achieved which resulted in much more convenience in use.</p><p>Illustrative
    results from comparisons between the UK primary standard of the pound and authorized
    copy pound No. 5 to an accuracy approaching one microgram (2 parts in 10<sup>9</sup>)
    are given.</p>"
