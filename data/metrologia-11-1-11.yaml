abstract:
- content: "<p>The exposure rate computed from calorimeter power measurements is compared
    to the exposure rate of the same source (1-Ci cobalt-60) determined by means of
    a graphite cavity ionization chamber. A difference of 0.38% was found and is not
    considered significant compared to the estimated systematic uncertainty (1.3%)</p>"
