abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparisons for<sup>60</sup>Co gamma rays between the exposure standards
    of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), the National Bureau of
    Standards (NBS) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) are reported.
    For measurements made at about one meter from the source, and if the same physical
    constants are used, the differences are 0.26% between the BIPM and NBS standards,
    and at most 0.4% between the BIPM standard and the PTB standard chambers. The
    differences are consistent with the estimated systematic uncertainties (≈0.5%).</p><p>The
    difference between the NBS standard and the PTB chamber measurements, as determined
    through the ratios of each to the BIPM chamber, ranges from 0.17 to 0.66%. The
    difference in exposure standards for NBS and PTB actually ranges from 0.48 to
    0.97%, since different stopping power corrections are used by these two laboratories.</p><p>An
    indirect comparison of the BIPM and NBS standards indicates that the difference
    of 0.26% will increase to 0.55% at a distance of two meters.</p>"
