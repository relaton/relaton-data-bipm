  content: "<p>A technique was devised for wavelength comparison with respect to the
    <sup>86</sup>Kr standard. The apparatus used is described; it consists of an evacuated
    Fabry-Pérot interferometer with photoelectric detection. The essential feature
    is provision for scanning the projected interference pattern by a uniform rotation
    of a mirror. Sources of uncertainty are discussed. Vacuum wavelength values are
    given for the <sup>86</sup>Kr secondary standards which are compared with other
    recent measurements. The wavelengths obtained agree with the adopted values within
    the allowable tolerances. Furthermore a first series of measurements of the wavelengths
    of two helium-neon lasers stabilized on the Lamb dip are reported.</p>"
