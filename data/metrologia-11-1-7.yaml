abstract:
- content: "<p>The electrical output of most direct-reading photoelectric microscopes
    is a non-linear function of the offset of the line from the fiducial position.
    In an earlier paper (1971 Metrologia 7, 135–142) the author proposed the use of
    a triangular scanning waveform to overcome this defect. In this paper, two other
    methods of linearization are developed. One method gives exact linearization for
    certain types of microscope, but not for the NSL instrument. The second method
    was developed empirically by Koulicovitch but is here analyzed mathematically
    in more detail. It is shown that very satisfactory approximations to linearity
    can be obtained by this method, even for the NSL microscope, which presents a
    more difficult problem because of its dependence on the width of the line being
    scanned. Departures from linearity of less than 0.02 μm over a range of 5 μm can
    be achieved without loss of sensitivity. An additional benefit is the almost complete
    elimination of the variation of sensitivity with line width.</p>"
