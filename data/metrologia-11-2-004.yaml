abstract:
- content: "<p>A method of data collection for the determination of absolute disintegration
    rates by the 4 πβ - γ coincidence technique is described, which gives nearly an
    order of magnitude smaller variance, for a given total counting time, than conventional
    methods. It is applicable when the β counter output is proportional to the β particle
    energy. The principle, which is demonstrated for<sup>134</sup>Cs, is to record
    the amplitudes of all the β pulses, followed by integration over variable limits.
    Expressions for dead time and resolving time corrections are derived.</p>"
