  content: "<p>After a short review on the different attenuation measuring techniques,
    some special points of view in the application of the power method are described.
    By employing exactly measured standard attenuators in cascade, the modified measuring
    equipment can be used over a range of more than 100 dB. An error analysis is given
    considering all essential sources of systematical errors the limits of which are
    calculated. It is shown that the systematical error of the system described is
    less than 1 · 10<sup>-4</sup> dB for very small attenuation values. It is in the
    order of |δ<italic>A</italic>| ≈ 1 · 10<sup>-4</sup> (1 + <italic>A</italic>)
    dB over the whole range, when <italic>A</italic> is the numerical value of the
    attenuation (in dB) being measured.</p>"
