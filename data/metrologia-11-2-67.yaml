  content: "<p>As an extension of the 4 πβ - γ coincidence technique, it is shown
    that for some radionuclides, the β count rate should be expressed as a function
    of at least two observed β efficiencies, and that the absolute disintegration
    rate can be obtained by a simultaneous extrapolation to 100% efficiency in the
    two or more dimensions. Measurements on <sup>57</sup>Co and <sup>134</sup>Cs are
    described as examples. For these nuclides, the separated efficiency functions
    are shown to be linear in theory as well as in practice. Thus a major source of
    systematic uncertainty in efficiency extrapolation, that due to the unknown form
    of the extrapolation function, is greatly reduced.</p>"
