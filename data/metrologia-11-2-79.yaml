abstract:
- content: "<p>The establishment of the NPL viscosity scale using glass capillary
    viscometers is described and the values obtained for NPL viscometers on subsequent
    recalibrations over a period of some years are given. The results of comparisons
    with independent viscosity scales in other countries are also tabulated.</p><p>From
    the results obtained on recalibration of the NPL viscometers and the comparisons
    made with other independent laboratories, it is concluded that the present scale
    is realized with an uncertainty of about 0.2% at low viscosities (5 cSt) rising
    to about 0.5% at high viscosities (5000 cSt).</p>"
