abstract:
- content: "<p>A new measurement of the thermodynamic temperature interval between
    the silver and the gold freezing points with an infrared pyrometer has been carried
    out. The value of the freezing point of gold, referred to the value of the silver
    point on the IPTS-68, thus obtained, is 1337.41 K (σ = 0.059 K). The ratio of
    the spectral radiances at the two points is 2.4428 (σ = 1.2 · 10<sup>-3</sup>)
    at the mean effective wavelength λ<sub>e</sub> = 0.9980μm (σ= 0.3 nm). The resulting
    temperature interval is 0.17 K shorter than the IPTS-68 interval between the same
    points.</p>"
