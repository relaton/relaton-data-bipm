  content: "<p>This paper compares measurements of the wavelength of an NPL constructed
    iodine stabilized laser, made in terms of the <sup>86</sup>Kr primary standard
    which were carried out at the BIPM, with an earlier measurement at NPL. The result
    of the BIPM measurements for the i component of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> is
    λ (<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>, i) = [632991 399.7 ± 0.2] fm and differs by only
    0.7 fm (1 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) from the NPL result made on the same laser. The results
    provide an illustration of the reproducibility of the <sup>86</sup>Kr standard
    which is now considered to be of the order of 4 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, and also illustrate
    the ability of the two laboratories with their different measurement techniques
    to perform high precision wavelength measurement. Some preliminary beat frequency
    measurements of the frequency reproducibility of BIPM and NPL lasers are also
    reported.</p>"
