  content: "<p>A new NML scale of spectral irradiance has been realized for the wavelength
    range 350-800 nm. The first step was to calibrate as a standard of relative spectral
    radiance a cavity radiator made from tungsten foil and operated at about 2600
    K. Filter radiometry was used for this purpose, instead of the more conventional
    procedure based on optical pyrometry. Tungsten-filament lamps were then calibrated
    as standards of relative spectral irradiance by comparison with the cavity radiator,
    and finally these calibrations were made absolute using electrically calibrated
    radiometers.</p>"
