abstract:
- content: "<p>A description is given of the experimental procedures used to transfer
    the photometric scales of the National Measurement Laboratory to a radiometric
    base. Tungsten halogen lamps and gas-filled tungsten-filament lamps, operated
    at the distribution temperature 2856 K, are calibrated as standards of illuminance
    by using an electrically calibrated radiometer to measure the irradiance when
    a filter simulating the V (Î») function is interposed between the lamp and radiometer.
    A value of 682 lm W<sup>-1</sup> has been adopted for K<sub>m</sub>, the maximum
    spectral luminous efficiency of radiation, because the measurements have shown
    that this value gives continuity with the Laboratory's previous scale of luminous
    intensity. It is expected that the photometric base unit will eventually be redefined
    so as to provide an exactly known, internationally agreed value for K<sub>m</sub>.</p>"
