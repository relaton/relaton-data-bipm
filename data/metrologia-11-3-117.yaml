  content: "<p>The resistance ratios of platinum resistance thermometers from different
    manufacturers are compared at many temperatures below 375 K. These resistance
    ratios can be interrelated by a function with six coefficients determined from
    the defining fixed point calibrations by the method of least squares. We suggest
    that this single function could replace the four deviation functions of the IPTS-68.
    Non-uniqueness in the temperature scale resulting from the imperfections both
    of this new, and of the IPTS-68 deviation functions are discussed. An even simpler
    deviation function is used to calibrate thermometers in the range 90 to 273 K.
    Moderately precise secondary calibrations are obtained over the whole temperature
    range using this simpler function together with comparisons with a calibrated
    thermometer at only four temperatures. We show one way of smoothing the reference
    function of the IPTS-68 to make it more nearly resemble a real thermometer. The
    new six-coefficient function is then used to relate all thermometers to this smoothed
    reference function.</p>"
