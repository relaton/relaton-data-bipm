  content: "<p>The freezing point of silver is being considered as a joining point
    between platinum resistance thermometry and optical pyrometry. Therefore the freezing
    points of high purity samples of silver have been investigated. An important impurity
    effect arises from the depression of the freezing point of pure Ag caused by residual
    dissolved oxygen contents in some samples. Melting range parameters were determined
    on both oxided and carefully deoxided samples to aid in the selection of the purest
    sample. In addition the presence of dissolved oxygen is indicated by a slope inversion
    on the melting curve. Evaluations of the freezing point depression for small oxygen
    contents are given. A graphite sample crucible, with graphite radiation and gettering
    dises interspersed in the thermal insulation of the thermometer well, is a convenient
    arrangement to prevent the contamination of the sample in the presence of traces
    of oxygen, but is not sufficient for purifying heavily oxided samples; such samples
    require a vacuum treatment at about 1050Â° C. The pressure effect on the freezing
    temperature of silver has been determined.</p>"
