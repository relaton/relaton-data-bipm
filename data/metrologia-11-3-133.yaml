abstract:
- content: "<p>The accuracy of the rate or frequency of an atomic time scale is the
    degree to which its unit agrees with the SI second. Primary frequency standards
    are constructed in such a manner that they provide the most accurate possible
    physical realization of the SI second. These standards are then used to calibrate
    or construct an atomic time scale which may also be used as a stable reference
    standard.</p><p>Mathematical models characterizing the performance of both the
    primary frequency standards and reference standards are developed, and based on
    these models a current best estimate of the SI second is derived utilizing current
    and previous calibrations.</p><p>The modeling techniques and theory are applied
    to the NBS primary frequency standards and atomic time scale system and a significant
    improvement is realized in the accuracy of the frequency estimate so derived.
    We estimate that the second used by the Bureau International de l'Heure in generating
    TAI and UTC was too short by about 9 Â± 2 parts in 10<sup>13</sup> during the fall
    of 1974.</p>"
