abstract:
- content: "<p>It is proposed (1) that the basic photometric unit be redefined so
    as to provide an exact numerical relationship between it and the SI unit of power,
    the watt, for a specified monochromatic radiation; and (2) that the unit of luminous
    intensity, the candela, be replaced as the basic unit by the unit of luminous
    flux, the lumen. It is claimed that the existing definitions are predominantly
    the product of early photometric practices that have been superseded. A closer
    link between photometry and spectroradiometry is now desirable. The proposals
    would enable photometric values to be derived from spectroradiometric data by
    exact computation, and would remove the need for a primary standard of light.
    They would not alter significantly the present magnitudes of the photometric units,
    nor change the existing relationship between photometry and visual perception.
    Because the proposed redefinitions are in terms of monochromatic rather than complex
    radiation, however, they would provide a more convenient basis for the future
    adoption of new spectral weighting procedures.</p>"
