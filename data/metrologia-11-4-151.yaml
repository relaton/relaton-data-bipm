abstract:
- content: "<p>A switching-type noise thermometer is used for the determination of
    the ratio of thermodynamic temperatures of two resistances, one having a value
    of 10 kΩ and maintained at a temperature in the range 90 to 100 K and the other,
    regarded as the reference, of 3 kΩ maintained slightly above room temperature
    (298 K).</p><p>The various instrumental errors are analysed and it is shown that
    operation with the instrument simultaneously balanced in two different frequency
    ranges results in the automatic elimination of some of these, allowing a precision
    of 1 in 10<sup>5</sup>, equivalent to 1 mK at 100 K, to be approached, subject
    to the requirement of lengthy averaging for the reduction of statistical uncertainty.</p><p>Preliminary
    results, based on the assumption of negligible difference between the IPTS-68
    and the thermodynamic scale at the reference temperature, show the difference
    T - T<sub>68</sub> to be + 3 mK at 90.17 K and + 8 mK at 97 K. The standard deviations
    of these differences are 3 mK and 4 mK respectively.</p><p>Recent gas thermometry
    at NBS indicates that the IPTS-68 temperature may be significantly higher than
    the corresponding thermodynamic one at the reference temperature and if this is
    taken into account the noise thermometer result is in close numerical agreement
    with the IPTS-68 value for the oxygen boiling point.</p>"
