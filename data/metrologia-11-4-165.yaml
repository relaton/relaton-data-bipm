abstract:
- content: <p>An experimental determination of the maximum spectral luminous efficacy
    of radiation has been made. The method uses luminous intensity standard lamps
    calibrated in "World mean candela 1952", thermopiles calibrated by absolute radiometers
    of electrical substitution type and filters of which the spectral transmittance
    is approximately proportional to the relative spectral luminous efficiency. An
    average value of 683 lm/W has been obtained, and the result is compared with that
    obtained at the NPL.</p>
