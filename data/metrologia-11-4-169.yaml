  content: "<p>For all measurements the problem of error estimation is very important.
    At time there exists an arbitrariness selecting a sultable error criterion for
    measured values and measuring devices. This arbitrariness is removed by means
    of the modern information theory. Thereby the law of the a priori distribution
    is of high importance. As the result of stipulated considerations two distribution
    laws are derived for constrained and unconstrained test data from which the mean
    information-error of a measuring device can be computed.</p>"
