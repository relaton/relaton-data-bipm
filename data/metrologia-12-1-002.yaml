abstract:
- content: "<p>An automatic tuning circuit for correcting the resonant frequency of
    the cavities used in a pair of hydrogen masers is described, with particular emphasis
    on measurements of the relative frequency stability obtained using the system.
    The measurements show that improved long-term stability of the two NRC masers
    can be obtained by the use of the auto-tuner. The stability of the measured frequency
    difference between the masers is now typically 1.5 parts in 10<sup>14</sup> over
    periods up to one week. Correlation has been found between changes in the frequency
    corrections supplied by the auto-tuner and changes in atmospheric pressure, indicating
    that the cavity frequency of each maser is sensitive to pressure changes. The
    magnitude of this effect and modifications made to the masers to reduce it, are
    discussed.</p>"
