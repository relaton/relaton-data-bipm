  content: "<p>The low frequency (30 Hz) paramagnetic susceptibilities of powdered
    samples of gadolinium sulphate octahydrate and manganous ammonium sulphate hexahydrate
    have been measured from 1 to 83 K in order to test the thermodynamic consistency
    of the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68). The data can
    be characterized by a physically based expression with essentially two constants
    as opposed to the twenty-one terms of the IPTS-68 Reference Function for the range
    13.81 K to 273.15 K. Variations in the IPTS-68 of up to ± 3 mK about the smooth
    magnetic scale are found and the 20.28 K (e-H<sub>2</sub> b.p.) fixed point is
    shown to be inconsistent with the other fixed points by about +3 mK. The data
    also provide a means of thermodynamically extrapolating the IPTS-68 to lower temperatures
    where comparisons are made with other recent data. The reproducibility of the
    data is ± 0.5 mK below 50 K and ± 1 mK up to 83 K, while the total estimated measurement
    uncertainties are from one to three times greater.</p>"
