    <p>The scale presented in this document was proposed by the
    International Committee of Weights and Measures in 1974
    and adopted by the 15th General Conference of Weights
    and Measures in 1975. It constitutes only an amendment
    of the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968
    (IPTS-68), not a replacement. Any measured temperature,
    T68, remains unchanged by this amendment of the
    IPTS-68.</p>
