abstract:
- content: "<p>A cryogenic ac Josephson effect emf standard has been developed in
    which all precise measurements are carried out in a superfluid helium bath. This
    standard uses a superconducting current comparator having a ratio accuracy of
    better than 1 in 10<sup>9</sup> for the calibration of a resistive potential divider.
    The cryogenic emf standard has a precision of 1.1 in 10<sup>8</sup> and corroborates
    the results obtained from an ac Josephson effect standard using conventional room
    temperature techniques.</p>"
