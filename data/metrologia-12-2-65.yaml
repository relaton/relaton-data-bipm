  content: "<p>Measurements of some mass attenuation coefficients for 1.33 MeV γ radiation
    of <sup>60</sup>Co have been performed in excellent narrow beam collimated geometry.
    The mass attenuation coefficient of aluminum was determined from the experimental
    transmission curve with a good accuracy (less than 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) and the
    value obtained was then used as a reference for other elements or compounds: copper,
    silicon, organic compounds. The mass attenuation coefficient of chlorine is deduced
    from that of organic compounds made of carbon and chlorine. The sources of error
    have been investigated. A study of the influence of pile-up effects on attenuation
    measurements is reported and a method for correcting these effects is proposed.
    The results obtained: (μ/ρ)<sub>Al</sub> = (0.053 13 ± 0.000 10) cm<sup>2</sup>
    g<sup>-1</sup>, (μ/ρ)<sub>Cu</sub> = (0.050 80 ± 0.000 10) cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>,
    (μ/ρ)<sub>Si</sub> = (0.055 23 ± 0.000 11) cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and (μ/ρ)<sub>Cl</sub>
    = (0.052 91 ± 0.000 18) cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, are in good agreement with
    the values tabulated at NBS (about 1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). A comparison is made
    with other experimental results.</p>"
