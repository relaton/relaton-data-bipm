abstract:
- content: "<p>Anti-coincidence counting is examined as an alternative to conventional
    coincidence methods for radioactive source strength measurement. Live-timing principles
    are combined with the use, for all channels, of a shared dead-time of the extending
    type. Accuracy, precision, decay and background effects are treated and results
    of comparisons with coincidence measurements given which show agreement consistent
    with statistical uncertainties of about 0.03%.</p>"
