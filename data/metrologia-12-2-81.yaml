  content: "<p>Using the results of recent experimental determinations of several
    different fundamental physical constants, highly accurate, indirect values for
    the ratio of the as-maintained ampere to absolute ampere may be obtained. A comparison
    of these indirect values with the results of direct determinations based on force
    balances and with the presently accepted best value indicates that both of the
    latter may be in error.</p>"
