abstract:
- content: "<p>The boiling and triple points of oxygen have been realized with absolute
    uncertainties (at the 67% confidence level) estimated at 0.1 mK in both cases.
    The work completes the implementation at NPL of the International Practical Temperature
    Scale of 1968.</p><p>Sources of error are examined in detail, with particular
    attention paid to the effects of impurities. Although these have been studied
    experimentally, the results are believed to have been perturbed by persistent
    sample inhomogeneities.</p>"
