  content: "<p>A new manometer to measure gas pressures between vacuum and one atmosphere
    has been developed and is capable of easily tracking a continuously changing pressure
    at rates up to 600 Pa/s. It consists of a U-tube manometer in which the mercury
    surfaces are the reflectors of a Michelson interferometer. The difference in heights
    of the mercury surfaces is detected and measured by use of laser interferometry
    techniques with a He-Ne laser. The manometer is sensitive to changes in pressure
    of less than 40 mPa, but the ultimate accuracy of 180 mPa at a pressure of 101
    kPa (2 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>) is limited by the temperature uniformity and stability
    (10 mK).</p>"
