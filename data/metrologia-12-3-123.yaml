  content: "<p>An intercomparison among the spectral irradiance scales of eight national
    standardizing laboratories has been carried out by the Electrotechnical Laboratory
    of Japan. Four tungsten-filament, quartz-bromine lamps with clear of frosted bulbs
    were distributed to each of the participants. The values of spectral irradiance,
    produced by the lamps at a specified point were measured at seven wavelengths
    from 300 to 800 nm. The comparison shows that most of the laboratories agreed
    within Â±1%, except for the wavelengths of 300, 350 and 800 nm. It is suggested
    that further study is necessary at those wavelengths.</p>"
