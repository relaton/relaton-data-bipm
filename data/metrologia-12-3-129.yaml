  content: "<p>Since May 1, 1975, the NRC primary cesium beam frequency standard,
    CsV, has operated as a primary clock, generating directly a new time scale, PT(NRC
    CsV). Steps in the development of CsV from a frequency standard to a clock, and
    new error evaluations using the two NRC auto-tuned atomic hydrogen masers as stable
    frequency references are outlined. Details of both mechanical and electronic construction
    leading to successful clock operation are also discussed. The design of a new
    12.632 MHz frequency synthesizer and modulator with very low spurious sidebands
    is outlined. Methods of partial re-evaluation of systematic errors and frequency
    offsets during clock operation, a procedure necessary in order to maintain primary
    standard accuracy, are described. The accuracy of PT(NRC CsV) is estimated to
    be about ±9 ns per day if all systematic errors are additive, and about ±5 ns
    per day if they act independently in a random manner. The frequency stability
    of PT(NRC CsV) is about 1 to 2 × 10<sup>-14</sup> for periods greater than 4 hours,
    the short term stability being determined by the low cesium beam resonance amplitude
    of 1.6 to 2.0 pA normally employed for clock operation. Replenishment of the two
    cesium ovens is expected to be necessary at intervals of several years.</p>"
