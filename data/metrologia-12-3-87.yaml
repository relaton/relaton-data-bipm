abstract:
- content: "<p>The β-γ transition in oxygen has been realized with a reproducibility
    of ±0.2 mK. The cryostat and techniques used to produce sharp and reproducible
    transitions are described. The results suggest that the β-γ transition may be
    used to provide a further reference temperature below 100 K on the International
    Practical Temperature Scale.</p>"
