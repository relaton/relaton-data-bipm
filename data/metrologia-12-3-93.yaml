abstract:
- content: "<p>The boiling point and triple point of pure oxygen have been realized
    with a reproducibility of ±0.2 and ±0.1 mK respectively. These realizations have
    been used to determine the temperatures of the boiling point of argon as 87.2941
    K and the triple point of argon as 83.7974 K. The reproducibility of these determinations
    was ±0.2 mK. These results are in close agreement with other recent determinations
    and support the adoption of the triple point of argon as an alternative fixed
    point on the IPTS 68 to the boiling point of oxygen. This close agreement indicates
    that, because of the quite different methods used in all the determinations, it
    is unlikely that gross systematic errors exist.</p>"
