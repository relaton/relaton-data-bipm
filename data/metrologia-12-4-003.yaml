abstract:
- content: "<p>A systematic frequency shift which reverses sign with either C field
    or beam reversal and which can be interpreted as the consequence of the Millman
    effect has been found in the new NRC cesium beam clock, CsV. A method of calculating
    the resonance asymmetry resulting from this effect and the dependence on the velocity
    distribution and exciting microwave power level of the frequency shift caused
    by it is described. Application of this theory to CsV leads to reasonable agreement
    with experimental results. Possible origins for the Millman effect in cesium beam
    standards are discussed, and it is concluded that the most likely source is a
    very small variation in the direction of the C field over normal beam trajectories
    within the microwave interaction regions.</p>"
