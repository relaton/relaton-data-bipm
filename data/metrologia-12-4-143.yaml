abstract:
- content: "<p>In the temperature range from 2 to 30 K a comparison has been made
    of a magnetic thermometer based on the magnetic susceptibilities of manganous
    ammonium sulfate (MAS) and gadolinium molybdate (GM) with the readings of a germanium
    resistance thermometer. The magnetic susceptibility was measured by a screened
    selfchecking mutual inductance bridge with an uncertainty of the relative measurements
    being not worse that ±5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. The magnetic thermometer sensitivity
    near 30 K is 0.3 mK with MAS and 0.07 mK with GM. The magnetic thermometer was
    calibrated in terms of the IPTS-68 and T<sub>58</sub> temperature scale with an
    uncertainty of ±0.5 mK. The magnetic temperature scale was determined using the
    MAS data obtained in three experimental runs and GM data taken in two runs. The
    scale was transferred on a germanium resistance thermometer with a root-mean-square
    deviation of the data from the smooth curve of 0.7 mK. The inconsistency previously
    reported in the literature between the IPTS-68 and the T<sub>58</sub> temperature
    scale has been confirmed. The helium normal boiling point temperature on the T<sub>58</sub>
    scale is according to our data too low and must be raised by 9.5 ± 1.5 mK. An
    indirect comparison of our magnetic temperature scale with the results obtained
    by Van Rijn and Durieux as well as with those by Cetas and Swenson has been carried
    out in terms of the NBS P 2-20 K scale. The estimated difference between our data
    and the results of the above authors does not exceed ±3 mK.</p>"
