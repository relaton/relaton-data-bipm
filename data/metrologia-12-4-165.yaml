  content: "<p>This paper compares two procedures for linearizing the output of a
    scanning photoelectric microscope. A method described by Karovic is shown to be
    a practicable alternative to that of Koulicovitch, especially for microscopes
    which set on the flanks of a line. The effects of phase errors in the compensating
    signals are calculated, and are shown to be tolerable.</p>"
