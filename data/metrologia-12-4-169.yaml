abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements were made of the spectrum of one of the collimated<sup>60</sup>Co
    gamma-ray beams employed in the instrument-calibration program of the National
    Bureau of Standards. The high-activity calibration-source capsule was replaced
    by one of low activity and identical geometry. The contributions to the spectrum
    by the scatter from the low-activity replacement source, the housing, and the
    collimation system were isolated by means of supplementary measurements in free
    air carried out on the replacement source and on a scatter-free source. Depending
    on collimator setting, the scatter contribution below 1 MeV was found to be between
    13 and 19 percent of the total number of photons in the beam. A description is
    given of the measurements and of the technique for data reduction. Detailed spectral
    results are presented.</p>"
