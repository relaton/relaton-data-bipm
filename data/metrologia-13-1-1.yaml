abstract:
- content: "<p>A method of correcting measurements in optical or photoelectric pyrometry
    to a reference wavelength is described. This enables the wavelength to be given
    as an instrumental constant in intercomparisons of results. It also allows the
    effects of uncertainties in the characteristics of the pyrometer or the source
    to be studied without lengthy computations, and using only physically significant
    factors.</p>"
