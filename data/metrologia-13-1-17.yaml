abstract:
- content: <p>The NBS primary frequency standard NBS-4 has been operating since January
    1973. NBS-5 operated from January 1973 until March 1974. At this time NBS-5 was
    modified significantly and redesignated NBS-6. The extent and character of these
    design changes are discussed. NBS-6 operation and evaluation began in March 1975.
    Results obtained from NBS-4, NBS-5 and NBS-6 are given, along with intercomparisons
    of some significant parameters.</p><p>During 1975, NBS-4 was operated as a clock
    and a time dispersion of 2.5 ns was obtained for one day. The NBS approach to
    long term clock operation of the primary standards is discussed. These techniques
    will probably involve "accuracy servo" methods, and may lead to very accurate
    clocks with time dispersion less than 1 ns per day.</p>
