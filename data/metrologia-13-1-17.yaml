    <p>The NBS primary frequency standard NBS-4 has been operating since January 1973. NBS-5 operated from January 1973 until March 1974. At this time NBS-5 was modified significantly and redesignated NBS-6. The extent and character of these design changes are discussed. NBS-6 operation and evaluation began in March 1975. Results obtained from NBS-4, NBS-5 and NBS-6 are given, along with intercomparisons of some significant parameters.</p>
    <p>During 1975, NBS-4 was operated as a clock and a time dispersion of 2.5 ns was obtained for one day. The NBS approach to long term clock operation of the primary standards is discussed. These techniques will probably involve "accuracy servo" methods, and may lead to very accurate clocks with time dispersion less than 1 ns per day.</p>
