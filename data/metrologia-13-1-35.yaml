  content: "<p>The current temperature scales for the region 1.1 to 30 K have been
    intercompared by means of 31 germanium resistance thermometers originating from
    eight national laboratories. The scales compared include the International Practical
    Temperature Scale of 1968, the helium vapour pressure scales and various national
    scales based on gas, acoustic and magnetic susceptibility thermometry. While the
    overall scatter between these scales is some 15 mK, the intercomparison reveals
    agreement of the order of 1 mK between the most recent scales based on magnetic
    susceptibility measurements and using common fixed points. The values of the superconductive
    transition temperatures of aluminium, indium and lead on each of the scales have
    been determined.</p>"
