abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured length change vs time for several low thermal expansion
    materials maintained in evacuated environments at constant temperature (near 300
    K). Materials were two types of fused silica, Cer-Vit, ULE, Zerodur, Invar, and
    super Invar. Î”L/L was measured over a period of 170 days to a precision of two
    to three parts in 10<sup>9</sup>. In addition, we have measured time-dependent
    changes in optical contact interfaces and have placed an upper limit on drift
    of optical phase shift on reflection from multilayer dielectric coatings.</p>"
