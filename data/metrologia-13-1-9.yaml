  content: "<p>We have measured length change vs time for several low thermal expansion
    materials maintained in evacuated environments at constant temperature (near 300
    K). Materials were two types of fused silica, Cer-Vit, ULE, Zerodur, Invar, and
    super Invar. Î”<italic>L/L</italic> was measured over a period of 170 days to a
    precision of two to three parts in 10<sup>9</sup>. In addition, we have measured
    time-dependent changes in optical contact interfaces and have placed an upper
    limit on drift of optical phase shift on reflection from multilayer dielectric
    coatings.</p>"
