abstract:
- content: "<p>A novel photo-electric microscope for precise measurement of Line Standards
    is described. Its two distinctive features are: (i) the source of light is a 0.6328
    μm HeNe one milliwatt laser whose beam passes through an astigmatic lens system
    to produce a quasi line image at the scale and (ii) a birefringent crystal splits
    the beam to produce two such images of variable separation so that both sides
    of the scale line are sensed simultaneously. These result in a capability of reading
    good lines to a sensitivity of ± 0.02 μm while the lines move at constant velocity
    under the microscope.</p>"
