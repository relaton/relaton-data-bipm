abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurement of the effects of passing alternating currents in the frequency
    range 10-10<sup>5</sup> Hz through a group of saturated standard cells showed
    that their internal resistances declined with increasing frequency at a mean rate
    of 25 Î©/decade. AC caused the emf's of certain cells to decrease, whereas only
    increases have been previously reported. For most cells, this effect became very
    small for frequencies above 1 kHz. Also, a previously unreported phenomenon, the
    generation of an emf at twice the ac frequency, has been observed. A simple relationship
    between the magnitude of this effect and that of emf change is suggested.</p>"
