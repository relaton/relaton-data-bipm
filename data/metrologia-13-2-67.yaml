abstract:
- content: "<p>The thermal neutron flux density in the Canadian standard has been
    remeasured. Impurities or physical changes in the Am-Be neutron sources as well
    as geometrical changes could have altered the flux density which had originally
    been measured in 1963. A decrease by 1.4% was found; this decrease can be fully
    accounted for by the radioactive decay of<sup>241</sup>Am.</p>"
