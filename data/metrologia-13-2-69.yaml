abstract:
- content: "<p>An improved theory of the instrumental corrections applied to absolute
    radiometers, with the exception of the effect of sensitivity variations across
    the receiver surface, is derived. After a brief review of the historical emergence
    of correction factors and finally of a formal correction theory, as formulated
    by Geist, some shortcomings of this theory are pointed out. Based on a set of
    strict definitions and the conservation of energy principle a revised theory is
    derived and a possible experimental procedure for the determination of the various
    correction factors is described. The new theory also takes into account the influence
    of deviations from linear response, which to a certain extent are present in all
    practical absolute radiometers. The ratio of the mean sensitivities for radiant
    and electrical heating is expressed in terms of either the equivalent or non-equivalent
    heat losses. By analyzing the one-dimensional heat flow through a representative
    model of an absolute radiometer the equivalent and non-equivalent losses are identified.
    At the same time a formal proof for the conception of the equivalence of the heat
    loss through the heater wires is provided. All correction terms in the new theory
    are treated as functions of the applied power and can also be determined as such.
    In conclusion both the scope and the limitations of the theory are discussed.</p>"
