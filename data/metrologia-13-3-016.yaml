abstract:
- content: <p>Atomic or molecular energy levels are shifted by a non-resonant electromagnetic
    irradiation. These so-called "light-shifts" must be carefully taken into account
    in high resolution spectroscopy experiments since they perturb the atomic Bohr
    frequencies which one wants to measure or to use as frequency standards.</p><p>In
    this paper, we present a brief survey of various types of light-shifts corresponding
    to different physical situations. We use a dressed atom approach allowing simple
    physical discussions and simple calculations. Some new suggestions are made.</p>
