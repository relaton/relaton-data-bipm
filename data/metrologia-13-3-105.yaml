abstract:
- content: "<p>Performance of the new 2.1 metre NRC cesium standard during its first
    year of operation as a continuously running primary clock is described. Comparisons
    with the best NRC secondary HP high performance cesium clock and with UTC(USNO)
    and TAI indicate that, after compensation for Loran C discontinuities, the best
    relative value of σ(2, 60 days) is about 2 × 10<sup>-14</sup>.</p>"
