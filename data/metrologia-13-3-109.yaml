  content: "<p>The experiment demonstrated that total spin angular momentum is conserved
    in the near resonant charge transfer collisions between oriented helium ions and
    oriented cesium atoms. The resulting spin dependence of the total charge transfer
    cross-sections is described using singlet and triplet channels based on the molecular
    potential energy curves of the collision pair. The experiment was performed with
    helium ions stored in a rf-quadrupole trap in interaction with an optically pumped
    beam of cesium atoms. Total spin dependent charge transfer cross-sections were
    measured in the energy range of a few eV.</p>"
