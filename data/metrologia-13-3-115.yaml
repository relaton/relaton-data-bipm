abstract:
- content: "<p>A CW single-mode GaAs laser has been used to excite selectively the
    hyperfine components of the D<sub>2</sub> resonance line (8521 Å) in a Cs<sup>133</sup>
    atomic beam. The hyperfine optical pumping was displayed by using a Rabi-type
    detection method. Frequency locking of the GaAs laser to individual hyperfine
    transitions was performed by monitoring the atomic beam fluorescence. On the basis
    of these experimental results, the realization of optically-pumped cesium beam
    frequency standards is discussed.</p>"
