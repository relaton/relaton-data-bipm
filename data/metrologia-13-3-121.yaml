  content: "<p>The present and future roles of the cesium beam frequancy standard
    in time and frequency metrology are discussed briefly. The present limitation
    of the cesium beam device is the uncertainty in the determination of the first-
    and second-order Doppler shifts. These are fundamental problems of all frequency
    standards, and possible solutions in cesium clocks and other standards are mentioned.</p>"
