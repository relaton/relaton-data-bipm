    <p>Measurements have been performed of wall effects (atomic loss rate, wall relaxation and wall shift for a FEP 120 coating) and spin exchange effects (spin exchange cross-section, spin exchange frequency shift) in a hydrogen maser for various temperatures of the wall and the atomic hydrogen gas in the range 77-363 K.</p>
    <p>These experimental results allow a discussion of the phenomena involved in atom-wall collisions. It is shown that the FEP wall behaviour is different according to the temperature range. When the temperature is smaller than 202 K, the wall behaves like a perfect solid and the H atoms are perturbed during weak physical adsorption. When the temperature is greater than 202 K, the wall is no longer a perfect solid: the adsorption sites are modified, or new sites appear, the effects of this change being stronger and stronger when the temperature rises. The phenomena responsible for the loss of atoms on the wall are not modified at 202 K. For temperatures above 296 K, new phenomena appear, which introduce strong positive wall shift and atomic loss, when the temperature rises.</p>
    <p>These changes of the wall behaviour are connected with second order transitions affecting FEP.</p>
    <p>The experimental results relative to spin exchange effects are in good agreement with theoretical calculations by Allison: at room temperature the experimental values for the spin exchange cross section is σ = 23.1 ± 2.8 Å<sup>2</sup> and for the spin exchange frequency shift is λ = 2.5 ± 2.5 Å<sup>2</sup> (the theoretical values are respectively σ = 23.5 ± 2.4 Å<sup>2</sup> and λ = 4.5 ± 0.45 Å<sup>2</sup>). We observe small variations of σ in the considered temperature range and a change of the sign of λ at a temperature around 205 K, as predicted by the theoretical calculations.</p>
