  content: "<p>Model calculations based on a simplified theory for random sampling
    of magnetic field gradients in atomic hydrogen masers predict shifts of the spin
    exchange tuned maser oscillation frequency at levels which affect resettability
    and long term stability of hydrogen maser standards. Strategies for minimizing
    and compensating such effects are presented.</p>"
