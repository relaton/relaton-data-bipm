  content: "<p>Multiwatt Argon Lasers have been short-term and long-term stabilized.
    The laser line width has been reduced from 20 MHz to about 10 kHz and a long term
    stability of 7 × 10<sup>-14</sup> has been achieved by using an I<sub>2</sub>
    molecular beam as a reference. Frequency reproducibility of 1.5 × 10<sup>-12</sup>
    has been demonstrated.</p>"
