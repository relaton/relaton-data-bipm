  content: "<p>Carbon dioxide lasers have been built with a new design for higher
    stability. The frequency stability is found to be better than three parts in 10<sup>11</sup>
    when the lasers are free-running and two orders of magnitude better when they
    are stabilized on saturated absorption resonances of SF<sub>6</sub>. We discuss
    the present limitations of stability, reproducibility and accuracy in these experiments.</p>"
