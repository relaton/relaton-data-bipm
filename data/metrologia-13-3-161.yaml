    <p>Atomic or molecular energy levels are shifted by a non-resonant electromagnetic irradiation. These so-called "light-shifts" must be carefully taken into account in high resolution spectroscopy experiments since they perturb the atomic Bohr frequencies which one wants to measure or to use as frequency standards.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present a brief survey of various types of light-shifts corresponding to different physical situations. We use a dressed atom approach allowing simple physical discussions and simple calculations. Some new suggestions are made.</p>
