abstract:
- content: '<p>High-precision clocks play important roles in experiments to study
    gravitational phenomena. We illustrate these roles by discussing three proposed
    gravitational experiments involving clocks: a "null" gravitational redshift experiment
    using a hydrogen-maser clock and a super-conducting cavity-stabilized oscillator
    (SCSO) clock; a laboratory measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect using a toroidal
    microwave cavity; and a scheme for detecting gravitational waves from distant
    sources by means of doppler tracking of spacecraft, whose feasibility depends
    in part on future improvements in the stabilities of clocks.</p>'
