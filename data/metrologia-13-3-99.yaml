abstract:
- content: "<p>First the main characteristics of the caesium beam time and frequency
    standard CS1 of the PTB are summarized. Then current research work on the improvement
    of CSI is reported: (1) Reduction of the mean beam velocity and the velocity range
    in the beam; (2) detection of small asymmetries of the Ramsey resonance, e.g.,
    due to a shifted Rabi resonance; (3) development of improved analyser deflection
    systems. The efficiencies of beam polarizers using quadrupole magnets or hexapole
    magnets, or combinations of both, have been studied for CS1 achieving the reduction
    of the mean beam velocity to about 100 m/s and the half-width velocity range in
    the beam to about 16%. For the analyser a shaped quadrupole magnet or a combination
    of hexapole and quadrupole magnets should be advantageous. The square root of
    the sum of squares of the uncertainty contributions of CS1 amounts to 0.26 · 10<sup>-13</sup>,
    the official relative uncertainty of CS1 being 1 · 10<sup>-13</sup>.</p>"
