abstract:
- content: <p>In a recent paper entitled "The Millman Effect in Cesium Beam Atomic
    Frequency Standards" (Mungall A G 1976 Metrologia 12 151) a systematic frequency
    shift was observed and explained in terms of the Millman effect. The purpose of
    this note is to suggest that an alternative explanation be sought for the observed
    results.</p>
