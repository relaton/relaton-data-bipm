abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured the ratio of the electron g-factor in hydrogen to
    the proton g-factor in a spherical sample of H<sub>2</sub>O by comparing the electron
    spin frequency, as measured with a hydrogen maser, to the proton spin flip frequency,
    as measured by NMR. The result is g<sub>j</sub>(H)/g<sub>p</sub>́ = 658.216 0091(69)
    [10 parts per billion (ppb)] at a temperature of 34.7°C. This yields a value for
    the proton moment in Bohr magnetons of μ<sub>p</sub>́/μ<sub>B</sub> = 0.001 520
    992 983(17) (11 ppb). Our result differs from the best previous value by 150 ppb.</p>"
