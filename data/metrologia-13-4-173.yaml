  content: <p>In a recent paper entitled "The Millman Effect in Cesium Beam Atomic
    Frequency Standards" (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/12/4/003">Mungall
    A G 1976 Metrologia <bold>12</bold> 151</ext-link>) a systematic frequency shift
    was observed and explained in terms of the Millman effect. The purpose of this
    note is to suggest that an alternative explanation be sought for the observed
    results.</p>
