  content: "<p>We have measured the ratio of the electron <italic>g</italic>-factor
    in hydrogen to the proton <italic>g</italic>-factor in a spherical sample of H<sub>2</sub>O
    by comparing the electron spin frequency, as measured with a hydrogen maser, to
    the proton spin flip frequency, as measured by NMR. The result is <italic>g<sub>j</sub></italic>(H)/<italic>g</italic><sub>p</sub>́
    = 658.216 0091(69) [10 parts per billion (ppb)] at a temperature of 34.7°C. This
    yields a value for the proton moment in Bohr magnetons of μ<sub>p</sub>́/μ<sub>B</sub>
    = 0.001 520 992 983(17) (11 ppb). Our result differs from the best previous value
    by 150 ppb.</p>"
