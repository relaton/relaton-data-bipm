abstract:
- content: "<p>Vapour pressure versus temperature relationships were obtained for
    solid and liquid natural Ne in the temperature range of 20 K &lt; T &lt; 27.1
    K. The effect of various impurities was also investigated and it was found that
    N<sub>2</sub>, in particular, has a noticeable influence upon the triple and the
    boiling points of Ne. The results are compared with other published data and some
    explanation for disagreements is given.</p>"
