  content: "<p>Vapour pressure versus temperature relationships were obtained for
    solid and liquid natural Ne in the temperature range of 20 K &lt; <italic>T</italic>
    &lt; 27.1 K. The effect of various impurities was also investigated and it was
    found that N<sub>2</sub>, in particular, has a noticeable influence upon the triple
    and the boiling points of Ne. The results are compared with other published data
    and some explanation for disagreements is given.</p>"
