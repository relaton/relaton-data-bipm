abstract:
- content: "<p>Feedback is often applied to calorimetric rf power meters to reduce
    the response time. In its usual form such feedback is non-linear, i.e. the loop
    gain varies with signal level. A simple method of linearizing the feedback loop
    is presented and its advantages outlined.</p>"
