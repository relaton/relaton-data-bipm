  content: "<p>Synchrotron radiation has been used to establish spectral emission
    standards for the wavelength range 165 to 350 nm, in an extensive programme of
    work on the Glasgow 340 MeV and Daresbury 5 GeV synchrotrons. Details are given
    of the three different experimental arrangements that have been used, and of the
    characteristics of the specially developed deuterium discharge lamps used as transfer
    standards. As the result of careful attention to systematic errors, the calibrations
    obtained with the different experimental arrangements show close agreement, and
    the overall accuracy of calibration is estimated as ±2.5% at 200 nm and ±3.7%
    at 165 nm.</p>"
