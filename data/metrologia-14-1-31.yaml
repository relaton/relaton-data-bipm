abstract:
- content: "<p>The results obtained up to now by various authors relative to the H
    maser wall shift of FEP 120 and TFE 42 teflons are summarized. New measurements
    of the wall shift for these two types of teflon are described and new results
    are given. A measurement of the hyperfine frequency of the ground state of hydrogen
    is reported; it verifies the validity of the results obtained on the measurements
    of the wall shift.</p>"
