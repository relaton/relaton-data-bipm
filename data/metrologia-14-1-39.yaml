  content: "<p>This paper presents discussion and experimental data to demonstrate
    that: (1) proper measurement of a step-height with interferometry must include
    a determination of the geometry of the surfaces on both sides of the step in the
    neighborhood of the measured area, (2) uncertainty of a step-height measurement
    with the use of interferometry is determined both by uncertainty in the measurement
    of fringe displacement and uncertainty produced by the variation of step height
    measurements with fringe dispersion when specimen geometry is imperfect, (3) when
    specimen geometry is imperfect, uncertainty in calibrating the stylus instrument
    is produced by methods divergence between the height values measured with interferometry
    and with stylus instruments, and (4) uncertainty in assigning a height value to
    a stylus profile of a step is ultimately limited by and is approximately equal
    to the root mean square roughness, or the arithmetical average roughness value
    of the surface texture on both sides of the step.</p>"
