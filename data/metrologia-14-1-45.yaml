abstract:
- content: "<p>The normal boiling and melting points of Xe have been found to be 165.054
    ± 0.001<sub>5</sub> K and 161.3910 ± 0.0002<sub>5</sub> K respectively. The vapour
    pressure of Xe between its normal boiling and melting points can be represented
    as a function of temperature by a simple equation having only three terms. Natural
    Xe appears to be unsuitable as a temperature scale fixed point because its melting
    curve has no well-defined plateau and thus the liquidus point can only be obtained
    by very precise total melting time determinations. Furthermore, the boiling point
    is unsuitable because the estimation of its high aerostatic pressure correction
    may introduce a sizable systematic error.</p>"
