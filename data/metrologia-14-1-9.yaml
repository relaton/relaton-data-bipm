  content: "<p>The boiling point of natural neon has been realized with a reproducibility
    of Â±0.3 mK. The cryostat which is also suitable for vapour pressure measurements
    over a wide range of temperatures is described. The results suggest that in the
    absence of a direct isotope analysis of the neon in the sample chamber, meaningful
    results may be obtained by adding relatively large amounts of neon to the sample
    chamber, never evaporating the liquid, and ensuring that the amount of neon in
    the liquid phase is much greater than that in the vapour phase. Results obtained
    at other institutes do not differ by more than 1.3 mK from the present data.</p>"
