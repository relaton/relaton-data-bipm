  content: "<p>Absolute wavelength measurements of the <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    stabilized He-Ne laser of NRLM have been made by comparison with the <sup>86</sup>Kr
    primary standard using a pressure scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. Vacuum
    wavelength value is given for the i-component of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>.
    The wavelength value obtained is 632991399.95 fm with a standard error of 3 ×
    10<sup>-9</sup>. This agrees with the value recommended by CCDM(632991399 fm)
    within 2 × 10<sup>-9</sup>.</p>"
