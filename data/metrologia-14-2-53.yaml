abstract:
- content: <p>When end standards are measured interferometrically using an auxiliary
    platen a phase correction is needed to compensate for differences in the reflecting
    properties of the end standard and the platen. The phase correction is dependent
    on the complex refractive index of the materials and their roughness. None of
    the established methods of determining the phase correction has proved entirely
    satisfactory and a profiling method which results in an improved consistency of
    results is described.</p><p>A theoretical derivation is outlined which shows that
    under general conditions the "apparent" plane of reflection for a randomly rough
    surface approximates very closely to the mean plane of the surface.</p><p>Results
    of direct measurement of the relation of the apparent plane of reflection, measured
    by an interferometric and a profiling technique, are reported which verify the
    location as the mean plane. The profiling method has been applied in a controlled
    experiment which showed an improvement in the degree of consistency achieved in
    the measurement of gauge blocks.</p><p>The effect of the variability of the refractive
    index of gauge block and platen materials and the presence of contaminants on
    the reflecting surfaces is considered and the results of a survey of the roughness
    of gauge block surfaces are reported.</p>
