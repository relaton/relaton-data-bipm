    <p>A noise thermometer has been developed at IMGC and has been used to realize the Thermodynamic Scale (TS). Differences between TS, as realized at IMGC, and the IPTS-68 were determined in the range 630-962째C and the results are presented.</p>
    <p>The discussion of results primarily deals with the factors introducing measurement uncertainties and with the comparison of noise thermometer results with those of recent radiation thermometry and gas thermometry experiments.</p>
    <p>Data fitting provides the TS versus IPTS-68 differences as a continuous function of the Celsius temperature in the range 630-1064째C. For this, data from monochromatic pyrometry experiments are taken into account in order to cover the range from the freezing point of silver to the freezing point of gold.</p>
