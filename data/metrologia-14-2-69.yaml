abstract:
- content: "<p>A noise thermometer has been developed at IMGC and has been used to
    realize the Thermodynamic Scale (TS). Differences between TS, as realized at IMGC,
    and the IPTS-68 were determined in the range 630-962째C and the results are presented.</p><p>The
    discussion of results primarily deals with the factors introducing measurement
    uncertainties and with the comparison of noise thermometer results with those
    of recent radiation thermometry and gas thermometry experiments.</p><p>Data fitting
    provides the TS versus IPTS-68 differences as a continuous function of the Celsius
    temperature in the range 630-1064째C. For this, data from monochromatic pyrometry
    experiments are taken into account in order to cover the range from the freezing
    point of silver to the freezing point of gold.</p>"
