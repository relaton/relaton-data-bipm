abstract:
- content: "<p>Triple point cells, containing argon and oxygen, from France and Italy
    have been compared with the corresponding triple points maintained at NRC of Canada.
    The results agreed within 0.1 mK for both argon and oxygen between Italy and Canada.
    Between France and Canada, the difference was found to be 0.2 mK and 0.5 mK for
    the argon and the oxygen cells respectively.</p>"
