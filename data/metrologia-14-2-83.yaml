  content: "<p>The triple points of krypton, argon, nitrogen and neon have been realized
    with reproducibilities of ±0.2 mK, ±0.1 mK, ±0.1 mK, and ±0.2 mK respectively.
    The results suggest that the triple points of argon and nitrogen make excellent
    reference temperatures while those of krypton and neon appear to be less suitable,
    possibly due to problems associated with isotope composition.</p>"
