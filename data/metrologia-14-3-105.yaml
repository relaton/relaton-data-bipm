abstract:
- content: "<p>An investigation of the mercury-melting pressure scale for pressures
    between 190 and 750 MPa has been made using a high-stability manganin gauge. Below
    350 MPa the manganin gauge was calibrated against a free-piston gauge. The resistance-pressure
    relationship was extended to 750 MPa with the aid of the well-established mercury
    fixed-point pressure at 0Â°C.</p><p>The melting pressure was located by a quick
    and simple method which depends on the latent heat. Systematic errors arising
    from impurities in the mercury were found to be negligible.</p><p>The results
    differ considerably from the predictions of the equation, based on the Simon equation,
    which has gained some acceptance as a high-pressure standard. They also differ
    somewhat from results given by Michels. However they are in close agreement with
    data recently published by Houck. The experimental pressures have been fitted
    very closely by a third-order polynomial in temperature.</p>"
