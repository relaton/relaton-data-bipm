  content: "<p>In order to utilize the electron synchrotron radiation for the calibration
    of radiometric transfer standards a radiometer has been developed which is in
    use at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg). The radiometer is
    designed for calibrating transfer standards of the spectral radiance and irradiance
    for wavelengths between 80 nm and 350 nm. By the method used it is avoided that
    after calibration with synchrotron radiation the transfer standards have to be
    converted to an absolute scale by comparing them with a conventional standard
    in the uv. This is especially vital for those vuv standards which do not emit
    any measurable radiation in the uv. In this paper the quality of the underlying
    principle of measurement is stressed by determining the spectral radiance of commercial
    deuterium lamps (165 nm to 340 nm). The uncertainty of the measured spectral radiance
    is ±2%. This uncertainty is confirmed by comparative measurements (290 nm to 340
    nm) based on the radiation of tungsten tube black-body at a temperature of about
    2500 K.</p>"
