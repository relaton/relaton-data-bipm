  content: "<p>The atmospheric correction for the propagation velocity of gamma rays
    is determined to be less than 25 ppm for a pressure variation of 5 atmospheres
    using a positron lifetime spectrometer. A means of using the lifetime spectrometer
    as an instrument for distance measurements is outlined and the accuracy and maximum
    measureable distance evaluated.</p>"
