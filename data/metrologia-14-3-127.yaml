    <p>The cross-sections for the reactions <sup>56</sup>Fe(n, p)<sup>56</sup>Mn, <sup>63</sup>Cu(n, 2n)<sup>62</sup>Cu and <sup>65</sup>Cu(n, 2n)<sup>64</sup>Cu for neutron energies from 14 to 19 MeV were measured by the activation technique, using a proton recoil telescope to determine the neutron flux. The uncertainties, ranging from 2 to 6%, were estimated at approximately the 99% confidence level. Less accurate measurements of the <sup>54</sup>Fe(n, 2n)<sup>53</sup>Fe, <sup>65</sup>Cu(n, p)<sup>65</sup>Ni and <sup>65</sup>Cu(n, nα)<sup>61</sup>Co cross-sections were also made. A detailed account of the experimental procedure is given, and the results are compared with several recent evaluations. No fine structure was observed in the <sup>56</sup>Fe(n, p)<sup>56</sup>Mn cross-section over the range from 17.5 to 17.9 MeV.</p>
    <p>The half-life of <sup>62</sup>Cu was found to be 9.73 ± 0.06 min, where the uncertainty is approximately at the 99% confidence level.</p>
    <p>The measured <sup>56</sup>Fe(n, p)<sup>56</sup>Mn cross-section will be used as a secondary standard at the NPL for determining monoenergetic neutron flux densities from 14 to 19 MeV by the activation technique.</p>
