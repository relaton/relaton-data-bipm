abstract:
- content: "<p>The cross-sections for the reactions<sup>56</sup>Fe(n, p)<sup>56</sup>Mn,<sup>63</sup>Cu(n,
    2n)<sup>62</sup>Cu and<sup>65</sup>Cu(n, 2n)<sup>64</sup>Cu for neutron energies
    from 14 to 19 MeV were measured by the activation technique, using a proton recoil
    telescope to determine the neutron flux. The uncertainties, ranging from 2 to
    6%, were estimated at approximately the 99% confidence level. Less accurate measurements
    of the<sup>54</sup>Fe(n, 2n)<sup>53</sup>Fe,<sup>65</sup>Cu(n, p)<sup>65</sup>Ni
    and<sup>65</sup>Cu(n, nα)<sup>61</sup>Co cross-sections were also made. A detailed
    account of the experimental procedure is given, and the results are compared with
    several recent evaluations. No fine structure was observed in the<sup>56</sup>Fe(n,
    p)<sup>56</sup>Mn cross-section over the range from 17.5 to 17.9 MeV.</p><p>The
    half-life of<sup>62</sup>Cu was found to be 9.73 ± 0.06 min, where the uncertainty
    is approximately at the 99% confidence level.</p><p>The measured<sup>56</sup>Fe(n,
    p)<sup>56</sup>Mn cross-section will be used as a secondary standard at the NPL
    for determining monoenergetic neutron flux densities from 14 to 19 MeV by the
    activation technique.</p>"
