  content: "<p>The triple point temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>tp</sub>) of
    argon and oxygen were realized by a calorimetric technique with an accuracy of
    ±0·15 mK. Their values lie within 0.5 mK of the most recent determinations carried
    out in other laboratories. Errors in <italic>T</italic><sub>tp</sub> due to the
    cryostat and to impurities were extensively investigated. After initial conditioning,
    the gases were sealed into triple point cells, in which <italic>T</italic><sub>tp</sub>
    was stable at the quoted accuracy over a two-year period. The triple point pressure
    of oxygen was found to be 146.2<sub>5</sub> ± 0.4 Pa. An extensive bibliography
    of solid-solid equilibria of mixtures with Ar and O<sub>2</sub> is also given.</p>"
