abstract:
- content: "<p>The triple point temperatures (T<sub>tp</sub>) of argon and oxygen
    were realized by a calorimetric technique with an accuracy of ±0·15 mK. Their
    values lie within 0.5 mK of the most recent determinations carried out in other
    laboratories. Errors in T<sub>tp</sub> due to the cryostat and to impurities were
    extensively investigated. After initial conditioning, the gases were sealed into
    triple point cells, in which T<sub>tp</sub> was stable at the quoted accuracy
    over a two-year period. The triple point pressure of oxygen was found to be 146.2<sub>5</sub>
    ± 0.4 Pa. An extensive bibliography of solid-solid equilibria of mixtures with
    Ar and O<sub>2</sub> is also given.</p>"
