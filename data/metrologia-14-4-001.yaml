abstract:
- content: "<p>A combination of the two current practical scales of temperature (EPT-76
    and IPTS-68) in the range 1 K to 83 K has been shown to produce a scale which
    is irregular with respect to the most recent thermodynamic data. We suggest an
    alternative practical scale, T<sub>77,NML</sub>, which covers the range 1 to 273.16
    K and is based on the best available thermodynamic data below 83 K and on the
    present IPTS-68 above 83 K. T<sub>77,NML</sub> provides a means of calibrating
    resistance thermometers in this range in a manner superior in accuracy, thermodynamic
    smoothness and ease of use to that provided by the current practical scales of
    temperature. Certain inconsistencies between T<sub>77,NML</sub> and IPTS-68 suggest
    that there should be a redetermination of the thermodynamic temperature of the
    triple point of oxygen.</p>"
