abstract:
- content: "<p>The efficiency of the method of least squares depends substantially
    upon the choice of the design matrix, since the latter is responsible for the
    transfer of the uncertainties, inherent in the initial observations, to the unknown
    parameters. The present paper suggests that the transfer is best if, given the
    diagonal elements Á<sub>i</sub>A<sub>i</sub> of the product matrix Á A, the columns
    of the design matrix A are mutually orthogonal.</p>"
