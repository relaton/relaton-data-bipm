  content: "<p>A combination of the two current practical scales of temperature (EPT-76
    and IPTS-68) in the range 1 K to 83 K has been shown to produce a scale which
    is irregular with respect to the most recent thermodynamic data. We suggest an
    alternative practical scale, <italic>T</italic><sub>77,NML</sub>, which covers
    the range 1 to 273.16 K and is based on the best available thermodynamic data
    below 83 K and on the present IPTS-68 above 83 K. <italic>T</italic><sub>77,NML</sub>
    provides a means of calibrating resistance thermometers in this range in a manner
    superior in accuracy, thermodynamic smoothness and ease of use to that provided
    by the current practical scales of temperature. Certain inconsistencies between
    <italic>T</italic><sub>77,NML</sub> and IPTS-68 suggest that there should be a
    redetermination of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of oxygen.</p>"
