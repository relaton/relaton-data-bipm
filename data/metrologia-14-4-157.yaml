  content: "<p>The internal conversion coefficients of the 662 keV transition in <sup>137</sup>Ba
    have been determined by the PBS method using an iron-free, double-focusing β-ray
    spectrometer. The results, with overall 68% confidence limits, were α<sub><italic>T</italic></sub>
    = 0.1092 ± 0.0008 and α<sub><italic>K</italic></sub> = 0.0888 ± 0.0007. In addition,
    the intensities per disintegration of the high-energy β-branch and of the 662
    keV γ-ray were determined to be (6.21 ± 0.07)% and (84.56 ± 0.08)% respectively,
    and the value (513.89 ± 0.26) keV was obtained for the endpoint energy of the
    inner β-branch.</p>"
