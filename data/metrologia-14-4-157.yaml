abstract:
- content: "<p>The internal conversion coefficients of the 662 keV transition in<sup>137</sup>Ba
    have been determined by the PBS method using an iron-free, double-focusing β-ray
    spectrometer. The results, with overall 68% confidence limits, were α<sub>T</sub>
    = 0.1092 ± 0.0008 and α<sub>K</sub> = 0.0888 ± 0.0007. In addition, the intensities
    per disintegration of the high-energy β-branch and of the 662 keV γ-ray were determined
    to be (6.21 ± 0.07)% and (84.56 ± 0.08)% respectively, and the value (513.89 ±
    0.26) keV was obtained for the endpoint energy of the inner β-branch.</p>"
