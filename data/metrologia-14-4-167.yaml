  content: "<p>The PTB has improved the maintenance of the volt with the aid of a
    new standard cell enclosure containing 32 cells monitored by the Josephson reference
    voltage. The paper gives detailed information on the construction and the operational
    experience of the thermo-regulated air-bath enclosure. Since February 1976, a
    group of 25 standard cells in the new enclosure, in conjunction with the Josephson
    voltage standard, has represented the volt at the PTB. The extremely small drift
    of the mean value of the emf of this group is considerably smaller than one part
    in 10<sup>8</sup> per year.</p>"
