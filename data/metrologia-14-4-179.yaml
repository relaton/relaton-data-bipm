    <p>A theoretical analysis is given of the stabilities obtainable with Rabi and Ramsey interrogation methods in divergent beams. The performances of both techniques in frequency standard applications are strongly degraded by first order Doppler effect when the divergence is such that the beam width becomes comparable with the transition wavelength.</p>
    <p>Upper limits exist for the stability obtainable in both configurations, with given beam intensity and detection efficiency, and for the frequency at which that maximum is reachable in mechanically collimated beams. Non-mechanical collimation (e.g. saturated absorption) should be used in order to reach that maximum at higher frequencies.</p>
    <p>Doppler-free interrogation methods appear to be the only way to remove these upper limits.</p>
