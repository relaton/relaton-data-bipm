abstract:
- content: "<p>A theoretical analysis is given of the stabilities obtainable with
    Rabi and Ramsey interrogation methods in divergent beams. The performances of
    both techniques in frequency standard applications are strongly degraded by first
    order Doppler effect when the divergence is such that the beam width becomes comparable
    with the transition wavelength.</p><p>Upper limits exist for the stability obtainable
    in both configurations, with given beam intensity and detection efficiency, and
    for the frequency at which that maximum is reachable in mechanically collimated
    beams. Non-mechanical collimation (e.g. saturated absorption) should be used in
    order to reach that maximum at higher frequencies.</p><p>Doppler-free interrogation
    methods appear to be the only way to remove these upper limits.</p>"
