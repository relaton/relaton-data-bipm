abstract:
- content: "<p>The equiprobable interval method of sample classification is examined
    and applied to a large sample of residuals from a gravimeter network adjustment.
    This method seems to possess several advantages over the commonly used constant
    interval method insofar as the validity of the χ<sup>2</sup> test is concerned.</p>"
