abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe a measurement, accurate to a part in a million, of the
    gyromagnetic ratio of the proton in water, γ'<sub>p</sub>, by the strong field
    method. The magnetic induction of a magnet is measured by weighing the force exerted
    on a rectangular current-carrying coil which has its lower end in the pole-gap.
    Simultaneously the precession frequency of protons in a water sample in this field
    is obtained by a conventional nuclear magnetic resonance technique. γ'<sub>p</sub>
    is then the ratio of the precession frequency to the magnetic flux density.</p><p>The
    significance of the measurement lies not only in the use of the result to calibrate
    magnetic fields in SI units for other accurate measurements of atomic constants,
    but also in the realization of the SI definition of the ampere which follows from
    combining the result with the measurement of γ́<sub>p</sub> by the weak-field
    technique.</p><p>Our result is γ'<sub>p</sub> = 2.6751701(27) × 10<sup>8</sup>
    s<sup>-1</sup>  T<sub>B169</sub><sup>-1</sup> for a spherical water sample at
    20°C, where the standard error in the last two digits is in parenthesis.</p>"
