abstract:
- content: "<p>A better interpolating instrument has long been needed to replace the
    standard platinum-10% rhodium/platinum thermocouple for the International Practical
    Temperature Scale. In this paper we compare the characteristics of the high temperature
    platinum resistance thermometer and the photoelectric spectral pyrometer with
    those of the standard thermocouple and conclude that the resistance thermometer
    is the better replacement, in terms of both accuracy and convenience.</p>"
