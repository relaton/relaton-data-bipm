  content: "<p>An experimental investigation has been made of the irreproducibility
    of the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 below 273.15 K. Ten national
    standards laboratories submitted a total of 23 capsule-type platinum resistance
    thermometers to NPL where, together with a further 14 NPL thermometers, they were
    intercompared at 50 temperatures between 4.2 and 373.15 K. Most of the thermometers
    submitted had been calibrated on IPTS-68 as realized in the laboratory of their
    origin and our measurements thus allow us not only to compare fixed point realizations
    and the resulting differing versions of <italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub>, but also
    to separate the component of irreproducibility that results from fixed point differences
    from that which reflects intrinsic thermometer variation. As a result of these
    measurements it is clear that differences between calibrations at the fixed points
    are the major cause of irreproducibility in IPTS-68 and that progress towards
    a more reproducible scale will come most readily through a reassessment of the
    choice of defining fixed points and the manner of their realization.</p>"
