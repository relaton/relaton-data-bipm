abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental investigation has been made of the irreproducibility
    of the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 below 273.15 K. Ten national
    standards laboratories submitted a total of 23 capsule-type platinum resistance
    thermometers to NPL where, together with a further 14 NPL thermometers, they were
    intercompared at 50 temperatures between 4.2 and 373.15 K. Most of the thermometers
    submitted had been calibrated on IPTS-68 as realized in the laboratory of their
    origin and our measurements thus allow us not only to compare fixed point realizations
    and the resulting differing versions of T<sub>68</sub>, but also to separate the
    component of irreproducibility that results from fixed point differences from
    that which reflects intrinsic thermometer variation. As a result of these measurements
    it is clear that differences between calibrations at the fixed points are the
    major cause of irreproducibility in IPTS-68 and that progress towards a more reproducible
    scale will come most readily through a reassessment of the choice of defining
    fixed points and the manner of their realization.</p>"
