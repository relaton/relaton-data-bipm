abstract:
- content: "<p>From accurate measurements on a set of sealed cells, each reproducible
    to within Â±0.2 mK, the temperature value for the triple point of methane was found
    to be 90.6856 K, with a range of 1 mK depending on which one of ten thermometers
    was used. All thermometers were calibrated on IPTS-68 using T(Ar) = 83.798 K.
    On the contrary, when IPTS-68 calibration of the same thermometers was considered,
    based on the condensation point of oxygen as realized in different laboratories,
    a spread of 3.6 mK was found for the values of both the argon and the methane
    triple points.</p>"
