abstract:
- content: "<p>The background, derivation and estimated thermodynamic accuracy are
    given for a provisional temperature scale, the EPT-76, which is intended to alleviate
    inconsistencies which exist between the liquid helium vapour pressure scales and
    the IPTS-68 and which prevent a thermodynamically smooth interpolation. Brief
    discussions and references are given for the use of the magnetic and gas thermometers
    which are the recommended interpolation instruments for realizing this scale.</p>"
