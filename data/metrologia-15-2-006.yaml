abstract:
- content: "<p>P-V isotherm thermometry has been used to obtain a value of 20.271<sub>2</sub>
    K for the normal boiling point of equilibrium hydrogen, the total uncertainty,
    expressed as a 99% confidence limit, being ±1.0 mK. Based on this fixed point
    as a reference temperature a constant volume gas thermometry scale, NPL-75, has
    been produced, which covers the range from 2.6 K to 27.1 K. Corrections for the
    non-ideality of the thermometric gas,<sup>4</sup>He, were made with virial coefficients
    derived from measurements of P-V isotherms in the same temperature range. The
    uncertainty of NPL-75, expressed as a 99% confidence limit, is ±0.4 mK, and it
    is estimated that the scale does not deviate from thermodynamic temperature by
    more than 0.3 mK, 0.9 mK and 1.4 mK at 4 K, 20 K and 27 K respectively. NPL-75
    has been compared with IPTS-68,  T<sub>58</sub> and  T<sub>XISU</sub> (1975).</p>"
