abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this paper is to discuss the design and performance
    of a primary standard barometer and a primary standard pressure balance, and to
    describe in detail a direct intercomparison between the two instruments within
    their optimum operating range. The uncertainties associated with each pressure
    standard are discussed together with an estimate of the uncertainties associated
    with the intercomparison experiment itself. At a pressure of 100 kPa the two methods
    agree to within 1.2 Â± 1.4 Pa at the 99.7% confidence level.</p>"
