  content: "<p>The hyperfine spectra of the B <sup>3</sup>π-X <sup>1</sup>Σ system
    of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> have been studied by intra-cavity saturation at
    515 nm, 521 nm, 531 nm and 568 nm with an argon/krypton ion laser. Several previously
    unreported spectra have been identified by analysis of the sidelight fluorescence
    from the iodine cell. The laser has been stabilized to saturated components at
    each of these wavelengths and wavelength values are reported with uncertainties
    of ±1 in 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>"
