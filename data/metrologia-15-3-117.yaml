abstract:
- content: "<p>The hyperfine spectra of the B<sup>3</sup>π-X<sup>1</sup>Σ system of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    have been studied by intra-cavity saturation at 515 nm, 521 nm, 531 nm and 568
    nm with an argon/krypton ion laser. Several previously unreported spectra have
    been identified by analysis of the sidelight fluorescence from the iodine cell.
    The laser has been stabilized to saturated components at each of these wavelengths
    and wavelength values are reported with uncertainties of ±1 in 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>"
