abstract:
- content: "<p>A design of detectors whose receivers have thermoelements and thermal
    paths on their periphery is shown. A uniform response is obtained by decreasing
    heat losses from the receiver. This can be achieved by operating the detector
    in a vacuum, placing a hemispherical mirror in front of the receiver, and lowering
    the temperature of the detector. The exact solutions of the equation of thermal
    conduction and the response distributions are given for a thin circular receiver.
    The calculations show that the non-uniformity of response of the order of 10<sup>-6</sup>
    is obtained for a receiver (aluminum disk, 10 mm in diameter and 20 Î¼m thick)
    equipped with a hemispherical mirror and operated at liquid nitrogen temperature.
    The non-uniformity of response, arising from difficulties encountered in setting
    up the detectors, is expected to be confined within 10<sup>-4</sup> by careful
    treatment.</p>"
