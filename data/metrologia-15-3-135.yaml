  content: "<p>High-stability tungsten strip lamps are assessed as a means of maintaining
    the International Practical Temperature Scale below 1064.43°C. The variation of
    spectral radiance temperature with changes in the lamps and their environment
    is discussed. Factors necessary to correct the spectral radiance temperature for
    changes in the resistance and pin temperature of two lamps are given. It is shown
    that applying corrections for changes in lamp resistance reduces the uncertainty
    in the use of lamps by an order of magnitude. The uncertainties which are to be
    associated with the use of tungsten strip lamps under practical conditions are
    0.015°C at 1064°C and 0.045°C at 770°C (99% confidence limits). These results
    indicate that the platinum resistance thermometer appears to be a better alternative
    means of maintaining temperature scales in the range considered.</p>"
