abstract:
- content: "<p>A cryostat used to realize the boiling point and 17 K point of equilibrium
    hydrogen is described and the methods used to realize these fixed points and also
    the triple point are discussed. Apparatus used to convert hydrogen from the normal
    to equilibrium composition is also described. The results are in close agreement
    with other recent determinations.</p>"
