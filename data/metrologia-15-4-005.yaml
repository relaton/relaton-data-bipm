abstract:
- content: "<p>We have determined the triple-point temperature of high-purity gallium
    to be 29.77406°C using three standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs)
    calibrated on the IPTS-68 and using samples of gallium from three commercial sources.
    All data obtained on the highest purity sample have a standard deviation of ±0.00011°C.
    The overall systematic uncertainty is estimated to be<sup>+0.6</sup><sub>-1.1</sub>
    m°C. The day-to-day irreproducibility of a single melt of each gallium cell was
    found to be &lt; ±15 μ°C, while over a period of 7 months the irreproducibility
    among melts of each gallium cell was ⩽ ±0.00011°C. These limits on the reproducibility
    appear to be largely instrumental since every time an SPRT was left in a gallium
    cell for several days there was no change in the indicated temperature of the
    triple-point to within the instrumental resolution of ±1.5 μ°C. The pressure dependence
    was measured and determined to be dT/dP = -2.011 ± 0.001 m°C/atm.</p>"
