abstract:
- content: "<p>Transfer of the National Measurement Laboratory's photometric scales
    to a radiometric base has been completed by using a new precision goniophotometer
    to realize a scale of total luminous flux from the previously established scale
    of illuminance. The uncertainties in the goniophotometry are well below those
    in the scale of illuminance.</p>"
