abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate measurements of high radiant flux ratios require detailed
    knowledge about detector nonlinearity. The double aperture method employed yields
    a quantity NL, that is twice the linearity error of the detection system when
    a flux ratio of two is measured. An arbitrary flux ratio can be corrected for
    nonlinearity by a straightforward analytical procedure if NL is a unique, smooth
    and reproducibly measureable function of photocurrent and wavelength. NL also
    must be known up to the highest photocurrent involved in the flux ratio measurement.
    Spectral nonlinearity characteristics of low noise silicon detectors have been
    measured at photocurrents between 3 × 10<sup>-10</sup> A and 10<sup>-7</sup> A
    and wavelengths between 600 nm and 1100 nm. The analytical correction procedure
    has been verified by transmission measurements involving a flux ratio of about
    200 with a residual linearity error below 1.6 × 10<sup>-4</sup> at constant preamplifier
    sensitivity. The dynamic range covered reached about 2000. Therefore flux ratios
    of about 2000 can be measured with such accuracy by one step if the preamplifier
    sensitivity is changed by an accurately known factor above ten. Consequently in
    radiation thermometry with silicon detectors the temperature error due to detector
    nonlinearity can be kept below 10 mK between gold point and zinc point.</p>"
