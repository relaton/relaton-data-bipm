  content: "<p>Accurate measurements of high radiant flux ratios require detailed
    knowledge about detector nonlinearity. The double aperture method employed yields
    a quantity <italic>NL</italic>, that is twice the linearity error of the detection
    system when a flux ratio of two is measured. An arbitrary flux ratio can be corrected
    for nonlinearity by a straightforward analytical procedure if <italic>NL</italic>
    is a unique, smooth and reproducibly measureable function of photocurrent and
    wavelength. <italic>NL</italic> also must be known up to the highest photocurrent
    involved in the flux ratio measurement. Spectral nonlinearity characteristics
    of low noise silicon detectors have been measured at photocurrents between 3 ×
    10<sup>-10</sup> A and 10<sup>-7</sup> A and wavelengths between 600 nm and 1100
    nm. The analytical correction procedure has been verified by transmission measurements
    involving a flux ratio of about 200 with a residual linearity error below 1.6
    × 10<sup>-4</sup> at constant preamplifier sensitivity. The dynamic range covered
    reached about 2000. Therefore flux ratios of about 2000 can be measured with such
    accuracy by one step if the preamplifier sensitivity is changed by an accurately
    known factor above ten. Consequently in radiation thermometry with silicon detectors
    the temperature error due to detector nonlinearity can be kept below 10 mK between
    gold point and zinc point.</p>"
