abstract:
- content: "<p>In much primary pressure-volume and acoustic thermometry in the range
    2.5-27 K appreciable benefit could be expected from smoothing the slopes of the
    isotherms and refitting them with the smoothed slopes. Since the isotherms are
    generally few in number, it is desirable to find a realistic form for the temperature
    dependence of the corresponding virial coefficients which has only two or three
    undetermined coefficients. The commonly suggested form, a + bT<sup>−1</sup> +
    δ(T), δ(T) being a small single term adjustment, is investigated on the basis
    of the direct and exchange<sup>4</sup>He phase shift sums, G<sub>+</sub>(k) and
    G<sub>−</sub>(k), given by Boyd, Larsen and Kilpatrick (BLK). It is shown that
    only a limited region of the G<sub>+</sub>(k) curve contributes significantly
    to the value of B(T) for most of the range of interest and that this has a particularly
    simple form leading to the terms a + bT<sup>−1</sup>. But, as BLK found, this
    is of insufficient accuracy to represent B(T) over the full range. In order to
    extend its usefulness two small but significant calculated corrections are proposed,
    one to allow for the effect of the exchange phase shift sum G<sub>−</sub>(k) and
    one to compensate for ignoring low momentum features of the direct sum G<sub>+</sub>(k).
    A plausible, but somewhat arbitrary, form for δ(T), cT<sup>−1/2</sup>, is also
    deduced from the G<sub>+</sub>(k) curve, though, having inserted the two corrections,
    it makes only a small contribution to the smoothing procedure. From these considerations
    recommendations for smoothing thermometry isotherm slopes are deduced and assessed
    numerically. It is found that they can considerably enhance the quality of all
    but the finest work. They also facilitate the derivation of acoustic virial coefficients
    from pressure-volume virial coefficients and vice versa. The indirect dependence
    of the recommendations on the obsolete Lennard-Jones potential on which BLK based
    their phase shifts is argued to be inconsequential.</p>"
