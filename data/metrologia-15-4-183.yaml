  content: "<p>In much primary pressure-volume and acoustic thermometry in the range
    2.5-27 K appreciable benefit could be expected from smoothing the slopes of the
    isotherms and refitting them with the smoothed slopes. Since the isotherms are
    generally few in number, it is desirable to find a realistic form for the temperature
    dependence of the corresponding virial coefficients which has only two or three
    undetermined coefficients. The commonly suggested form, <italic>a + bT </italic><sup>−1</sup>
    + δ(<italic>T</italic>), δ(<italic>T</italic>) being a small single term adjustment,
    is investigated on the basis of the direct and exchange <sup>4</sup>He phase shift
    sums, <italic>G</italic><sub>+</sub>(<italic>k</italic>) and <italic>G</italic><sub>−</sub>(<italic>k</italic>),
    given by Boyd, Larsen and Kilpatrick (BLK). It is shown that only a limited region
    of the <italic>G</italic><sub>+</sub>(<italic>k</italic>) curve contributes significantly
    to the value of <italic>B</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) for most of the range of
    interest and that this has a particularly simple form leading to the terms <italic>a
    + bT </italic><sup>−1</sup>. But, as BLK found, this is of insufficient accuracy
    to represent <italic>B</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) over the full range. In order
    to extend its usefulness two small but significant calculated corrections are
    proposed, one to allow for the effect of the exchange phase shift sum <italic>G</italic><sub>−</sub>(<italic>k</italic>)
    and one to compensate for ignoring low momentum features of the direct sum <italic>G</italic><sub>+</sub>(<italic>k</italic>).
    A plausible, but somewhat arbitrary, form for δ(<italic>T</italic>), <italic>cT
    </italic><sup>−1/2</sup>, is also deduced from the <italic>G</italic><sub>+</sub>(<italic>k</italic>)
    curve, though, having inserted the two corrections, it makes only a small contribution
    to the smoothing procedure. From these considerations recommendations for smoothing
    thermometry isotherm slopes are deduced and assessed numerically. It is found
    that they can considerably enhance the quality of all but the finest work. They
    also facilitate the derivation of acoustic virial coefficients from pressure-volume
    virial coefficients and vice versa. The indirect dependence of the recommendations
    on the obsolete Lennard-Jones potential on which BLK based their phase shifts
    is argued to be inconsequential.</p>"
