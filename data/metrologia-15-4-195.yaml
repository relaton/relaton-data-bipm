abstract:
- content: "<p>An NQR thermometer has been calibrated to IPTS-68 over the temperature
    range 203 K to 398 K. The fully automatic NQR thermometer which uses KClO<sub>3</sub>
    was developed by Yokogawa Electric Works, Ltd. (YEW). It was calibrated at the
    National Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM) by comparison with a standard
    platinum resistance thermometer.</p><p>A total of 543 temperature-NQR frequency
    data points, including the first precise data for this type of thermometer above
    297 K, were obtained in 67 calibration runs at 21 distinct temperature regions
    for two sample probes. An 8th order polynomial was fitted to the 67 averaged temperature-NQR
    frequency data (from calibration runs) using the method of least squares.</p><p>The
    standard deviation of the 67 averaged data from the polynomial was ±1.66 Hz. Ninety-five
    per cent of the original 543 data points were within ±1.13 mK of the fitted polynomial.
    This represents the overall accuracy of the NQR thermometer under the test conditions,
    allowing for frequency-to-temperature conversion, reproducibility of absorption
    frequency measurement, and probe interchangeability.</p>"
