    <p>An NQR thermometer has been calibrated to IPTS-68 over the temperature range 203 K to 398 K. The fully automatic NQR thermometer which uses KClO<sub>3</sub> was developed by Yokogawa Electric Works, Ltd. (YEW). It was calibrated at the National Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM) by comparison with a standard platinum resistance thermometer.</p>
    <p>A total of 543 temperature-NQR frequency data points, including the first precise data for this type of thermometer above 297 K, were obtained in 67 calibration runs at 21 distinct temperature regions for two sample probes. An 8th order polynomial was fitted to the 67 averaged temperature-NQR frequency data (from calibration runs) using the method of least squares.</p>
    <p>The standard deviation of the 67 averaged data from the polynomial was ±1.66 Hz. Ninety-five per cent of the original 543 data points were within ±1.13 mK of the fitted polynomial. This represents the overall accuracy of the NQR thermometer under the test conditions, allowing for frequency-to-temperature conversion, reproducibility of absorption frequency measurement, and probe interchangeability.</p>
