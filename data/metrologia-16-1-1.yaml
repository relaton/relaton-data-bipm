  content: "<p>For highly accurate measurements of specular gloss according to ISO
    Standard 2813 (or ASTM D523), a special instrument was designed and construction
    details are given. This instrument is used for routine measurements as well as
    for special studies on the stability of the gloss of paint samples, etc. It also
    serves as a reference instrument in the Collaborative Reference Programm on Color
    and Appearance sponsored by the Manufacturers Council of Color and Appearance
    USA and the National Bureau of Standards.</p>"
