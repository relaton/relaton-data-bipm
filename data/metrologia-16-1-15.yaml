abstract:
- content: "<p>The potential distribution inside a parallel-plate guarded-wall chamber
    is expressed in terms of harmonic function series. Field distortion is described
    by excursions of the electrostatic field lines determining the collection volume
    of the chamber. Design data are derived including the two-dimensional basic case,
    the effect of the top and bottom walls, and the effect of perturbations in the
    guard wall. The data can be used to design free-air chambers with a collection
    volume loss of a small fraction of one per cent, a value determined primarily
    by the precision in the construction of the guard wall.</p>"
