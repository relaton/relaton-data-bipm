abstract:
- content: "<p>The mercury melting line has been determined for pressures up to 1200
    MPa. The change of electrical resistance in the mercury sample was used for detecting
    the equilibrium between the solid and liquid phases. Pressure measurements were
    made with highly stable manganin gages calibrated against two controlled clearance
    piston gages. Temperature measurements were made in the constant temperature bath
    by means of platinum resistance thermometry. Systematic errors in pressure and
    temperature were evaluated for all the measurements as well as the scatter due
    to the resolution of the equilibrium determination between the two phases of mercury.
    The mercury melting point at 0 °C is 756.84 ± 0.16 MPa which is in close agreement
    with the value obtained by Dadson and Greig. The experimental results are compared
    with previous melting lines. There are systematic differences when compared to
    Bogdanov's equation up to 1200 MPa but there is very close agreement with recent
    data obtained by Houck and Morris over the pressure range they covered. The experimental
    data were fitted to a third order polynomial; this equation fits the melting line
    data much more closely than the Simon type heretofore recommended and can be used
    up to 1200 MPa to increase the accuracy of a practical pressure scale based on
    the melting line of mercury.</p>"
