  content: "<p>An international flux density comparison of monoenergetic fast neutrons
    has been organized by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. Nine laboratories
    carried out measurements which extended from December 1973 to February 1978. The
    five neutron energies 250 keV, 565 keV, 2.2 MeV, 2.5 MeV and 14.8 MeV were selected.
    A polyethylene sphere with a small BF<sub>3</sub> counter at the center served
    as a transfer instrument at all energies except for 14.8 MeV. A <sup>3</sup>He
    proportional counter was used at the two lower energies as the second transfer
    instrument. At 14.8 MeV a fission chamber (<sup>238</sup>U) and the iron foil
    activation method based on the <sup>56</sup>Fe (n,p) <sup>56</sup>Mn reaction
    were used. The experimental conditions, the neutron flux density determinations
    and the transfer instrument measurements are described. The results of the intercomparison
    are summarized in tables and graphs.</p>"
