  content: <p>The structure of the design matrix of a system of equations of condition
    which are formed in taking the observations for calibration of a "series of mass
    standards", has a strong influence on the accuracy of the results. It was suggested
    by Prowse and Anderson (1974) that the best system of equations, both from the
    standpoint of the ease of numerical calculations and the magnitude of the standard
    deviations on individual components, is that in which the design matrix is orthogonal.
    Grabe (1978), by introducing the principle that some of the possible equations
    may be omitted and some repeated, produced a system in the series 10, 5, 3, 2,
    1, 1', the design matrix of which is orthogonal. The present article describes
    an original method which conforms to Grabe's principles and leads to systems of
    equations which possess orthogonal matrices and which can be easily applied to
    various "series of mass standards" used in practical metrology.</p>
