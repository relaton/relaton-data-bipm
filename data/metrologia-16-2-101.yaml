abstract:
- content: "<p>Two-photon excitation of gas atoms by two counter-propagating frequency
    modulated laser beams is investigated with the help of second order perturbation
    theory. Simple spectra nearly free of Doppler broadening can be obtained from
    a region of the sample where the sum frequency of the two beams is constant. The
    comb of equally spaced laser modes can thus be locked to a resonant two-photon
    transition, providing calibration markers for the measurement of large optical
    frequency intervals.</p>"
