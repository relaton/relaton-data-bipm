abstract:
- content: "<p>A frequency-offset locked spectrometer has been used to study the saturated
    absorption spectra of iodine at 633 nm. The results show very high resolution
    and have a particularly accurate frequency scale. Three absorption lines have
    been studied in greater detail using curve fitting techniques. The laser system
    is described, including a novel resonant mirror mount.</p>"
