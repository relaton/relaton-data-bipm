  content: "<p>A single-crystal cerous magnesium nitrate (CMN) paramagnetic salt thermometer
    has been set up and used for therometry between 0.4 K and 3.1 K in a cryostat
    also equipped for the measurement of the vapour pressures of <sup>3</sup>He and
    <sup>4</sup>He. Two temperature scales, <italic>T<sub>X 1</sub></italic> and <italic>T<sub>X
    2</sub></italic>, have been derived in experiments with samples of CMN obtained
    from different sources. They are in agreement to ± 0.2 mK with the NPL-75 gas
    thermometry scale above 2.6 K, with the <italic>T<sub>XISU</sub></italic> (1975)
    magnetic thermometry scale down to 1.3 K and with each other down to 1 K. There
    are appreciable differences between the two scales below 1 K for an unidentified
    reason. The scales are retained in terms of calibrations of 5 rhodium-iron resistance
    thermometers which also carry NPL-75. Vapour pressure data for <sup>3</sup>He
    and <sup>4</sup>He obtained with these thermometers have contributed to the derivation
    of values for the differences between EPT-76 and the established vapour pressure
    scales, <italic>T</italic><sub>58</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>62</sub>, and
    also are intended for use in the complete revision of <italic>T</italic><sub>58</sub>
    and <italic>T</italic><sub>62</sub> which is envisaged by the Comité Consultatif
    de Thermometrie. The relationships between these various scales and other thermometric
    data in the range 0.5 K to 5.2 K are discussed.</p>"
