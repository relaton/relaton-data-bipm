abstract:
- content: "<p>A single-crystal cerous magnesium nitrate (CMN) paramagnetic salt thermometer
    has been set up and used for therometry between 0.4 K and 3.1 K in a cryostat
    also equipped for the measurement of the vapour pressures of<sup>3</sup>He and<sup>4</sup>He.
    Two temperature scales, T<sub>X 1</sub> and T<sub>X 2</sub>, have been derived
    in experiments with samples of CMN obtained from different sources. They are in
    agreement to ± 0.2 mK with the NPL-75 gas thermometry scale above 2.6 K, with
    the T<sub>XISU</sub> (1975) magnetic thermometry scale down to 1.3 K and with
    each other down to 1 K. There are appreciable differences between the two scales
    below 1 K for an unidentified reason. The scales are retained in terms of calibrations
    of 5 rhodium-iron resistance thermometers which also carry NPL-75. Vapour pressure
    data for<sup>3</sup>He and<sup>4</sup>He obtained with these thermometers have
    contributed to the derivation of values for the differences between EPT-76 and
    the established vapour pressure scales, T<sub>58</sub> and T<sub>62</sub>, and
    also are intended for use in the complete revision of T<sub>58</sub> and T<sub>62</sub>
    which is envisaged by the Comité Consultatif de Thermometrie. The relationships
    between these various scales and other thermometric data in the range 0.5 K to
    5.2 K are discussed.</p>"
