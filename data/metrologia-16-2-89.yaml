  content: "<p>In present international and national standards for the measurement
    of specular gloss the primary and secondary reference standards are defined for
    monochromatic radiation. However the glossmeter specified is using polychromatic
    radiation (CIE Standard Illuminant C) and the CIE Standard Photometric Observer.
    This produces errors in practical gloss measurements of up to 0.5%. Although this
    may be considered small as compared to the accuracy of most practical gloss measurements,
    such an error should not be tolerated in the calibration of secondary standards.
    Corrections for such errors are presented and various alternatives for amendments
    of the existing documentary standards are discussed.</p>"
