  content: "<p>A method for preparing phenoxybenzene in a state of high purity, suitable
    for filling triple-point cells, has been devised. Techniques for realizing the
    triple point of phenoxybenzene have been investigated, with a view to achieving
    a week's service from a single realization and good temperature repeatability
    from replicate realizations. The triple-point temperature afforded by one particular
    cell has been monitored for two years. To check on the reproducibility of realization
    and measurement of triple-point temperatures, thirteen cells have been studied
    in two separate laboratories within NPL. The excellent temperature stability of
    NPL's cells and the ease and speed with which the triple point may be realized
    make the phenoxybenzene triple point an attractive secondary reference point for
    those concerned with accurate measurement of temperatures near the ambient. Special
    experiments to determine the residual impurity content have been carried out on
    the cell giving the highest value of triple-point temperature. After allowance
    for the measured impurity content, 2 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup> mole fraction, we propose
    the value 300.020<sub>8</sub> K for the triple-point temperature of completely
    pure phenoxybenzene. Experiments of lesser accuracy lead us to propose the value
    300.029 K for the freezing point of chemically pure phenoxybenzene when saturated
    with dry air at a pressure of 101.325 kPa.</p>"
