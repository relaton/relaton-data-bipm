  content: "<p>The effect of Pt oxidation on the electrical resistance of four different
    Pt resistance thermometers is investigated. It is shown that this process can
    cause large, undesirable resistance changes in these thermometers in spite of
    the low partial pressures of oxygen contained within them. Two different types
    of Pt oxide are identified; both have their temperature ranges for formation and
    dissociation within the official operating range of these thermometers on the
    International Practical Temperature Scale. Changes in the resistance at 0 °C due
    to the formation of Pt0<sub>2</sub> can be as large as 9 milliohms, which could
    cause temperature errors of up to 0.3 °C under some conditions. The rates of resistance
    change due to oxidation are found to depend strongly on the particular Pt sensor
    in each thermometer, the operating temperature, and the amount of Pt oxide initially
    present on the sensor. For the 0 °C resistance these rates can vary from 0 up
    to as high as 109 microhms per hour. Specific procedures, which greatly reduce
    the possible temperature errors from this source, are recommended.</p>"
