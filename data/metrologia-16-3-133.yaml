  content: "<p>We discuss the biased frequency variances or weights of clocks estimated
    from clock data referred to the ensemble time which is determined from an ensemble
    of the clocks without using a primary frequency standard, and show a calculation
    method to obtain the unbiased variances or weights by compensating for the biased
    variances. The method uses an atomic time scale algorithm based on a simply weighted
    average over the ensemble clocks, used only for the unbiased-variance calculation.
    Effects of frequency drifts on the calculation and weight corrections on an atomic
    time scale are also discussed. By computer simulations which use mixed processes
    of white-noise FM and flicker-noise FM the great effectiveness of the unbiased
    variance calculation is shown. An example of a time scale using six clock models
    are also shown by the simulation with an algorithm based on the time-error prediction
    for each clock between intervals without using a primary standard, in which the
    unbiased weights are adopted.</p>"
