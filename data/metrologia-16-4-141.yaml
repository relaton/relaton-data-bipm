abstract:
- content: "<p>Under the auspices of the BIPM the national laboratories of Australia,
    the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Sweden, Hungary and the UK have completed
    an international intercomparison of low attenuation in R 100 waveguide at a frequency
    of 10 GHz. A description of the measuring devices and transfer standards is given.
    All measurement results, which are acceptable for the intercomparison, are represented
    in one diagram and 6 tables. Some formulas for an interpretation of the results
    are presented and a detailed discussion follows.</p>"
