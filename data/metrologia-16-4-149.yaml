abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method of high-precision isotherm thermometry has been developed
    in which the density of helium gas is determined from dielectric constant measurements
    using the virial expansion of the Clausius-Mossotti equation. The technique is
    shown to be accurate at the level of similar 0.3 mK for the range 4.2-27.1 K,
    with potential for both increased accuracy and increased range. The results confirm
    that the gas thermometer scale NPL-75 is internally consistent to better than
    1 mK, and that Berry's recent values for the second virial coefficient of helium
    are correct at the level similar ± 0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>. The results
    also give a value for the third virial coefficient, C(T) = (5420 ± 225)/T cm<sup>6</sup>
    mol<sup>-2</sup>, and a value of 517.257 ± 0.025 × 10<sup>-3</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>
    mol<sup>-1</sup> for the polarizability of<sup>4</sup>He.</p>"
