  content: "<p>In the build-up calibration of precise coaxial ac-dc thermal voltage
    converters, separate thermal converter and multiplier modules are combined and
    intercompared. For routine calibration or testing to specification, ac-dc transfer
    errors associated with the thermal converter modules can usually be neglected.
    However, for the calibration of standards to the highest accuracy, where the uncertainty
    may be &lt; 5 ppm at frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 kHz, thermal converter
    errors must be included. An expression is derived for ac-dc transfer error in
    a thermal converter-multiplier combination. Multiplier transfer error is subject
    to loading effects by the thermal converter module, and the sensitivity of multiplier
    transfer error to changes in converter loading is assessed. Experimental results
    are presented to demonstrate the contribution of thermal converter voltage and
    current transfer errors to the error of the combination.</p>"
