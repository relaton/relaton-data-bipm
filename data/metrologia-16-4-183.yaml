    <p>The Second International Conference on Precision Measurement and Fundamental Constants will be held 8–12 June 1981 at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), Gaithersburg, Maryland. This Conference will be similar to that held at NBS Gaithersburg in August 1970: It will provide an international forum for those engaged in experimental and theoretical research on precision measurements relating to the fundamental physical constants, and on the testing of related fundamental theory. The topics of interest include:<p>High accuracy mass measurements and the kilogram</p><p>Absolute realizations of the basic electric units</p><p>Frequency and time standards</p><p>Frequency measurements of optical radiation, the speed of light and the unit of length</p><p>Faraday and Avogadro constants</p><p>Proton gyromagnetic ratio</p><p>Proton magnetic moment in Bohr and nuclear magnetons</p><p>Fine and hyperfine structure in simple atoms such as hydrogen, muonium, positronium and helium</p><p>Rydberg constant</p><p>Proton to electron mass ratio</p><p>Lepton magnetic moment anomalies</p><p>Fine-Structure constant</p><p>High precision tests of QED</p><p>Newtonian gravitational constant and gravitational acceleration</p><p>Eötvös experiments, anisotropy of space, high precision tests of relativity</p><p>Gas and Stefan-Boltzmann constants</p><p>Time variation of the constants</p><p>Assignment of uncertainties to determinations of constants</p><p>Lease-squares adjustments of the constants.</p>

    It is expected that new results reported at the Conference will be considered for inclusion in the next least-squares adjustment of the constants which is being carried out under the auspices of the CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants. This adjustment should be completed by the end of 1981 and the resulting set of recommended values officially adopted for international use by CODATA in early 1982.</p><p>Those interested in the Conference should communicate with Dr B N Taylor, National Bureau of Standards, Building 220, Room B 258, Washington, DC 20234, USA.</p>
