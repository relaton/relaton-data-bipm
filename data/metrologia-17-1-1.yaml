    <p><italic>Metrologia</italic> was sponsored by, and since its first appearance in 1965 has been published under the auspices of, the International Committee of Weights and Measures. It is thus highly appropriate that its editorial offices will henceforth be located in the laboratories of the International Bureau of Weights &amp; Measures at SÃ¨vres. It is also particularly gratifying to me that it has been able to acquire an editor having the long and distinguished experience in Metrology possessed by Dr R P Hudson, formerly of the National Bureau of Standards.</p>
    <p>This issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> is the first to appear under the editorship of Dr Hudson. The mechanics of publishing are such, however, that the articles in this issue have been (but are the last to be) processed from the Canadian editorial office, so that any errors or omissions are mine.</p>
    <p>I would like to record my very great appreciation for the support I have received from the many contributors to  <italic>Metrologia</italic> during the past twelve years, and also, and particularly, for the work of the members of the editorial board. I wish Dr Hudson the very best success, and a like support from his colleagues.</p>
