  content: "<p>The use of laser beams for the calibration of one radiometer against
    another presents certain problems due to the gaussian intensity profile and coherence
    of such beams. The errors introduced by a decentering of the radiometers with
    respect to each other or with respect to the gaussian laser beams are analyzed
    in detail. The calibration of radiometers for irradiance measurements is of special
    importance in radiometry; the formulae required for making such calibrations are
    given, and the influence on the measurement accuracy of certain factors such as
    radiometer surface uniformity, relative radiometer aperture sizes, and gaussian
    beam waist diameter, are discussed. Internal reflections in radiometer windows
    can cause problems due to the coherence of laser beams. These problems are shown
    to be potentially more serious with large diameter beams than with small diameter
    beams. However, it is shown that, in either case, the inclusion of a very small
    wedge angle in the window (0.1Â° typically) is usually sufficient to eliminate
    such problems.</p>"
