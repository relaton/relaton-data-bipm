  content: "<p>The participants in the intercomparison were National Research Council,
    (Ottawa, Canada) acting as pilot laboratory, National Bureau of Standards (Boulder,
    USA), Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (Malvern, UK), and Electrotechnical
    Laboratory (Tokyo, Japan). Three waveguide thermistor mounts were built at NRC
    for use as transfer standards. The waveguide flanges were made thick for mechanical
    strength and to reduce uncertainties associated with loss at the interface between
    thermistor mounts and calorimeter. Effective efficiencies were measured at 34.5
    and 35.0 GHz. The comparison sequence was NRC-NBS-NRC-RSRE-NRC-ETL-NRC. Measurements
    were begun in October 1974 and completed in October 1978.</p>"
