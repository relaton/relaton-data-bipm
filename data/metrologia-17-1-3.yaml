  content: "<p>Two portable methane-stabilized lasers designed at BIPM have been compared
    with a type a stationary Soviet device developed in VNIIFTRI<sup>1</sup>. This
    comparison is one of a series aimed at establishing the coherence of laser wavelength
    and frequency measurements throughout the world and took place in June 1979. The
    VNIIFTRI and BIPM lasers using different methods of stabilization, have different
    optical and mechanical designs and laser tubes. The results of previous measurements,
    made in VNIIFTRI, of the most important frequency shifts for Soviet lasers together
    with a method of reproducing their frequency which leads to a precision of 1.10<sup>-12</sup>
    are also presented.</p>"
