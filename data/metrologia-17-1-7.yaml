abstract:
- content: "<p>After a brief review of the theory of the reciprocity calibration of
    capacitor microphones in couplers, the paper describes uncommon features of the
    method as practised at CSIRO Division of Applied Physics. Reciprocity calibration
    requires the measurement of an electrical transfer impedance and of an acoustical
    admittance coupling the microphones. The paper describes an electrical bridge
    network using inductive dividers for carrying out the first measurement and then
    goes on to describe a unique coupler in which three microphones forming a reference
    group may be rapidly calibrated with the interchange of electrical connections
    only. Experimental data are given showing comparative results obtained with this
    coupler and the two designs recommended by the I.E.C.</p>"
