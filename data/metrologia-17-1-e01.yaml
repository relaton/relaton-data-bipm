abstract:
- content: "<p>Metrologia was sponsored by, and since its first appearance in 1965
    has been published under the auspices of, the International Committee of Weights
    and Measures. It is thus highly appropriate that its editorial offices will henceforth
    be located in the laboratories of the International Bureau of Weights &amp; Measures
    at SÃ¨vres. It is also particularly gratifying to me that it has been able to acquire
    an editor having the long and distinguished experience in Metrology possessed
    by Dr R P Hudson, formerly of the National Bureau of Standards.</p><p>This issue
    of  Metrologia is the first to appear under the editorship of Dr Hudson. The mechanics
    of publishing are such, however, that the articles in this issue have been (but
    are the last to be) processed from the Canadian editorial office, so that any
    errors or omissions are mine.</p><p>I would like to record my very great appreciation
    for the support I have received from the many contributors to  Metrologia during
    the past twelve years, and also, and particularly, for the work of the members
    of the editorial board. I wish Dr Hudson the very best success, and a like support
    from his colleagues.</p>"
