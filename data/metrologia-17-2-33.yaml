abstract:
- content: "<p>As the new Editor of Metrologia, I welcome this opportunity to greet
    the readers, to say a few words on hopes and plans, and to make both a plea and
    promise. The plea arises from a perception that, despite its sixteen years of
    existence, this journal does not yet enjoy a status of intimate familiarity throughout
    the world community of physicists. Nevertheless, having been established as a
    vehicle for disseminating knowledge on all matters metrological, it offers a unique
    communication and archival resource to those who are active in advancing the science
    (and the art) of accurate measurement. Therefore I beseech all readers to lose
    no opportunity to submit their finest metrology research reports and their most
    penetrating metrological ruminations for publication here and—highly important—to
    encourage their unaware colleagues to do likewise. And, as a journal cannot flourish
    which is not fully responsive to the needs of its clientele, my promise is to
    bend every effort to achieving prompt and careful review of your submissions and
    rapid publication for those accepted.</p><p>It is my hope and intention, furthermore,
    to bring about a measure of increased variety of content through occasional seminal
    review articles, news of major publications and forthcoming conferences, news
    of current research and development that should be of major interest to the readership
    well before the publication of its results; and through the inclusion of short
    communications on research, letters and topics of wide interest, and comments
    on articles published. In order to successfully promote these aims, your specific
    contributions and your suggestions for improvements are enthusiastically solicited.
    Finally, let me record my gratitude to the distinguished scientists who have agreed
    to serve for a term on the Editorial Board, to assist me in my task and to labour
    in the interests of you all. Each member of that Board stands ready to assist
    the readership on any matter pertaining to publication in Metrologia.</p>"
