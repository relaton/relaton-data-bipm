    <p>As the new Editor of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>, I welcome this opportunity to greet the readers, to say a few words on hopes and plans, and to make both a plea and promise. The plea arises from a perception that, despite its sixteen years of existence, this journal does not yet enjoy a status of intimate familiarity throughout the world community of physicists. Nevertheless, having been established as a vehicle for disseminating knowledge on all matters metrological, it offers a unique communication and archival resource to those who are active in advancing the science (and the art) of accurate measurement. Therefore I beseech all readers to lose no opportunity to submit their finest metrology research reports and their most penetrating metrological ruminations for publication here and—highly important—to encourage their unaware colleagues to do likewise. And, as a journal cannot flourish which is not fully responsive to the needs of its clientele, my promise is to bend every effort to achieving prompt and careful review of your submissions and rapid publication for those accepted.</p>
    <p>It is my hope and intention, furthermore, to bring about a measure of increased variety of content through occasional seminal review articles, news of major publications and forthcoming conferences, news of current research and development that should be of major interest to the readership well before the publication of its results; and through the inclusion of short communications on research, letters and topics of wide interest, and comments on articles published. In order to successfully promote these aims, your specific contributions and your suggestions for improvements are enthusiastically solicited. Finally, let me record my gratitude to the distinguished scientists who have agreed to serve for a term on the Editorial Board, to assist me in my task and to labour in the interests of you all. Each member of that Board stands ready to assist the readership on any matter pertaining to publication in  <italic>Metrologia</italic>.
    </p>
