abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of the triple point of gases as a method for obtaining highly
    reproducible pressure fixed points is described. In order to obtain pressure transfer
    standards, the method is implemented with transportable, self-contained sealed
    cells, containing the sample of gas, which can be easily shipped around for intercomparisons
    in the pressure range 0.1 to 100 kPa. Experimental results on these devices are
    reported for three gases, including also their absolute pressure value. Oxygen:
    p = 146.25 ± 0.3 Pa, T = 54.3610 K, reproducibility of the transfer standard:
    ±0.1 Pa; methane: p = 11 696 ± 2 Pa, T = 90.6856 K, reproducibility: ±0.7 Pa;
    argon: p = 68 890 ± 1.5 Pa, T = 83.7980 K, reproducibility: ±1 Pa. The temperature
    of the normal boiling point of argon was also measured and found to be 87.295<sub>2</sub>
    ± 0.0005 K. All temperatures are given in IPTS-68, realized with the triple point
    of argon.</p>"
