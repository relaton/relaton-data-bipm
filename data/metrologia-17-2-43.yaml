abstract:
- content: "<p>The interpolation process used to determine the value of temperatures,
    other than the defining fixed points, measured by means of platinum resistance
    thermometers on the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 is unsatisfactory
    for a number of reasons. It is awkward and tedious to use, requiring a lengthy
    iterative computer program to determine the temperature. It is discontinuous.
    Errors made at one calibration point are reflected in all lower temperature intervals
    and it is not unique.</p><p>This paper summarizes previous attempts to overcome
    these problems, comments on their advantages and shortcomings and gives a number
    of improved schemes. These are treated from the point of view of uniqueness, insensitivity
    to calibration errors and the possibility of using only part of the scale. The
    reasons for choosing a particular method are discussed.</p>"
