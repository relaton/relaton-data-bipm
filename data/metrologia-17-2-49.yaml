abstract:
- content: "<p>The temperature T measured with an optical pyrometer results from the
    solution of an integral equation that contains the spectral transmittance of the
    optical components τ(λ) and the relative spectral sensitivity of the detector
    V(λ). Their values as measured at a discrete set of wavelengths are τ (λ<sub>i</sub>)
    ± Δ τ (λ<sub>i</sub>), i = 1, 2, 3,..., N, and V(λ<sub>k</sub>) ± Δ V(λ<sub>k</sub>),
    k = 1, 2, 3,..., M. where Δτ(λ<sub>i</sub>) and ΔV(λ<sub>k</sub>) are the corresponding
    measurement uncertainties.</p><p>A numerical procedure is presented to calculate
    the temperature for each measured value of the pyrometer's signal by solving numerically
    the above-mentioned integral equation, avoiding the introduction of unnecessary
    approximations. Assuming that the experimental errors at each wavelength are statistically
    independent, we have derived an equation to calculat ethe temperature uncertainty
    arising from the random uncertainty of the measured spectral data. As an aid in
    evaluating both the quality of the measured data and the uncertainties in the
    numerical procedure, flexible and realistic analytic expressions for τ(λ) and
    V(λ) have been constructed which lead to an exact algebraic solution of the integral
    equation.</p>"
