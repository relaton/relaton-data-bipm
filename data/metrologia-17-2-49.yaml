    <p>The temperature <italic>T</italic> measured with an optical pyrometer results from the solution of an integral equation that contains the spectral transmittance of the optical components τ(λ) and the relative spectral sensitivity of the detector <italic>V</italic>(λ). Their values as measured at a discrete set of wavelengths are τ (λ<sub>i</sub>) ± Δ τ (λ<sub>i</sub>), i = 1, 2, 3,..., N, and <italic>V</italic>(λ<sub>k</sub>) ± Δ <italic>V</italic>(λ<sub>k</sub>), k = 1, 2, 3,..., M. where Δτ(λ<sub>i</sub>) and Δ<italic>V</italic>(λ<sub>k</sub>) are the corresponding measurement uncertainties.</p>
    <p>A numerical procedure is presented to calculate the temperature for each measured value of the pyrometer's signal by solving numerically the above-mentioned integral equation, avoiding the introduction of unnecessary approximations. Assuming that the experimental errors at each wavelength are statistically independent, we have derived an equation to calculat ethe temperature uncertainty arising from the random uncertainty of the measured spectral data. As an aid in evaluating both the quality of the measured data and the uncertainties in the numerical procedure, flexible and realistic analytic expressions for τ(λ) and <italic>V</italic>(λ) have been constructed which lead to an exact algebraic solution of the integral equation.</p>
