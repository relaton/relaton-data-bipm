abstract:
- content: "<p>In the present investigation, the integral equation for the temperature
    distribution inside the cavity at the gold freezing point, and the relation between
    the emissivity and the local temperature have been derived according to the basic
    ideas of Geist. In addition, we have calculated the changes of the temperature
    and emissivity of the bottom of a baffled cylindrical cavity due to the changes
    in the temperature of the baffle. Some typical results are given here.</p>"
