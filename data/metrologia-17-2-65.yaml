abstract:
- content: "<p>The technique of magnetic depolarisation of resonance fluorescence
    has been compared with that of beat-frequency measurement at 633 nm as a method
    for testing the quality of sealed iodine cells. It has been found that the results
    of the two tests correlate well. The repeatability obtainable by the magnetic-depolarisation
    technique is similar to that normally achieved in cell comparison by beat-frequency
    measurement. The former method also verifies the quality of the NPL iodine cells
    by comparison with linewidth measurements made elsewhere.</p>"
