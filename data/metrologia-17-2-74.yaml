    <p>In July 1976, some thirty young scientists and their lecturers were privileged to participate in a conference on "Metrology and the Fundamental Constants" at Varenna, this being the 68th course in the "Enrico Fermi International School of Physics". Now, at last, we are all privileged to share in that experience—to a large degree—with the appearance of the Proceedings, published last summer under the auspices of the Italian Physical Society.</p>
    <p>This rather massive volume (800 pages) places in one's hands a summary of the "state of the art" in the greater part of physical metrology. It is not, however, a metrology handbook, designed to assist the unskilled in making trustworthy measurements. It summarizes, via the lectures of internationally-recognized experts, the most recent attempts to realize with enhanced accuracy the basic units of measurement and, in so doing, it presents the subject of measurement science as the central (or all-pervasive) topic in physics itself. Clearly demonstrated is the progress from discovery to "understanding" of physical phenomena which is made possible through the historical alternation of observation and measurement.</p>
    <p>The volume includes informative reviews of the fundamentals of this fundamental science, namely, the concepts of quantities and units (Allisy); systems of units and the Système International, SI. (Terrien); international aspects of metrology and standards (Terrien); practical considerations in a hierarchy of standards (Terrien); materials problems affecting metrology (Ferro Milone and Sourdo) and statistical methods (Allisy). These discussions alone, being brought together in one place, are of particular usefulness.</p>
    <p>The remaining, and major, part of the book is taken up by authoritative and generally very readable discussions of measurement topics, for the most part separately focused on one of the base units. For these one cannot help noticing nor refrain from recording a measure of imbalance: some quantities (for example, time and frequency) are accorded several lectures and lecturers, while most receive only one each. That choice by the conference's organizers is not explained in the Foreword. But it is not a very serious drawback; nor—for the anglophone reader, at least—is the appearance here and there of quaint inventions in English which, in fact, add to the charm.</p>
    <p>There are short articles on the Determination of Atomic Masses of Nuclides (Wapstra), some Problems in Photometry (Korte); two by A Bray on Force Standards, one dealing with Dissemination and the other with Measurement of "g"; Time Scales (Leschiutta); determining the Volume of a Sphere (Terrien); and two by Giacomo, one commenting on Mass Measurements and one discussing the Speed of Light. Of intermediate length are reviews of the Determination of Best Values of the Fundamental Physical Constants (Cohen); Length Measurement Standards (Giacomo), and Topics in Quantum Electrodynamics (Combley and Picasso).</p>
    <p>The extended treatment of time and frequency metrology includes three major articles by Audoin: a general (largely analytical) one on Frequency Metrology, followed by detailed discussions of Cesium Beam and Hydrogen Maser technology. There are, in addition, specialized treatments of Optically-Pumped Microwave Devices (Arditi) and of Optical Frequency Standards (i.e., lasers) by Chebotayev; finally, a brief note by De Marchi on Problems in Frequency Synthesis in the far Infrared Region. A long article by Petley covers the many-faceted subject of Electrical Metrology and the Fundamental Constants. Equally variegated, although belied by its simple title, is a discussion of Thermometry by Quinn. And last, but not least, is a detailed account by Deslattes of his determination of Avogadro's Constant which ranges over the topics of Infrared to Gamma-ray Reference Wavelengths, Mass and Density.</p>
    <p>In summarizing it is difficult to avoid the assertion, however hackneyed, that no physicist can afford to be without—or, at least, do without reading—a copy of these Proceedings.</p>
