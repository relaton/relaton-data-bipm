    <p>The Third Symposium on Frequency Standards and Metrology will be held 5–7 October 1981 at the Centre Paul Langevin, Aussois, Savoie, France. This Conference will follow the lines of its predecessors at Forêt Montmorency, Quebec, Canada in September 1971 and at Copper Mountain, Colorado, USA in July 1976. It is intended to serve as a discussion forum on recent progress and ideas relating to precision frequency standards, the associated metrology and the specific fields of applications.</p><p>A tentative list of the topics to be covered is the following:<list list-type="unordered"><list-item><p>Progress in the field of atomic/molecular frequency standards throughout the electromagnetic spectrum</p></list-item><list-item><p>Current trends and discussion of the precision capabilities of new techniques (Ramsey fringes in optics, cooling of atoms and ions... )</p></list-item><list-item><p>System application (VLBI, navigation...) and scientific applications (relativity, geodesy...) of atomic/molecular frequency standards and needs in these fields</p></list-item><list-item><p>Modern distant time and frequency comparisons</p></list-item><list-item><p>Progress in frequency synthesis of microwave to visible frequencies, etc.</p></list-item></list>
    Most of the talks will be by invitation. Time will be provided for discussion, as well as for presentation of selected late ideas and results.</p><p>Those interested in the Symposium should communicate with: Dr C Audoin, Laboratoire de l'Horloge Atomique,
    Bât. 221, Université Paris-Sud, 91405 Orsay Cedex, France.</p>
