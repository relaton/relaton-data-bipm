abstract:
- content: "<p>The main problem in the application of radiation pyrometry to the measurement
    of true surface temperatures is the large error arising from the unknown or varying
    emissivity of the surface. The nature of the additional information required for
    the class of techniques which utilize only the thermal radiation emitted from
    the surface is discussed. The suggestions that multi-wavelength pyrometry, requiring
    measurements at many different wavelengths, may be employed to solve the problem
    without additional information are analyzed, and shown to possess distinct disadvantages.</p>"
