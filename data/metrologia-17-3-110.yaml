- content: "<p>The call for papers for the 6th Symposium on Temperature, Its Measurement
    and Control in Science and Industry has been issued. The Symposium is scheduled
    to take place in Washington, DC, USA during the week of March 14â€“18, 1982. Like
    its predecessors held in the years 1919, 1939, 1954, 1961, and 1971, the 6th Symposium
    will stress advances in the measurement of thermodynamic values of temperature,
    in temperature reference points, in temperature sensors and instruments for the
    control of temperature, and in the development and use of temperature scales.
    For the first time, an exhibit of thermometry will be a part of the Symposium.</p><p>Manuscripts
    to be submitted for inclusion in the Symposium should be sent to the 6th Temperature
    Symposium Program Chairman, National Bureau of Standards, by September 15, 1981.
    Those papers accepted for the Symposium will be due in camera-ready form by February
    15, 1982. Original papers on all of the topics listed above, as well as reviews
    of the past decade's progress in thermometry and temperature control, are solicited
    by the Symposium organizers.</p><p>The Symposium arrangements and registration
    are in the care of the Instrument Society of America (represented on the Symposium
    General Committee by Mr C T Glazer, 67 Alexander Drive, PO Box 12277, Research
    Triangle Park, North Carolina, 27709, USA). Questions regarding the instrument
    exhibits should also be addressed to the ISA. The technical program for the Symposium
    is the responsibility of a committee headed by Dr J F Schooley, Room B-128 Physics
    Building, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC, 20234, USA. The Symposium
    proceedings will be published by the American Institute of Physics.</p>"
