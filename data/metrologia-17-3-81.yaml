abstract:
- content: "<p>From June 18 to 24, 1979 at VNIIM comparisons were made of He-Ne/<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    lasers belonging to VNIIM* and BIPM.</p><p>Frequency separations of the hyperfine
    components d, e, f, g of the R(127) line of iodine were measured and investigations
    carried out of the influence of amplitude modulation and the pressure of iodine,
    and of the power shifts. The frequency separations of d, e, f, g components were
    also measured for the VNIIM stabilized laser, using a BIPM servo loop. Lasers
    VNIIM7, VNIIM1, BIPM3 and BIPM6 were used.</p><p>This comparison was interesting
    because the optical and mechanical designs, iodine cells and laser tubes were
    completely different. It is the second comparison between VNIIM and BIPM. It is
    also a part of a series of international comparisons between national laboratories
    and BIPM aimed at improving the coherence of laser wavelength and frequency measurements
    throughout the world.</p><p>VNIIM lasers have the following parameters: the distance
    between the mirrors is 31 cm; the flat mirror, which is located near the iodine
    cell, has a reflectivity of 99 percent; the other one has a radius of curvature
    of 1.2 m and a maximum reflectivity.</p>"
