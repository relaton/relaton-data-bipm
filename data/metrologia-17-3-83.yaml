abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate knowledge of the value of the proton gyromagnetic ratio γ́<sub>p</sub>
    is of great interest due to its role in the determination of the value of the
    fine structure constant. In this paper, a new technique for the determination
    of γ́<sub>p</sub> is proposed which employs the Ramsey separated oscillatory field
    magnetic resonance technique using flowing water. Systematic effects and possible
    sources of error are discussed. The method may be capable of an accuracy of a
    few parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. This would provide an order of magnitude reduction
    in the uncertainty in α.</p>"
