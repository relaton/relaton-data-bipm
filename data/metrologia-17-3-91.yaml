abstract:
- content: "<p>The existence of a significant degree of correlation between fluctuations
    in the time of arrival of a Loran C signal and temperature variations at the receiving
    laboratory is demonstrated experimentally. These fluctuations, with periods from
    several days to a year, appear to constitute an important factor limiting the
    precision of international time-scale comparisons based on Loran C measurements,
    and hence both the stability and accuracy of the International Atomic Time scale
    at present constructed by means of these measurements.</p>"
