  content: "<p>A 45°/normal reflectometer has been constructed and tested for calibrating
    the absolute reflectance factor of diffuse samples over the 380-770 nm spectral
    range using polarized radiation. The measurement equations have been derived for
    the method used. The method using a step-down technique and view factor calls
    for the measurements of the ratio of two fluxes and, in addition, some linear
    dimensions. The uniformity of the receiver system is achieved by means of a double-sphere
    signal averager. Uncertainties of the absolute-reflectance-factor measurements
    obtained with this system are estimated to be ±0.3% of the measured value. For
    all the samples that have been tested, the 45°/normal reflectance factor was found
    to be higher than the 6°/hemispherical reflectance factor. The higher reflectance
    values for 45°/normal geometry were confirmed by additional gonioreflectometer
    measurements.</p>"
