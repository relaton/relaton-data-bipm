abstract:
- content: "<p>Three primary cesium clocks with a one-metre microwave interaction
    length have been constructed at the National Research Council of Canada. Based
    on a design similar to that of CsV, the 2.1 m NRC primary cesium clock, they have
    bi-directional beam capability, a resonance line width of about 100 Hz, and embody
    improvements to the cesium ovens, detectors, and dipole magnetic-state selectors
    which lead to a lifetime, estimated from cesium consumption, of about 25 years.
    In operation as secondary clocks from late 1978 until December 1979, and subsequently
    as primary clocks, they provide an accuracy and stability comparable to those
    of CsV. Long-term frequency stability is better than 1 × 10<sup>-14</sup>, and
    short-term frequency stability at beam currents normally used for continuous clock
    operation of about 2.5 to 3 pA is about 1 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for 1000 s averaging
    time. The limit of error, estimated from two complete accuracy evaluations, one
    performed in late 1979 and the second early in 1981, is about 1.5 × 10<sup>-13</sup>.
    The frequencies of the three clocks, CsVIA, CsVIB, and CsVIC, remained within
    2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> of that of CsV during their first year and a half of operation
    as primary clocks, and within 5 × 10<sup>-14</sup> during the final part of this
    period subsequent to a number of improvements made to certain of the electronics
    systems.</p>"
