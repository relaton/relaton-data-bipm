    <p>Ac-dc transfer is examined in the presence of a dc reversal difference. It is shown that the definition of ac-dc difference normally used by standards laboratories leads to a systematic error which is of concern in establishing primary standards. An expression is derived for this error and it is shown that it can be eliminated by use of an alternative definition.</p>
    <p>Using the derived expression, errors for single-junction thermal converters are investigated. Calculations, based on data given by one manufacturer, for currents over the range 20% to 120% of rated, indicate that the systematic error may be in excess of 4 ppm for a reversal difference of about 0.05% and possibly as high as 70 ppm for a reversal difference of 0.2%.</p>
    <p>Experimental data for reversal difference as a function of current are presented for eleven thermal converters, some with Evanohm and some with Nichrome heaters, and with current ratings (<italic>I</italic><sub>r</sub>) ranging from 2.5 to 15 mA. Systematic errors arising from the definition are evaluated for each converter. For those converters in the group with reversal differences of less than 0.05% at rated current the systematic errors are found to be less than 0.1 ppm for 0.2 ⩽ <italic>I/I</italic><sub>r</sub> ⩽ 1.2.</p>
