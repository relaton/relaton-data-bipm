  content: "<p>Precise measurements of the sensitivity of capacitor microphones are
    universally made by a reciprocity procedure using closed couplers. Such measurements
    are carried out at relatively low sound pressure levels, however, and the present
    paper describes an investigation of the accuracy with which the sensitivity calibration
    is maintained at higher levels. It is concluded that, for a well-known type of
    microphone, changes in sensitivity for sound pressure levels up to 110 dB are
    insignificant.</p>"
