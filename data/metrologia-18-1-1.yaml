abstract:
- content: <p>Properties of the quantity "plane angle" are explored under the hypothesis
    that it is a dimensional quantity. The exploration proceeds especially with respect
    to the physical concept, its mathematical treatment, vector concepts, measurement
    theory, units of related quantities, engineering pragmatism, and SI. An attempt
    is made to bring these different relations into a rational, logical and consistent
    framework, and thus to justify the hypothesis.</p><p>Various types of vectorial
    quantities are recognized, and their properties described with an outline of the
    necessary algebraic manipulations. The concept of plane angle is amplified, and
    its interdependence with the circular arc is explored. The resulting units of
    plane angle form a class of similar scales of measurement. Consequences of the
    confirmed hypothesis are developed for mathematical expressions involving trigonometric
    functions, rotational volumes and areas, mathematical limits, differentiation
    and series expansion.</p><p>Consequences for mechanical rotational quantities
    are developed, with proposals for revisions to a number of expressions for derived
    units within SI. A revised definition for the quantity "plane angle" is stated
    to take account of the developed insights. There is a clear need to reconsider
    the status of plane angle and some other quantities within the international framework
    of SI.</p>
