  content: "<p>New primary cesium standards to be operated as primary clocks are under
    construction at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). Design aspects
    are presented: The standards will operate with the beam reversal method in a vertical
    position and with a beam velocity of about 90 m/s or less. Many design features
    are similar to those of the primary standard CS1 of the PTB put into operation
    in 1969 and used as a primary clock since 1978. The new standards will be equipped
    with a new type of beam optics using a two-dimensional beam-deflection system
    exclusively allowing the atoms in the desired state (<italic>F</italic> = 4, <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub>
    = 0) to be focused on a central flop-out detector. The adjacent transitions are
    suppressed.</p>"
