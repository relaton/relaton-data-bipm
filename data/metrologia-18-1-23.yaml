abstract:
- content: "<p>The design, operation and performance of a precision photoelectric
    pyrometer, which operates automatically under computer control, are described.
    Methods of determining the spectral characteristics, the size-of-source effect,
    the degree of polarization and the nonlinearity are described and results given.
    A table of uncertainties shows that the pyrometer has the capability of realizing
    the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 with uncertainties of 0.015
    °C at 1064 °C and 0.210 °C at 2241 °C. However with the limitation caused by tungsten
    strip lamps these uncertainties become 0.025 °C at 1064 °C and 0.75 °C at 2241
    °C.</p>"
