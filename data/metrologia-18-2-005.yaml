abstract:
- content: "<p>The recent proton to electron mass ratio determination of Van Dyck
    and Schwinberg can be combined with earlier measurements of Greene et al to obtain
    a more accurate value of the neutron magnetic moment expressed in nuclear magnetons.
    We find μ<sub>n</sub>/μ<sub>N</sub> = 1.91304308 (54) (0.28 ppm).</p>"
