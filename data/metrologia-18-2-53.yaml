  content: "<p>The frequency shifts of a <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized He-Ne
    laser at 633 nm wavelength induced by changing the iodine pressure between 0.8
    and 17 Pa inside an absorption cell are investigated at different amplitudes of
    modulation. The results show the well-known linear pressure shifts between 5 and
    17 Pa, but also non-linear pressure shifts between 0.8 and 5 Pa, dependent upon
    the amplitude of modulation and the hyperfine structure (HFS) component. These
    shifts show a different behaviour for two iodine cells, one of which apparently
    contains a certain amount of impurities. Possible causes for the non-linear frequency-pressure
    dependence are discussed. The results obtained with the contaminated iodine cell
    can be explained by supposing that the condensation point is reached of a second
    gas present inside the cell.</p>"
