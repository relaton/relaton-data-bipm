abstract:
- content: <p>A passive microwave caesium beam resonator using optical pumping and
    optical detection, with a C.W. tunable GaAs diode laser, has been realized. The
    "0-0 clock transition" is detected through a change in the intensity of the fluorescence
    of the caesium beam. Experimental recordings of the Ramsey pattern agree with
    a Maxwellian distribution of atomic velocities. Results of preliminary tests,
    to an accuracy of a few parts in 10<sup>11</sup>, show good potentialities for
    a frequency standard of higher accuracy.</p>
