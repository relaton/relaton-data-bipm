abstract:
- content: "<p>The neutron source measurement service was established in 1960, based
    on absolute measurements in a flow-type manganese sulphate bath system, the hydrogen/manganese
    cross-section ratio having been determined in a dilution experiment. As a result
    of improvements in chemical analysis of trace elements in the bath solution and
    in computerized data fitting techniques over this 20-year period, it is possible
    to re-evaluate the emission rates of neutron sources which have been measured
    during this period.</p><p>The re-evaluation demonstrates that the emission rates
    should be increased by 0.5% mainly due to neutron absorption in traces of boron,
    cadmium and lithium.</p><p>The manganese sulphate solution has now been replaced
    by purer material, and the re-measurement of the cross-section ratio is in progress.</p>"
