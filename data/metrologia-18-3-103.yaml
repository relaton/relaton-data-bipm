  content: "<p>Velocity-related problems like Doppler shifts, distributed cavity phase-shift
    and pulling by neighbouring transitions are presently the limiting factors in
    the accuracy of Cs beam primary frequency standards. The use of slow atoms appears
    to be the only fundamental solution to these problems, and new kinds of standards
    are being investigated, based on different ideas for trapping and cooling down
    the atoms. The thirty-year-old idea of gravitational trapping was abandoned after
    a short trial due to bad signal-to-noise ratio in a Cs fountain beam which made
    use of magnetic state selection and hot wire detection. In this paper it is shown
    that optical state selection and detection, in conjunction with an open Fabry-Perot
    type resonator, can make that old idea very attractive again. A rough design sketch
    is outlined and a detailed analysis is given of the various uncertainty sources
    affecting the frequency of a fountain Cs standard, while problems which need further
    examination are pointed out.</p>"
