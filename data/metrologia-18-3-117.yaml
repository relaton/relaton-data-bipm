  content: "<p>Sources of uncertainty associated with realizing the standard of sound
    pressure using one-inch laboratory-standard microphones calibrated by the closed-coupler
    reciprocity technique are discussed in detail. A measurement technique designed
    to achieve an acceptable level of uncertainty is described and the components
    of systematic and random uncertainties in the range 63 Hz to 12.5 kHz are given.
    With suitable microphones the overall systematic uncertainty of calibration is
    estimated to be less than 0.025 dB at frequencies up to 1 kHz, increasing to 0.11
    dB at 10 kHz.</p>"
