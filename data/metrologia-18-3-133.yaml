  content: "<p>An ac-dc transfer comparator for the precise intercomparison of thermal
    converters (TCs) is described and its circuit analysed for comparisons between
    TCs with both equal and unequal heater currents. Details of its use in ac-dc current-transfer
    measurements and the repeatability achieved for a range of excitation currents
    are given. For similar TCs, the estimated standard deviation of transfer-difference
    measurements is typically &lt; 0.1 ppm at rated current. The estimated standard
    deviation of the mean of repeated sets of 10 measurements at rated current is
    typically similar 0.02 ppm and for sets of 30 measurements at 20% of rated current
    is similar 0.2 ppm.</p>"
