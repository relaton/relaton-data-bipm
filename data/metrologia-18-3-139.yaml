  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A transportable absolute gravimeter has been constructed at the National
    Institute of Metrology (NIM), which is based upon the principle of free fall through
    three stations. A cube-corner reflector dropped in a vacuum chamber forms an arm
    of an optical interferometer. The interference pattern produced by the motion
    of the falling object is converted to an electric signal. This is then processed
    by a special electronics system, so that the distances and the respective time
    intervals of the falling reflector as it passes each of the three stations are
    measured. The light source of the interferometer is a stabilized He-Ne laser.
    The time base is a rubidium frequency standard. The sources of error of the measurement
    and the uncertainty of the results are given. The effect of non-verticality of
    the laser beam is discussed. Some of the recent results including the comparison
    with A. Sakuma's gravimeter at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)
    are presented. The accuracy achieved with this gravimeter is about 2 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup>.</p>"
