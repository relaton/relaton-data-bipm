abstract:
- content: "<p>We have developed a new and portable apparatus for making absolute
    measurements of the acceleration due to the Earth's gravity. We use the method
    of free fall, and interferometrically determine the acceleration of a freely falling
    cube corner. In the design and development of this instrument, particular attention
    was paid to those aspects which would affect its performance in the field. The
    resulting instrument, we believe, provides a viable new tool for the study of
    tectonic motions. The system is very small; it can be transported in a small van
    and requires only two hours for assembly. A high rate of data acquisition is available;
    if necessary, a single measurement can be made every two seconds. Further, we
    have made a concerted effort to detect and (we hope) eliminate systematic errors.
    The results of extensive tests indicate that the achievable accuracy for g is
    about six parts in 10<sup>9</sup>. This instrument therefore provides a sensitivity
    to vertical motions (e.g., of the Earth's crust) as small as 2 cm.</p>"
