abstract:
- content: "<p>Following some theoretical considerations of water adsorption on metal
    surfaces, a description is given of the measuring devices. The mass of the water
    adsorption layer is determined by weighing, with due regard to the following influencing
    parameters: material, roughness, oxide layers and impurities as a function of
    the humidity of air. In addition, results obtained for various metal surfaces
    (coated and uncoated) will be discussed.</p>"
