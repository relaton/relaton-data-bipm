abstract:
- content: "<p>The absolute measurement of the acceleration due to gravity g has long
    been of interest to metrologists and geophysicists and has been the subject of
    a considerable amount of experimental work in national standards laboratories
    and at the BIPM. Far from slackening, interest in such measurements has increased
    in recent years, in particular due to the possible link between small changes
    in g and the occurrence of short-term tectonic movements such as the earth tide
    and earthquakes, as well as longer-term secular variations in the earth's gravity
    field.</p><p>During a recent intercomparison of absolute gravimeters at BIPM,
    it was suggested that a series of articles in Metrologia, perhaps in a special
    issue, would provide a timely review of the present state of absolute gravimetry.
    For various reasons it has proved more practical to abandon the idea of a special
    issue devoted exclusively to gravimetry and instead to publish the articles as
    they become available. We hope, however, that all will appear in the current volume,
    namely volume 18. The first two articles in the series, from NIM, Beijing and
    NBS, Boulder, appear in this issue. In the next we expect to publish articles
    from the BIPM; AEI, Novosibirsk; and IMGC, Turin.</p>"
