    <p>The absolute measurement of the acceleration due to gravity  <italic>g</italic> has long been of interest to metrologists and geophysicists and has been the subject of a considerable amount of experimental work in national standards laboratories and at the BIPM. Far from slackening, interest in such measurements has increased in recent years, in particular due to the possible link between small changes in  <italic>g</italic> and the occurrence of short-term tectonic movements such as the earth tide and earthquakes, as well as longer-term secular variations in the earth's gravity field.</p>
    <p>During a recent intercomparison of absolute gravimeters at BIPM, it was suggested that a series of articles in  <italic>Metrologia</italic>, perhaps in a special issue, would provide a timely review of the present state of absolute gravimetry. For various reasons it has proved more practical to abandon the idea of a special issue devoted exclusively to gravimetry and instead to publish the articles as they become available. We hope, however, that all will appear in the current volume, namely volume 18. The first two articles in the series, from NIM, Beijing and NBS, Boulder, appear in this issue. In the next we expect to publish articles from the BIPM; AEI, Novosibirsk; and IMGC, Turin.</p>
