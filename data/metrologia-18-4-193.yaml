  content: "<p>Novel use has been made of a high-precision, servo-controlled balance
    for the hydrostatic weighing of solid objects. The balance is completely immersed
    in a fluorocarbon fluid. Extensive experience has been gained by using the apparatus
    in the assignment of density to 70 silicon objects which will be issued as a Standard
    Reference Material (SRM). The balance contributes about 1 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup> to
    the relative uncertainty of the final results.</p>"
