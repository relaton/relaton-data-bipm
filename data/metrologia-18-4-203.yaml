abstract:
- content: "<p>A new type of high-temperature platinum resistance thermometer has
    been developed and tested. The thermometer with a strip-shaped support was designed
    in such a special way that the curvature of the platinum wire in a sensor is kept
    almost uniform, and thus the strain in the wire can be reduced to a minimum. The
    experiments, which have lasted for over 3 years, show that the stability of the
    thermometers is excellent. The average change in resistance of the thermometer
    at 0 °C was equivalent to about 1 mK for every 100 h of exposure to temperatures
    from 1070 °C to 1100 °C. The anneal time at 1100 °C required to achieve this stability
    was only 150 h. The changes of R<sub>0</sub> are usually less than 1.0 mK equivalent
    after rapidly cooling from 1064 °C to ambient temperatures, followed by annealing
    at 650 °C for half an hour. The leakage resistance of these thermometers at 1064
    °C is greater than 27 MΩ. It seems that the problem of fused silica devitrification
    can be solved.</p>"
