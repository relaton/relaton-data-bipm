  content: "<p>Decay time constants for magnetically-suspended rotors undergoing inertial
    spin-down have been measured at room temperature. Bearing-rotor interactions have
    been studied and evidence found that there is a driving mechanism capable of accelerating
    or decelerating a rotor with a moment of inertia of ≈1100 g cm<sup>2</sup> at
    the 10<sup>-14</sup> W level. The complicated rotor decay structure suggests that
    there exist unfavorable rotational frequencies at which mode coupling exists and
    leads to unavoidably large levels of angular momentum dissipation. The length
    of the rotors (≈20 cm) also produces a pendulum motion which at times results
    in ambiguities in the spin-down data due to interference with the normal operation
    of the optical-lever timing system.</p>"
