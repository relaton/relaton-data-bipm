abstract:
- content: <p>A brief description is given of the apparatus for absolute gravity acceleration
    measurements that was constructed by the Istituto di Metrologia "G Colonnetti"
    - Torino - in cooperation with the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    The paper supplies information on the use of the gravimeter in the past seven
    years, during which g measurements were made at 52 stations over the world, and
    analyses as well the causes of possible errors in the g measurements, while pointing
    out the methods adopted to eliminate their effects.</p>
