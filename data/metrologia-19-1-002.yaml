abstract:
- content: <p>Properties of the quantity "Solid Angle" are explored under the hypothesis
    that "Plane Angle" is a dimensional quantity, as was proposed in a previous paper.
    This exploration proceeds by considering rotations (plane angles) compounded in
    space.</p><p>It is shown that five degrees of freedom would be sufficient to define
    the location and direction of a line in 3-D space. For the purpose of dimensional
    analysis, it is shown that the relationship between Plane and Solid Angles can
    be expressed as {A<sup>2</sup>} = {SA}, but it is also shown that this relationship
    cannot be applied directly to the existing units of plane and solid angles.</p><p>The
    relationships of Plane Angles to the generation of areas on spherical surfaces,
    particularly those of spherical triangles, are presented, and brought into the
    context of the definitions of units of solid angle, especially that of the SI
    unit, the Steradian. Two special conditions are presented under which Solid Angle
    and Plane Angle are by coincidence directly proportional, i.e. by rotating a second
    plane angle around the axis common to both the plane and the solid angle in question.</p><p>Other
    existing or proposed units of Solid Angle are explored to test possible proportionality,
    or physical interpretation in terms of geometric figures on the sphere. No such
    interpretation is discovered.</p><p>It is concluded that it would not be justified
    to move the Steradian into the Base Units of SI, and that the status of this unit
    within SI requires careful re-evaluation.</p>
