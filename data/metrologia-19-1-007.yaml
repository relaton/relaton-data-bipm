abstract:
- content: "<p>Seventeen standard platinum resistance thermometers from five commercial
    sources have been subjected to repeated thermal cycling over all or most of the
    range -196 °C to +650 °C to determine whether strain effects occur in the platinum
    sensors, and to what precision they affect temperature measurements. It is found
    that the resistance at the triple point of water, when measured repeatedly during
    thermal cycling, does undergo reversible changes in many thermometers that can
    be attributed to either elastic or anelastic strain. The magnitude of this resistance
    irreproducibility is usually between the equivalent of 0.1 m °C and 1.8 m °C near
    0 °C. It is concluded that thermal strain effects pose a small, but significant,
    limitation on the ultimate performance of most of these thermometers.</p>"
