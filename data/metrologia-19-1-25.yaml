abstract:
- content: "<p>An account is given of radium measurements at the National Physical
    Laboratory from 1912, when the first British National Radium Standard was established,
    up to the present time. The implementation of a new method for the calibration
    of radium standards is described. This method is based upon germanium gamma-ray
    spectrometry used in conjunction with a well-characterized secondary standard,
    and it assures in the long term the continued traceability of NPL radium measurements
    to the 1934 British National Radium Standard of HÃ¶nigschmid.</p>"
