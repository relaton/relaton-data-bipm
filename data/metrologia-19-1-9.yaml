abstract:
- content: "<p>A novel absolute measuring procedure is presented for the definition
    of fixed points of the voltage in the 100 kV range. The method is based on transit
    time measurements with accelerated electrons.</p><p>By utilizing the selective
    interaction of a monoenergetic electron beam with the electromagnetic field of
    a special cavity resonator, the voltage is referred to fundamental constants and
    the base unit second. Possible balance voltages are indicated by a current detector.
    Experimental investigations are carried out with resonators in the normal conducting
    range. With a copper resonator operating at the temperature of boiling nitrogen
    (77 K), the relative uncertainty of the voltage points is estimated to be ± 4
    × 10<sup>-4</sup>. The technically realizable uncertainty can be reduced to ±
    1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> by the proposed application of a superconducting niobium resonator.</p><p>Thus
    this measuring device becomes suitable as a primary standard for the high-voltage
    range.</p>"
