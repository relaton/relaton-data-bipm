    <p>A novel absolute measuring procedure is presented for the definition of fixed points of the voltage in the 100 kV range. The method is based on transit time measurements with accelerated electrons.</p>
    <p>By utilizing the selective interaction of a monoenergetic electron beam with the electromagnetic field of a special cavity resonator, the voltage is referred to fundamental constants and the base unit second. Possible balance voltages are indicated by a current detector. Experimental investigations are carried out with resonators in the normal conducting range. With a copper resonator operating at the temperature of boiling nitrogen (77 K), the relative uncertainty of the voltage points is estimated to be ± 4 × 10<sup>-4</sup>. The technically realizable uncertainty can be reduced to ± 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> by the proposed application of a superconducting niobium resonator.</p>
    <p>Thus this measuring device becomes suitable as a primary standard for the high-voltage range.</p>
