abstract:
- content: "<p>A high-precision laser gravimeter for measuring the absolute value
    of gravitational acceleration by the free-fall method has been built in the Siberian
    Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Novosibirsk). The use of a free-fall interferometer
    illuminated by a He-Ne laser stabilized by an iodine absorption cell (<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>)
    together with high-speed electronic counters and a rubidium frequency standard,
    plus constructive measures aimed at reducing the action of non-gravitational forces,
    provide an accuracy of measurements better than 10<sup>-7</sup> m.s<sup>-2</sup>.
    In practice, the relative measurement error in g, as determined from convergence
    of the results of repeated measurements, is below 4 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> (4
    Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup> m s<sup>-2</sup>).</p><p>The gravimeter is used for geophysical
    experiments and in the investigation of non-tidal variations of the Earth's gravitational
    field.</p>"
