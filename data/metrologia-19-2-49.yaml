    <p>A high-precision laser gravimeter for measuring the absolute value of gravitational acceleration by the free-fall method has been built in the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Novosibirsk). The use of a free-fall interferometer illuminated by a He-Ne laser stabilized by an iodine absorption cell (<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>) together with high-speed electronic counters and a rubidium frequency standard, plus constructive measures aimed at reducing the action of non-gravitational forces, provide an accuracy of measurements better than 10<sup>-7</sup> m.s<sup>-2</sup>. In practice, the relative measurement error in <italic>g</italic>, as determined from convergence of the results of repeated measurements, is below 4 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> (4 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup> m s<sup>-2</sup>).</p>
    <p>The gravimeter is used for geophysical experiments and in the investigation of non-tidal variations of the Earth's gravitational field.</p>
