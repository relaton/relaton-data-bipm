  content: "<p>An experiment to measure the change in density of water which has been
    saturated with air is described and the results given. The 80 points taken in
    the range 4°C to 20°C have been fitted to the equation Δρ = -4.612 + 0.106 <italic>t</italic>
    with density in 10<sup>-3</sup> kg m<sup>-3</sup> and <italic>t</italic> in °C,
    and confidence limits have been given. Other results are discussed.</p>"
