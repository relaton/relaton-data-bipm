  content: "<p>A suspended-level capillary viscometer with some unusual features has
    been developed for use with pure liquids and liquid mixtures whose viscosities
    are affected by evaporation or exposure to the atmosphere. The timing system requires
    that the test liquid be at least weakly conducting. Excellent reproducibility
    of the flow time of water has been obtained with this instrument. Results for
    the viscosity of water in the temperature range 1 °C to 70 °C compare favourably
    with published values in terms of self-consistency. Estimates of the kinetic energy
    correction for capillaries with flared entries and exits have been made, and accord
    best with a t<sup>-2</sup> dependence.</p>"
