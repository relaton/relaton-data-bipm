abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of a comparison between iodine-stabilized He-Ne lasers
    of the CSMU and of the BIPM are presented. A successive-difference two-probe standard
    deviation ⟨ σ<sup>2</sup> (2, τ) ⟩<sup>1/2</sup> of 1 × 10<sup>-12</sup> at τ
    = 100 s and a mean frequency difference between the CSMU lasers and the BIPM laser
    of about 10 kHz (2 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) with a standard deviation of 2.0 kHz have
    been obtained. The linear coefficients of the modulation and pressure shifts correspond
    to published values. The frequency differences between fourteen iodine hyperfine
    structure components have been determined.</p>"
