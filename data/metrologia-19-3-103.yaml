  content: "<p>Laboratory reference standard accelerometers are calibrated in the
    range 14 m s<sup>-2</sup> to 5000 m s<sup>-2</sup> with excitation by nominally
    rectilinear, simple harmonic motion of known frequency. The displacement amplitude
    is established by a new interferometric technique, using a modified Michelson
    arrangement in which one reflector is the oscillating body of the accelerometer,
    and the second reflector is moved at a constant velocity. Each of the harmonics
    of the photoelectric signal goes to zero at certain amplitudes of oscillation.
    It is shown that all of the harmonics are amplitude-modulated at a frequency which
    is a function of the velocity of the second reflector, and that in consequence
    the zeros may be determined by ac null detection following synchronous detection
    of a harmonic. The technique is shown to minimize the effects of optical-path-difference
    variations caused by thermal drift and low-frequency ambient vibration. Errors
    caused by deviations from nominally rectilinear motion are reduced by averaging
    results from measurements made at different target positions on the top mounting
    surface of the accelerometer. These target positions are made accessible to the
    laser light by a number of holes through a dummy mass with which the accelerometer
    is loaded.</p>"
