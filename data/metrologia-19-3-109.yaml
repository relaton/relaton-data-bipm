abstract:
- content: "<p>The dynamical behaviour of the double-pan beam balance is investigated
    for the case of free vibration and also for the case of forced vibration of the
    type that is commonly called ground vibration; this being motion which is coupled
    to the balance via its central pivot. Considered first is the case of free vibration
    in which the central pivot is stationary. Here the small-angle approximation is
    made, thus linearizing the equations of motion and resulting in normal-mode solutions.
    Secondly, the case of a balance subjected to ground vibration is studied. Here
    the complexities of non-linearity and forced vibration are considered and, although
    this situation is difficult, in certain special cases the equations of motion
    are shown to be amenable to algebraic analysis. In particular, non-linear behaviour
    in the special case of free vibration is investigated. Finally, the effects of
    parametric excitation are also studied. The results of this analysis suggest a
    feedback control of the beam balance which will, if realized in practice, isolate
    it more effectively from ground vibration than has been possible in the past.</p>"
