abstract:
- content: "<p>Two formulae commonly used for the estimation of the centre of swing
    of an under-damped balance are shown to be biased using a damped-simple-harmonic-motion
    model. An alternative formula is suggested which gives results in better agreement
    with the value obtained by a least-squares fit but requiring less computation.</p>"
