abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper describes an experimental realization of the SI base unit
    for photometry, the candela, according to its new definition, by means of electrically
    calibrated radiometers. A group of seven stable radiometers has been developed,
    the value of irradiance measured by each radiometer differing from the mean value
    for the group by less than 0.1%. Corrections for the reflectance and thermal resistance
    of the black coating used in the conical cavity of each radiometer, and for shortcomings
    of the heat sink, have been measured precisely. Two sets of high-quality V(λ)
    filters have been made by a subtractive combination of coloured optical glasses
    and their spectral transmittances measured using a double monochromator. BDQ8
    and BDQ7 gas-filled tungstenfilament lamps, specially developed as secondary standards
    for luminous intensity, and stable within ±0.05%, were calibrated against the
    radiometers. The total uncertainty for the realization of the luminous intensity
    unit with the electrically calibrated radiometers is ±0.28%.</p>"
