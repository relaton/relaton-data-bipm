abstract:
- content: "<p>The wavelengths of an Ar<sup>+</sup> laser and of a He-Ne laser at
    515 nm and 612 nm, respectively, have been compared with the wavelength of a He-Ne
    laser at 633 nm. All the lasers involved were stabilized by using saturated absorption
    in iodine-127. The wavelength ratios were related to the He-Ne laser at 633 nm
    stabilized to the hyperfine component i of the rotational and vibrational transition
    R(127) 11-5 of iodine. For the Ar<sup>+</sup> laser locked to the component a<sub>3</sub>
    of the P(13) 43-0 line, the ratio determined was λ<sub>a3</sub>/λ<sub>i</sub>
    = 0.813 081 2954 × (1 ± 5 · 10<sup>-10</sup>) and for the 612 nm He-Ne laser locked
    to the component o of the R(47) 9-2 line, the measured ratio was λ<sub>o</sub>/λ<sub>i</sub>
    = 0.966 791 6050 × (1 ± 3 · 10<sup>-10</sup>).</p>"
