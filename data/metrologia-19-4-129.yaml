abstract:
- content: "<p>We wish to draw the attention of authors to two points concerning the
    presentation of manuscripts.</p><p>First, some changes have been made recently
    in our Instructions to Authors. We have reduced from two to one the number of
    duplicate copies of the manuscript required, asked for corrected proofs to be
    returned to the Editor rather than directly to the publishers, clarified that
    a single set of illustration-photographs will suffice, removed a specific suggestion
    for a style manual that we had offered for general guidance only, and added an
    instruction on conventions in spelling and hyphenation.</p><p>Secondly, authors
    are required, of course, to present a thorough analysis of their experimental
    data and to include an estimate of their uncertainty. For this purpose, however,
    we strongly encourage the authors to follow the recommendations put forward by
    an international working group [1] to the Comité International des Poids et Mesures
    (CIPM) and endorsed by that body in its Recommandation 1 (CI-1981). This recommendation
    has been published by the CIPM [2] and was also summarized recently in this journal
    [3].</p><p>[1] 1981 Metrologia 17 69-74, in particular, see pp 73-74</p><p>[2]

    is available on application to the Director of the Bureau International des Poids
