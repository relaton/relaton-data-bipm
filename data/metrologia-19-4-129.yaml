    <p>We wish to draw the attention of authors to two points concerning the presentation of manuscripts.</p>
    <p>First, some changes have been made recently in our Instructions to Authors. We have reduced from two to one the number of duplicate copies of the manuscript required, asked for corrected proofs to be returned to the Editor rather than directly to the publishers, clarified that a single set of illustration-photographs will suffice, removed a specific suggestion for a style manual that we had offered for  <italic>general</italic> guidance only, and added an instruction on conventions in spelling and hyphenation.</p>
    <p>Secondly, authors are required, of course, to present a thorough analysis of their experimental data and to include an estimate of their uncertainty. For this purpose, however, we strongly encourage the authors to follow the recommendations put forward by an international working group [1] to the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) and endorsed by that body in its Recommandation 1 (CI-1981). This recommendation has been published by the CIPM [2] and was also summarized recently in this journal [3].</p>
