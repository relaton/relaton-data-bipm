  content: "<p>A method of determining the absolute beam current in the NBS electron
    storage ring SURF-II by electron counting is described. Recent improvements and
    the present implementation of the technique are discussed, along with the results
    of an intercomparison with the NBS spectral irradiance scale.</p>"
