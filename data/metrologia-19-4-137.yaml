abstract:
- content: "<p>A mass comparator for the comparison of 1 kg weights was built according
    to a hydrostatic weighing principle, where the buoyancy in a liquid serves to
    compensate the force due to gravity. In accordance with the method known for hydrometers
    or areometers, the immersion depth of a float is measured as a function of the
    force due to gravity, using a laser interferometer. The substitution principle
    can thus be quite simply realized at constant load.</p><p>An essential advantage
    of this weighing method compared with the mechanical beam balance results from
    the frictionless and vibration-resistant bearing of the float in the liquid. For
    achieving a high accuracy with this technique, two prerequisites were important:
    the reduction of the influence of temperature by adapting the coefficients of
    expansion of buoyant body and liquid to each other, and the improvement of the
    wetting property of the liquid by adding a surfactant. The accuracy was further
    improved by the use of an electromagnetic feedback control to keep the immersion
    depth constant. By this method, a relative standard deviation of the weighings
    of better than 5 Ã— 10<sup>-9</sup> could be achieved.</p>"
