  content: "<p>The highly accurate conventional isotherms of Berry and dielectric
    constant isotherms of Gugan and Michel have been analysed in a mutually consistent
    way between 2.6 K and 27 K by the method of surface-fitting. Semi-empirical expressions
    are presented for the variation of the virial coefficients <italic>C</italic>(<italic>T</italic>)
    and <italic>D</italic>(<italic>T</italic>). A variety of expressions which conform
    to the expected theoretical constraints have been examined for <italic>B</italic>(<italic>T</italic>):
    the best of these agrees closely down to about 9 K with values recently calculated
    by Feltgen et al. using a potential derived from scattering experiments. The second
    dielectric virial coefficient <italic>b</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) shows a temperature
    dependence reasonably close to that calculated from the pair-polarizability given
    by Dacre, and the internal consistency of these results suggests that the values
    obtained for <italic>B</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) have an uncertainty of about
    ± 0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> down to 6 K, rising to perhaps ± 0.2 cm<sup>3</sup>
    mol<sup>-1</sup> below this. The temperature scale NPL-75 is assessed against
    several recent experiments: while there are indications of minor discrepancies
    the evidence is not conclusive and NPL-75 appears to be accurate at very close
    to the level originally claimed.</p>"
