abstract:
- content: "<p>The highly accurate conventional isotherms of Berry and dielectric
    constant isotherms of Gugan and Michel have been analysed in a mutually consistent
    way between 2.6 K and 27 K by the method of surface-fitting. Semi-empirical expressions
    are presented for the variation of the virial coefficients C(T) and D(T). A variety
    of expressions which conform to the expected theoretical constraints have been
    examined for B(T): the best of these agrees closely down to about 9 K with values
    recently calculated by Feltgen et al. using a potential derived from scattering
    experiments. The second dielectric virial coefficient b(T) shows a temperature
    dependence reasonably close to that calculated from the pair-polarizability given
    by Dacre, and the internal consistency of these results suggests that the values
    obtained for B(T) have an uncertainty of about ± 0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>
    down to 6 K, rising to perhaps ± 0.2 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> below this.
    The temperature scale NPL-75 is assessed against several recent experiments: while
    there are indications of minor discrepancies the evidence is not conclusive and
    NPL-75 appears to be accurate at very close to the level originally claimed.</p>"
