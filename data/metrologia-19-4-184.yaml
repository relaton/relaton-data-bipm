- content: "<p>The 1984 CPEM—the world's leading international biennial conference
    for electromagnetic metrology and related fundamental constants—will be held on
    20–24 August, 1984, at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.</p><p>Papers
    are requested for CPEM 84 which describe original work, not published or previously
    presented, covering the design, performance or application of electromagnetic
    measurements, techniques, instruments or systems.</p><p>In cooperation with the
    relevant commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP)
    the Conference Committee has decided that topics on fundamental constants related
    to electromagnetic measurements will also be part of CPEM 84.</p><p>All papers
    concerned with EM-measurements and related fundamental constants will be considered.
    Papers in the following fields are regarded as particularly appropriate for this
    conference:<p>EM-based fundamental constants and standards</p><p>direct current
    and low frequency</p><p>time and frequency</p><p>antennas and fields</p><p>microwaves
    and millimeter waves</p><p>(micro)computer-aided measurements</p><p>infrared,
    visible and ultraviolet radiation</p><p>electro optics, fibre optics</p><p>lasers</p><p>cryo-electronics</p><p>technical
    calibration services.</p></p><p>The conference language will be English. Authors
    are requested to submit a summary (500–1000 words) along with an abstract (maximum
    50 words) to facilitate paper selection by the programme committee. The summary
    must describe clearly what new and significant results have been obtained and
    why the results are important.</p><p>Summaries must be received on or before 1
    February, 1984 and must be sent to Prof. dr. H Postma, Technical Programme Chairman
    CPEM 84, Delft University of Technology, PO Box 5046, NL-2600 GA Delft, The Netherlands.</p><p>Authors
    will be notified before 15 May, 1984 whether their papers are accepted and informed
    of the manner of presentation and possible publication in the IEEE Trans. Instrum.
    Meas. conference issue.</p>"
