    <p>The 1984 CPEM—the world's leading international biennial conference for electromagnetic metrology and related fundamental constants—will be held on 20–24 August, 1984, at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.</p>
    <p>Papers are requested for CPEM 84 which describe original work, not published or previously presented, covering the design, performance or application of electromagnetic measurements, techniques, instruments or systems.</p>
    <p>In cooperation with the relevant commission of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) the Conference Committee has decided that topics on fundamental constants related to electromagnetic measurements will also be part of CPEM 84.</p>
    <p>All papers concerned with EM-measurements and related fundamental constants will be considered. Papers in the following fields are regarded as particularly appropriate for this conference:
     <list list-type="unordered">
     <list-item><p>EM-based fundamental constants and standards</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>direct current and low frequency</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>time and frequency</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>antennas and fields</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>microwaves and millimeter waves</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>(micro)computer-aided measurements</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>infrared, visible and ultraviolet radiation</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>electro optics, fibre optics</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>lasers</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>cryo-electronics</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>technical calibration services.</p></list-item>
    </list></p>
    <p>The conference language will be English. Authors are requested to submit a summary (500–1000 words) along with an abstract (maximum 50 words) to facilitate paper selection by the programme committee. The summary must describe clearly what new and significant results have been obtained and why the results are important.</p>
    <p>Summaries must be received on or before 1 February, 1984 and must be sent to Prof. dr. H Postma, Technical Programme Chairman CPEM 84, Delft University of Technology, PO Box 5046, NL-2600 GA Delft, The Netherlands.</p>
    <p>Authors will be notified before 15 May, 1984 whether their papers are accepted and informed of the manner of presentation and possible publication in the  <italic>IEEE Trans. Instrum. Meas.</italic> conference issue.</p>
