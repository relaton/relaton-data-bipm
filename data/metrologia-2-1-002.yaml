abstract:
- content: "<p>Epithermal and thermal flux parameters for the thermal flux density
    standard at the National Research Council have been measured to allow a more accurate
    calculation of activation rates. The epithermal spectrum is found to follow a
    E<sup>-0.95</sup> law, where E is the neutron energy. The effective neutron temperature
    in the irradiation cavity is found to be 42 °C which is 22 °C higher than the
    moderator temperature. A formula to calculate the reaction rate is given.</p>"
