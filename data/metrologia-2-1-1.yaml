  content: "<p>Epithermal and thermal flux parameters for the thermal flux density
    standard at the National Research Council have been measured to allow a more accurate
    calculation of activation rates. The epithermal spectrum is found to follow a
    <italic>E</italic><sup>-0.95</sup> law, where <italic>E</italic> is the neutron
    energy. The effective neutron temperature in the irradiation cavity is found to
    be 42 °C which is 22 °C higher than the moderator temperature. A formula to calculate
    the reaction rate is given.</p>"
