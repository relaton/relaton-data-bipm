abstract:
- content: "<p>The principles of radioactive disintegration rate measurement by the
    coincidence method are reviewed. It is shown that the basic equations for complex
    decay can be translated into formulae suitable for deducing absolute rates from
    observed counting data without requiring any knowledge of the decay scheme constants.
    The formulae are generally valid for β–γ emitters under conditions attainable
    in practical 4πβ–γ coincidence systems. Currently used techniques and various
    factors which influence the accuracy of measurement are discussed.</p>"
