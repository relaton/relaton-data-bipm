abstract:
- content: "<p>The system of electromagnetic quantities, units, and standards at frequencies
    of 30 kHz to approximately 1 GHz is briefly described. Its application at the
    National Bureau of Standards is used as an example. The system, with some minor
    modifications, appears to be in operation in several technically developed countries
    and is tentatively suggested for newly developing countries. Basic and derived
    physical quantities, and conceptual bases of standards and methods of measurement,
    are described. Ranges of accuracies are given and suggestions for extensions of
    the system and for establishing validity via international comparison are pointed
    out.</p>"
