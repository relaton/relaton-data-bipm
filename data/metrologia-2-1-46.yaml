abstract:
- content: "<p>The system of electromagnetic quantities at frequencies above 1 GHz
    (10<sup>9</sup> cycles per second) is briefly described, giving emphasis to those
    techniques and standards which have been most thoroughly evaluated and tested.
    The quantities included are power, noise temperature, reflection coefficient and
    impedance, phase shift, attenuation, and field strength. The measurement of frequency
    and wavelength, and of the microwave properties of materials is not within the
    scope of this paper.</p><p>In addition to a brief review, some of the problems
    involved in obtaining a higher order of accuracy are discussed. Comparisons of
    standards of different nations are mentioned and the benefits to be derived from
    such comparisons are described. Areas needing further research, as well as those
    which would benefit from international cooperation, are designated.</p><p>Although
    a highly detailed and technical presentation is avoided, numerous references are
    given. In addition, a selected list of definitions is appended.</p>"
