    <p>In the present investigation the values of the gold, silver and aluminium freezing points have been determined on the thermodynamic scale. The method used is based on Planck's radiation law, with the antimony freezing point as a reference temperature on the thermodynamic scale.</p>
    <p>Taking for c<sub>2</sub> the value 1.4388 × 10<sup>-2</sup> m. °K and for the freezing point of antimony Moser's value of 630.67 °C, it is found that the value of the gold point on the International Practical Temperature Scale needs a correction of +1.4 ± 0.4 °C, that of the silver point of +1.4 ± 0.3 °C and that of the aluminium point of +0.3 ± 0.07 °C.</p>
