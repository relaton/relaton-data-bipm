abstract:
- content: "<p>In the present investigation the values of the gold, silver and aluminium
    freezing points have been determined on the thermodynamic scale. The method used
    is based on Planck's radiation law, with the antimony freezing point as a reference
    temperature on the thermodynamic scale.</p><p>Taking for c<sub>2</sub> the value
    1.4388 × 10<sup>-2</sup> m. °K and for the freezing point of antimony Moser's
    value of 630.67 °C, it is found that the value of the gold point on the International
    Practical Temperature Scale needs a correction of +1.4 ± 0.4 °C, that of the silver
    point of +1.4 ± 0.3 °C and that of the aluminium point of +0.3 ± 0.07 °C.</p>"
