abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance of commercially produced, standard platinum resistance
    thermometers has been investigated in the region 630 - 900 °C. Particular attention
    was paid to resistance stability, quenching effects, and electrical insulation
    leakage. The limit of 900 °C was dictated by the use of mica insulation in these
    instruments.</p><p>The most serious problem encountered was that of insulation
    leakage at both high and low temperatures. The low temperature leakage was due
    to water that had been released from mica insulation when the thermometers were
    used at high temperatures, and this problem is studied in some detail here. A
    relationship between the magnitude of the galvanometer `wet kick' and the insulation
    resistance has been established. The useful lifetime of the dry air filling in
    a thermometer has been estimated for various conditions of use.</p><p>Based on
    these studies, procedures have been recommended for stabilizing platinum resistance
    thermometers, annealing-out quenching effects, and reducing insulation leakage
    over this temperature range.</p>"
