abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of a He-Ne laser as a light source improved the precision of
    an automatic fringe counting interferometer which previously used a Hg<sup>198</sup>
    source and extended its usefulness to the full one-meter limit of its carriage
    travel.</p><p>The laser wavelength was first determined by comparison of the fringes
    counted over a 91-mm length with both the laser and a Hg<sup>198</sup> source
    of known wavelength.</p><p>A one-meter line standard was calibrated by counting
    laser fringes. All measured decimeter interval lengths agreed with the assigned
    values within the mutual limits of uncertainty, the largest discrepancy being
    less than 0.5 Î¼m.</p><p>The result obtained for the total length of the line standard
    agreed with the assigned length of the line standard to 7 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.</p><p>The
    laser-illuminated fringe-counting interferometer is now in routine calibration
    service.</p>"
