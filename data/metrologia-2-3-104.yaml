abstract:
- content: <p>Without presenting experimental details, this report outlines and reappraises
    the principles involved in measurement of crystal lattice parameters and density
    for the determinations of atomic-weight values.</p><p>Attention is drawn to the
    advantages to be derived from a comparison of densities and lattice spacings with
    those of a crystal of mononuclidic elements, rather than from absolute measurements
    of X-ray spacings and density.</p><p>Errors arising from physical and chemical
    imperfections are discussed as are the general techniques of adequate precision
    for density and lattice spacings measurements.</p><p>Recent literature data are
    used by way of illustration to derive the effective atomic weight of calcium appertaining
    to a group of calcite samples from that of a group of silicon crystals (not an
    optimum "standard"). The calcium value obtained is 40.0795 Â± 0.0019 (probable
    error); it compares with IUPAC's adopted 40.08 and a "physical value" of 40.078
    from nuclidic masses and isotopic abundance measurements. There are several elements
    for which the X-ray/density method is judged to be potentially the most promising
    for atomic weight re-determinations in the foreseeable future.</p>
