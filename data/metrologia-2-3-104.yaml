    <p>Without presenting experimental details, this report outlines and reappraises the principles involved in measurement of crystal lattice parameters and density for the determinations of atomic-weight values.</p>
    <p>Attention is drawn to the advantages to be derived from a comparison of densities and lattice spacings with those of a crystal of mononuclidic elements, rather than from absolute measurements of X-ray spacings and density.</p>
    <p>Errors arising from physical and chemical imperfections are discussed as are the general techniques of adequate precision for density and lattice spacings measurements.</p>
    <p>Recent literature data are used by way of illustration to derive the effective atomic weight of calcium appertaining to a group of calcite samples from that of a group of silicon crystals (not an optimum "standard"). The calcium value obtained is 40.0795 Â± 0.0019 (probable error); it compares with IUPAC's adopted 40.08 and a "physical value" of 40.078 from nuclidic masses and isotopic abundance measurements. There are several elements for which the X-ray/density method is judged to be potentially the most promising for atomic weight re-determinations in the foreseeable future.</p>
