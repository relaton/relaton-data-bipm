    <p>The use of a He-Ne laser as a light source improved the precision of an automatic fringe counting interferometer which previously used a Hg<sup>198</sup> source and extended its usefulness to the full one-meter limit of its carriage travel.</p>
    <p>The laser wavelength was first determined by comparison of the fringes counted over a 91-mm length with both the laser and a Hg<sup>198</sup> source of known wavelength.</p>
    <p>A one-meter line standard was calibrated by counting laser fringes. All measured decimeter interval lengths agreed with the assigned values within the mutual limits of uncertainty, the largest discrepancy being less than 0.5 Î¼m.</p>
    <p>The result obtained for the total length of the line standard agreed with the assigned length of the line standard to 7 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>
    <p>The laser-illuminated fringe-counting interferometer is now in routine calibration service.</p>
