abstract:
- content: "<p>Design and performance of the NRC 2.1 meter cesium beam frequency standard
    are discussed. Construction of the beam tube, microwave cavity, and the electronics
    providing the beam excitation signal are outlined. Sources of error are discussed,
    and a value of 1.9 × 10<sup>-11</sup> is estimated as the upper limit. Comparisons
    via VLF transmissions over a 9 month period with similar standards at NPL, NBS,
    and LSRH are described in detail. Closest agreement exists between NRC and NBS
    with WWVB as the commonly measured signal. Maximum, mean, and r.m.s. deviations
    over a 7 month period were 18, 1.1 and 6.6 × 10<sup>-12</sup> for 15 day averages.</p>"
