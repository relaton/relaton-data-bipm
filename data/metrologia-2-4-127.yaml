abstract:
- content: "<p>An acoustical thermometer has been developed at the National Bureau
    of Standards to determine values of temperature that approximate the Thermodynamic
    Temperature Scale. The instrument, called an ultrasonic interferometer in acoustical
    literature, has been used to determine isotherms of the speed of sound in helium
    gas as a function of pressure. Each isotherm has been extrapolated to zero pressure
    to approximate the condition of an ideal gas; from the resulting intercepts, values
    of temperature were calculated.</p><p>The instrument and its operation are described
    and the data isotherms, which have been determined at approximately every degree
    from 2° - 20 °K, are listed. The isotherm data have been treated both graphically
    and by electronic computer analysis (by the method of least squares) to yield
    values of temperature that are the basis for a new temperature scale – NBS Provisional
    Scale 2 - 20 (1965). When the scale is compared with other existing scales, T<sub>58</sub>
    and NBS (1955), in regions of overlap, the agreement with NBS (1955) is excellent
    but noticable departures from T<sub>58</sub> - the helium-4 vapor pressure scale
    - are indicated.</p>"
