  content: "<p>With radiometers in which electrical heating is substituted for radiant
    heating, corrections are necessary for radiation reflected by the blackened receiver
    and for the thermal resistance of the black coating. Carbon-black and the common
    form of gold-black are unsuitable for coating radiometers because their thermal
    resistances are too high, and an optical lacquer tested has a comparatively high
    and selective reflectance. For the wavelength range 0.25 - 2.5 Î¼m the best material
    tested is a different form of gold-black, which entails corrections of about 0.005
    of the radiation value because of reflection losses, and of less than 0.001 because
    of thermal resistance effects. The mechanism of heat transport through the black
    coatings is discussed.</p>"
