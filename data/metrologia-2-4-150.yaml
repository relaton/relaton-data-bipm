  content: "<p>A photoelectric pyrometer has been developed with which the International
    Practical Temperature Scale (IPTS) above the gold point, 1063 °C, is realized
    about 5 times more accurately than with the prevalently used disappearing filament
    visual pyrometer. Estimated standard deviation uncertainties of realizing the
    IPTS with the photoelectric instrument are 0.06 deg C at 1063 °C, 0.12 deg C at
    1256 °C, 0.27 deg C at 1650 °C, 0.7 deg C at 2330 °C, and 2 deg C at 3525 °C.
    The design, evaluation, and calibration to realize the IPTS are discussed.</p>"
