abstract:
- content: "<p>The design of a cross-correlation noise thermometer based on a very-low-noise
    preamplifier and a high-speed, high-accuracy analog-to-digital converter is described.
    Error estimations indicate that the thermometer will have a basic accuracy better
    than 10 mK. Further self-check procedures are outlined that will reduce the systematic
    errors to approximately ±2 mK. The measurement time required to achieve a statistical
    uncertainty of ±3 mK is 2.5 days.</p><p>A thermometer of the design suggested
    is under construction at the Physics and Engineering Laboratory of the DSIR, for
    operation between 0 °C and 200 °C.</p>"
