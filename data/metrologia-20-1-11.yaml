  content: "<p>In measurements of the radiance or the spectral radiances of a source,
    a common procedure is to image the source on an opaque screen containing a small
    field aperture and to measure or analyse spectrally the flux passed. The area
    sampled is defined by the image of this aperture back on the source and thus,
    for an aberration-free system, by the aperture dimensions and the system magnification.
    If the imaging system is an off-axis spherical mirror, as is common practice,
    astigmatism can result in significant underestimation of the sampled area. Most
    radiance standards, such as tungsten ribbon-filament lamps, argon mini-arcs and
    deuterium discharge lamps, are significantly non-uniform, and failure to allow
    for astigmatism can lead to errors of up to several per cent. Conditions under
    which these errors can arise during transfer calibrations are discussed.</p>"
