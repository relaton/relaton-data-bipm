abstract:
- content: <p>Two dye lasers have been stabilized to component "o" of the 17-1 P(62)
    line in<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at 576 nm. The reproducibility of these lasers
    has been measured by beat-frequency techniques and the dependence of the laser
    frequency on depth of modulation, power, and iodine pressure determined. The frequency
    ratio between this laser and a He-Ne laser stabilized to component "i" of the
    11-5 R(127) line at 633 nm in<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> has been measured interferometrically
    with an uncertainty of ±1 × 10<sup>-10</sup>. Some iodine hyperfine component
    separations at 576 nm are also given.</p>
