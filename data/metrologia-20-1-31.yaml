    <p>The International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (the IPTS-68) has been in existence for over 16 years, during which time great advances have been made in thermometry at all levels. The author of this monograph has had an almost unique opportunity to observe and to contribute to these advances, and, hence, to describe the status of thermometry today. While he was at the National Physical Laboratory in England, he saw the introduction of the IPTS-68, and, as head of the thermometry group there, he participated in or was peripherally associated with many of the experiments which established the limitations of this scale and which will form the bases for a new international scale. His direct personal involvement was primarily with radiation thermometry, using both optical pyrometry at high temperatures and total radiation thermometry from the ice point to above 100 °C. He also initiated an acoustic interferometric determination of the gas constant, a project which was closely related to the low temperature acoustic thermometry done by one of his collaborators. Other NPL colleagues performed a definitive low temperature gas thermometer experiment, produced new helium vapor pressure scales, and developed the rhodium-iron resistance thermometer which is a standard for low temperature measurements. In addition, the NPL thermometry group obtained on loan platinum resistance thermometers from ten national standards laboratories and carried out a direct comparison of their calibrations below 0 °C, and hence, of the corresponding realizations of the IPTS-68. His position at the NPL and his early training in engineering also made him quite aware of the practical problems of thermometer users. During this period, he was the UK representative on the Comité Consultatif de Thermometrie (the CCT) of the Comité International des Poids et Measures (the CIPM). In recent years he has been Deputy Director of the Bureau International des Poids et Measures (the BIPM) and has maintained a very active interest in the affairs of the CCT.</p><p>The above outline of the author's background is given here to emphasize his qualifications for presuming to undertake the writing of such an extensive and comprehensive monograph, and for doing it so well,
    since no similar information is given in "Temperature" nor in any of the advertising. He successfully conveys the viewpoints of both the basic scientist, whose interests are in standards thermometry and forefront research, and the person whose goals are the selection and use of the most appropriate thermometer.</p><p>After an historical introduction, each of the various chapters (Thermodynamic and practical temperature scales, The measurement of thermodynamic temperatures, Fixed points and comparison baths, Resistance thermometry, Thermocouples, Radiation thermometry, Mercury-in-glass thermometry) and subsections has a similar format. This includes a capsule theoretical introduction and analysis of the subject to orient the reader and to establish limitations and approximations, a description of the current state of the art, and, finally, a nuts-and-bolts presentation which, where appropriate, includes industrial applications. Numerous tables, both in the text and in the appendices, document these discussions, along with an extensive listing of citations (close to 500) to original papers, review articles and other monographs.</p><p>The coverage of topics is thorough and well-balanced, and suffers only moderately (but not deleteriously) from the biases of the author. My interests in low temperature thermometry extend upwards to 0 °C, and the author's treatment of this area is comprehensive and is done with understanding. He appears to have done equally well done equally well in the sections on higher temperature and more applied thermometry. The theoretical discussions are to educate the reader about the basic physics and consequent limitations and problems in each area. This is a difficult task which is done well on the whole, although the discussions may be too detailed for the casual reader (who need read only the introduction and conclusions) and yet without sufficient detail for the person who requires a basic understanding (who then will consult the citations). Although he cannot anticipate the recommendations of the CCT for a new international temperature scale, the clues certainly are present in the discussions which he gives. Most important are the descriptions of the deviations of the IPTS-68 from thermodynamic temperatures, the limitations of thermocouples, and the need, which currently is met by the provisionally adopted EPT-76, for an extension of the international scale to temperatures below 13.8 K.</p><p>I am pleased to have this monograph available and anticipate making good use of it. Over the past several years I often have felt the need for a resource book to answer general questions or to obtain an introduction to an unfamiliar area of temperature measurement, and regret very much that "Temperature" was not available earlier. This monograph undoubtedly will be a necessity for any laboratory where thermodynamic measurements are carried out and thermometers are used as serious tools. A great deal of basic and developmental work has been done on thermometry in the past ten years or so, probably considerably more than remains to be done in many areas of the temperature scale. The publication of "Temperature" is timely in this respect, and it should have a long, useful life as a standard reference. The author may consider a second edition when a new international temperature scale is adopted, but there will be few corrections and only relatively minor changes and additions beyond the details of the new scale.</p>
