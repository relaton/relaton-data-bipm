abstract:
- content: "<p>Pulling by the wings of neighbouring field-dependent lines is usually
    taken into account in accuracy evaluation of caesium-beam frequency standards.
    Its magnitude is commonly calculated from the observed asymmetry of the neighbouring
    lines using a well-known formula in which the shape of all the Rabi lines is approximated
    with Lorentzian profiles of the same width.</p><p>In this paper it is shown that
    use of these approximations yields in most cases grossly underestimated results
    for the pulling, and that the real shape of the Rabi wings must be computed in
    order to match experimental data.</p><p>Line shapes far from Lorentzian and different
    widths for the different lines are obtained if the real rf field profile and the
    actual velocity distributions for each state are used. Unexpectedly high values
    are found in this way, which indicate this kind of frequency pulling as possibly
    the biggest single cause of inaccuracy in commercial caesium beams and a bias
    to be re-evaluated in primary laboratory standards.</p><p>Theoretical computations
    show good agreement with experimental data and suggest that the well-known average
    frequency difference of about +1 Ã— 10<sup>-12</sup> which is shown by the ensemble
    of all short commercial standards with respect to long primary tubes may be traced
    to Rabi pulling. The effect turns out to be dependent on modulation type and parameters.
    Dependence on rf power is also studied, which may be the primary cause of temperature
    sensitivity and flicker noise in short tubes, and the roles of source temperature
    and beam optics variations in relation to long-term drift are indicated.</p>"
