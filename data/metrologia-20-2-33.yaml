  content: "<p>End-to-end (and distributed) phase difference in Ramsey cavities has
    been suggested as being responsible for shifts up to several 10<sup>-12</sup>
    in short caesium-beam frequency standards. In this paper we re-examine this effect
    theoretically and we conclude that different systematic shifts may need to be
    found in order to explain the relatively wide frequency dispersion of such devices.</p>"
