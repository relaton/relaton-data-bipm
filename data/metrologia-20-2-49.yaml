abstract:
- content: "<p>The fluences and energies of d + T neutron fields of standardizing
    laboratories in nine countries have been intercompared by the activation of niobium
    and zirconium samples, with the subsequent measurement of induced activities at
    NPL. The niobium specific activities are compared with the fluences as determined
    by the participants. The ratios of zirconium to niobium specific activities are
    compared with the mean neutron energies as calculated or determined by the participants.
    The agreement is generally satisfactory and the uncertainty contribution due to
    the transfer method has insignificant effect on the overall accuracy.</p>"
