abstract:
- content: "<p>Fluence determinations for 2.5 MeV and 5 MeV neutrons as performed
    in standards laboratories have been compared. The intercomparison method is based
    on the determination of a Î³-rate ratio between<sup>115m</sup>In as induced by
    fast neutrons in an indium sample on one hand, and<sup>51</sup>Cr from a calibrated
    source on the other hand. Results show that the uncertainty contribution from
    the transfer method does not essentially increase the overall uncertainty and
    that there is consistency with only one exception.</p>"
