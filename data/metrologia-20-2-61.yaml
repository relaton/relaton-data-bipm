abstract:
- content: "<p>We have investigated the consequences of cold work introduced in handling
    PtRh versus Pt thermocouples and found changes in the Seebeck coefficient of up
    to -40 nV/°C and errors in calibration of up to -0.4%. We show that above 200
    °C recovery in the Seebeck coefficient towards its pre-cold-worked value occurred
    at an increasing rate with temperature but that in the PtRh leg, unlike the Pt
    leg, the recovery was not complete. A residual effect, attributed to PtRh, of
    up to -4 μV remained in thermocouple emf after recovery anneals had been applied.
    Recommendations are made for the handling of high-quality Pt-based thermocouples.</p>"
