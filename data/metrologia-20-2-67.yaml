abstract:
- content: "<p>The difference (T-T<sub>68</sub>) between the thermodynamic and international
    practical temperatures has been measured in the range from 730 K to 903 K. The
    systematic uncertainty amounts ±20 mK and the random uncertainty ±3 mK at 903
    K and 99% confidence level. As a part of this investigation the thermodynamic
    freezing temperature of aluminium was determined as 933.450 K (±21 mK systematic
    and ±7 mK random uncertainty at 99% confidence level). The values measured of
    (T-T<sub>68</sub>) deviate significantly from those of Coates and Andrews (1982).
    However, they agree very well with results of Bonhoure (unpublished). All measurements
    of this work have been performed by means of a photoelectric dc-pyrometer equipped
    with an unbiased Si-photodetector of excellent linearity. The effective wavelength
    was set to approximately 974 nm by a dielectric multilayer interference filter
    of 40.6 nm half-width. The measurements will be continued.</p>"
