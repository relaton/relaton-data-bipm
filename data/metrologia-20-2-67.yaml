  content: "<p>The difference (<italic>T-T</italic><sub>68</sub>) between the thermodynamic
    and international practical temperatures has been measured in the range from 730
    K to 903 K. The systematic uncertainty amounts ±20 mK and the random uncertainty
    ±3 mK at 903 K and 99% confidence level. As a part of this investigation the thermodynamic
    freezing temperature of aluminium was determined as 933.450 K (±21 mK systematic
    and ±7 mK random uncertainty at 99% confidence level). The values measured of
    (<italic>T-T</italic><sub>68</sub>) deviate significantly from those of Coates
    and Andrews (1982). However, they agree very well with results of Bonhoure (unpublished).
    All measurements of this work have been performed by means of a photoelectric
    dc-pyrometer equipped with an unbiased Si-photodetector of excellent linearity.
    The effective wavelength was set to approximately 974 nm by a dielectric multilayer
    interference filter of 40.6 nm half-width. The measurements will be continued.</p>"
