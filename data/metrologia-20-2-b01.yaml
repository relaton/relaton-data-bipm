- content: '<p>The NATO Advanced Study Institute held at Erice, Sicily, in November
    1981 brought together specialists in precise measurement to present a tutorial
    introduction to quantum metrology and the measurement of the fundamental physical
    constants.</p><p>Ever since the evolution of experimental physics as a scientific
    pursuit the measurement of the values of quantities accepted to be constants of
    nature has commanded the attention of some of the world''s most accomplished workers
    in this field. Their efforts to seek out the sources of systematic error and to
    reduce the random errors have produced significant advances in techniques and
    a continual interest in their results from users and critics: as Raymond T Birge,
    who pioneered the evaluation of the ''best'' values of the constants from the
    available measurements, observed (perhaps with tongue-in-cheek) "it is the continual
    variation in the values of these quantities that furnishes most of the interest
    in the subject". Long before the recognition of the fundamental constants the
    measurement of mass, length and time grew as a matter of necessity in organized
    communities, especially in agriculture, commerce and navigation. The adoption
    of standards, first local, then national, and now international, was a natural
    consequence. It is particularly relevant that the published proceedings of the
    NATO school opens with a historical survey by Pierre Giacomo of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures, which places the subsequent papers in perspective.</p><p>Measurements
    which realize the standards of length and time, and those from which values of
    the fundamental constants are derived, are of such a nature that a considerable
    background knowledge of physics is needed for their understanding. (The principle
    of the caesium frequency standard and the physics of the Josephson junction are
    a long haul from Michelson''s measurement of the speed of light and the Millikan
    oil drop experiment familiar in the school books.) With this in mind, George Series
    presents as an introductory article a characteristically clear résumé of the quantum
    mechanical background of spectroscopy which, although too condensed to compete
    with the textbooks, provides an admirable checklist of what one needs to know.
    Pierre Cerez does the same for the physics of masers and lasers, and follows this
    with an account of present-day time and frequency standards. The establishment
    and world-wide distribution of these standards, and the related subjects of length,
    wavelength and optical frequency standards are covered in detail, and more history
    is related in a review of past measurements of the speed of light. Now that the
    measurement of the speed of light has become an irrelevance as a result of its
    definition as an exact quantity, thus abolishing the need for a direct standard
    of length, the article by K M Baird is bound to rouse nostalgia. In this connection
    it is a delight to find reprinted at the end of the volume the text of the article,
    published in 1773, giving an account of Roemer''s method (1676) for measuring
    the speed of light and the first indication that it is finite.</p><p>The most
    significant impact on the measurement of the fundamental constants was made by
    the discovery of quantum effects and the development of the quantum theory. Planck''s
    constant plays the key role here, and quantum metrology has merged the quantum
    and classical fields. Thus the volt can be referred to a frequency, through the
    Josephson effect, in a particularly (and unexpectedly) direct manner, and magnetic
    field strengths can be compared as a ratio of frequencies, and measured in terms
    of the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton. Techniques of this sort are reviewed
    by Brian Petley of the National Physical Laboratory, who also contributes valuable
    articles on the particular measurements which involve magnetic moments, and a
    general survey of the significance of the fundamental constants as a whole.</p><p>Laser
    spectroscopy has in recent years played an important part in the measurement of
    quantities, such as the fine-structure constant, which are related to fundamental
    constants, and in tests of quantum electrodynamics. A clear example of this is
    given in an article by Carl Wieman of the University of Michigan illustrating
    the spectacular advances that have been made in resolving the spectrum of atomic
    hydrogen by saturated absorption techniques.</p><p>On a more practical note, there
    are articles on the application of metrological techniques to geoscience and astrophysics,
    and, in particular, of precise time and frequency measurements to navigation,
    gravity and positioning. Richard Cohen, who has been concerned with the subject
    for a considerable time, summarizes the present status of the fundamental constants,
    and as a tail-piece of the volume there are a number of seminar contributions
    on specialized topics.</p><p>The scope of the volume is wide-ranging, both in
    subject matter and level. Its primary aim, as was the aim of the NATO school,
    is tutorial, and in this it succeeds admirably. The choice, both of authors and
    titles, ensures this; but there is more besides. Those already familiar with the
    field can still find much of interest in the review articles and in the more specialized
    contributions. It is a source of instruction for the beginner and a place for
    the expert to browse.</p>'
