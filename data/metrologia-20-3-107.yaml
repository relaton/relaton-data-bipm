  content: "<p>The following is a description of a precise fringe signal processing
    method for measuring the acceleration due to the Earth's gravity which we have
    developed at the International Latitude Observatory of Mizusawa. The frequency
    of the interference fringe signal is proportional to the falling object's velocity.
    We measure the fringe phase, the fractional part of the fringe number, rather
    than the fringe number itself, at constant time intervals. Since the fringes need
    not be counted, and the fringe detection system is simple, the method offers substantial
    advantages for vibration compensation and data reduction.</p>"
