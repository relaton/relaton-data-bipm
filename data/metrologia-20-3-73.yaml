  content: "<p>A quasi-isothermal method of operating an absorbed-dose graphite calorimeter
    is described in theory and practice. In contrast with the well-known quasi-adiabatic
    operation, which entails temperature increases during measurements, in the quasi-isothermal
    mode the temperatures of the different graphite bodies remain constant except
    for small temperature drifts throughout the measurement. This implies that the
    temperature dependence of the specific heat of the absorber and of the sensitivity
    of the temperature sensor influence the absorbed-dose determination significantly
    less. The method is characterized by a power-compensating measuring principle
    which is illustrated with a 3-body graphite calorimeter. Comparisons of the quasi-isothermal
    with the quasi-adiabatic method of operation showed good agreement.</p>"
