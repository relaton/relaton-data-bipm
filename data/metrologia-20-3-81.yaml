  content: "<p>The fractional frequency shift in the nmr signal from protons in a
    spherically-shaped pure water sample has been measured directly as -10.36(30)
    × 10<sup>-9</sup> °C<sup>-1</sup> over the range 5 °C to 45 °C. A revised value
    of 25.69(14) × 10<sup>-6</sup> is suggested for the proton diamagnetic shielding
    correction in water at 25 °C, leading to μ'<sub>p</sub>(25 °C)/μ<sub>B</sub> =
    0.001 520 993 136(17).</p>"
