abstract:
- content: "<p>The free-field calibration of a group of three one-inch capacitor microphones
    has been carried out over a frequency band extending from 19.95 kHz down to 316.2
    Hz using the reciprocity method recommended by the IEC in Publication 486 (1974).
    The bridge method used for the electrical measurement gives information about
    both magnitude and phase; in magnitude, the results generally fall within Â± 0.1
    dB of their mean values. A companion paper considers the correlation of the free-field
    results with those from low-frequency coupler measurements and with results obtained
    using an electrostatic actuator.</p>"
