abstract:
- content: <p>By means of a 1-metre Fabry-Perot etalon, a measurement has been made
    of the frequency ratio of a He-Ne laser, stabilized to component "i" of the 11-5,
    R(127) transition in<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at 473 THz, relative to a laser
    stabilized to transition ν<sub>3</sub>, P(7), component F<sup>(2)</sup><sub>2</sub>
    of methane at 88 THz. This result, f<sub>i</sub>/f<sub>CH4</sub> = 5.359 048 172
    57 which has a fractional standard deviation of 2 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, is used
    with the result of a previous frequency measurement of the 88 THz laser in order
    to calculate the frequency of the 473 THz reference laser.</p>
