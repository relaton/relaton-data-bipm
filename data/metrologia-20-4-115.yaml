  content: '<p>This report deals with a comparison of national standards of rf voltage
    organized by the radiofrequency working group of the "Comité Consultatif d''Electricité"
    of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). It was done by sending
    round transfer standards, for each of which the participating laboratories had
    to measure the rf-dc difference for a reading of 1 V at frequencies from 100 MHz
    to 1 GHz. The seven standardizing laboratories participating in this comparison
    were: ASMW (GDR), EQD (UK), NBS (USA), NML (Australia), OMH (Hungary), PTB (FRG)
    and VNIIM (USSR). The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) acted as pilot
    laboratory. Two kinds of transfer standards were circulated in two separate cycles:
    two resistance mounts (50 Ω and 75 Ω input impedance) and two thermal converters
    made available by the PTB and the OMH. The results are presented in two tables
    and 16 bar charts. A weighted mean value for each transfer standard and frequency
    was calculated from the measurement results. Good agreement between the measurement
    values of all participants was achieved. For resistance-mount transfer standards
    the deviations of the measured values from the weighted mean values were ⩽ 4 ×
    10<sup>-3</sup> for all frequencies up to 1 GHz, for thermal converters all deviations
    were ⩽ 3 × 10<sup>-3</sup> at 100 MHz and ⩽ 1.2 × 10<sup>-2</sup> at 1 GHz (excluding
    one measurement point). All the transfer standards remained sufficiently stable
    over a measuring period of more than 5 years.</p>'
