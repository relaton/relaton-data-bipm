abstract:
- content: "<p>An International Intercomparison of Fixed Points by Means of Sealed
    Cells has been conducted under the auspices of the Comité Consultatif de Thermométrie
    (CCT) between 1978 and 1984. Forty-one sealed cells, realizing the triple point
    of seven different substances, defining both primary fixed points of the IPTS-68
    and secondary fixed points in the temperature range from 14 K to 90 K, were supplied
    by nine laboratories. They were measured in eleven national laboratories around
    the world, against the fixed points realized in these laboratories (both in open
    cryostats or in other sealed cells). Some 150 independent series of data were
    produced, from almost 300 melting experiments, representing some 2,300 equilibrium
    temperature values. The basic sets of results are presented, concerning the agreement
    between different cell realizations and the comparison of national IPTS-68 realizations.
    Data connecting the results of this intercomparison with that performed at NPL
    in 1975 using calibrated thermometers are also given.</p>"
