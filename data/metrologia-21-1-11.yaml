abstract:
- content: "<p>The quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a phenomenon visible in Hall effect
    measurements on a two-dimensional electron gas in strong magnetic fields and at
    low temperatures. The experimental results on such systems in the limit of zero
    temperature demonstrate that the Hall resistance R<sub>H</sub> as a function of
    the magnetic field B shows plateaux with plateau values which are, within the
    experimental uncertainty, independent of the material, the geometry of the device,
    and other parameters. For an ideal system R<sub>H</sub> depends exclusively on
    fundamental constants, but for real experiments corrections may be necessary which
    are important, if the QHE is applied in metrology.</p>"
