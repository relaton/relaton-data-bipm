  content: "<p>The quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a phenomenon visible in Hall effect
    measurements on a two-dimensional electron gas in strong magnetic fields and at
    low temperatures. The experimental results on such systems in the limit of zero
    temperature demonstrate that the Hall resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub>
    as a function of the magnetic field <italic>B</italic> shows plateaux with plateau
    values which are, within the experimental uncertainty, independent of the material,
    the geometry of the device, and other parameters. For an ideal system <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub>
    depends exclusively on fundamental constants, but for real experiments corrections
    may be necessary which are important, if the QHE is applied in metrology.</p>"
