  content: "<p>The effects of dissolved atmospheric gases on the density of water
    are investigated by hydrostatic pycnometry, and subsequently the effect of air
    dissolved in water is estimated according to the contributions of the respective
    gases and the air composition. The calculated result agrees with the experimentally-obtained
    decrease of the density with a systematic deviation of less than 0.16 × 10<sup>-3</sup>
    kg/m<sup>3</sup> (0.16 ppm) in the temperature range between 0 °C and 40 °C. In
    addition, the partial molar volumes of nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide
    under atmospheric pressure are calculated.</p>"
