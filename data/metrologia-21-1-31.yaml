  content: "<p>This paper describes the measurement of the difference between the
    International Practical Temperature Scale (IPTS-68) and thermodynamic temperature
    in the range 457 °C-630 °C using the NPL photon-counting pyrometer. This instrument
    operates at sufficiently low radiance temperatures to allow the gas thermometry
    results of Guildner and Edsinger, which cover the range from 0 °C to 457 °C, to
    be extended upwards. The results agree well with the recent measurements of Jung
    (1984). Their implications with respect to the differences at still higher temperatures
    are discussed briefly.</p>"
