  content: "<p>With the discovery of the quantum Hall effect the SI units ampere,
    volt, and ohm may be realized with high accuracy by performing four fundamental-constant
    determinations requiring only a consistent set of laboratory electrical units.
    Accurate values in SI units for most other constants, including the Avogadro and
    fine-structure constants, may also be obtained from the same measurements.</p>"
