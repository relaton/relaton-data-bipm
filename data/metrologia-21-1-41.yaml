abstract:
- content: <p>"Microdosimetry" is the latest title to be issued by the International
    Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements in their well known and well respected
    Report series. The subject is concerned with the study of the spatial distribution
    of energy deposition along the tracks of ionizing radiations. On a microscopic
    scale such energy deposition is far from uniform and, while a full description
    of the interaction of ionizing radiations with matter together with the consequences
    of such interactions is probably unmanageable in interpreting the microscopic
    effects of radiation, nevertheless a study of energy deposition in volumes comparable
    to the elemental structures being affected is an obvious starting point. The Report
    is a comprehensive review of microdosimetric concepts and techniques, both experimental
    and theoretical and forms a very useful state-of-the-art review.</p><p>The first
    major chapter describes the quantities needed for microdosimetry and their interrelation.
    The next chapter very briefly reviews the primary interactions between ionizing
    radiations and matter, whilst in the following one the physical processes involved
    in the interaction of charged particles (mainly electrons and fast ions) are described
    in more detail together with the processes by which such particles lose energy,
    and the spatial distribution of energy deposits. Then come two chapters on, respectively,
    the experimental determination and theoretical calculation of various microdosimetric
    quantities. The principal detector for microdosimetric measurements is, of course,
    the gas proportional counter, usually operated at low pressure. The various techniques
    used to simulate small volume cavities are discussed, with their limitations,
    while an appendix describes in detail some of the designs of proportional counters
    that have been used. A fairly reliable indication that any new frontier of science
    has emerged from the "gee whizz" stage to more mature respectability is given
    when its proponents start to discuss uncertainties seriously; in this respect
    it is significant that there is a section in the experimental chapter on just
    this topic. In the theoretical calculations of microdosimetric quantities two
    methods have been used, viz., the analytical and the Monte Carlo methods, although
    so far mainly for fast neutrons only. Most interest centres on the differences
    between the theoretical and experimental data rather than on the relative merits
    of the two theoretical approaches, the limitations of the experimental method
    generally being identified as the culprit for most discrepancies.</p><p>The final
    chapter is perhaps the most interesting, especially to the reader with a more
    general interest. It deals with the various applications of microdosimetry to
    the real world of radiation, including the vexed question of the specification
    of radiation quality as well as the microdosimetric implications in radiation
    chemistry, radiobiology and radiation protection. Interesting though these applications
    are, it has to be said that the overall impact of microdosimetry on ionizing radiation
    activities generally has been less than one might have been led to expect. Perhaps
    the pay-off has yet to come when the techniques become even more refined.</p><p>The
    Report has several useful appendices and an extensive list of references. It is
    certainly a "must" for anyone entering the field and it is a very convenient reference
    datum for practitioners.</p>
