  content: "<p>Melting curves of indium samples of 99.9999%, 99.999%, and 99.99% purity
    were obtained adiabatically. For the purest sample, the liquidus point temperature
    at the triple point pressure was found to be 156.6298 °C, and the latent heat
    of fusion was found to be 28.53 J/g, with standard deviations of ± 0.4 mK and
    ± 0.02 J/g respectively.</p>"
