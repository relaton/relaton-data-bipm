abstract:
- content: <p>"Zerodur", a glass ceramic, has been developed in order to have a material
    with an extremely small thermal expansion coefficient. The known physical properties
    are completed here by results on dimensional stability compiled over a number
    of years. Three samples of the material with different thermal histories show
    different shrinkage during a period of observation over 10 years. The description
    of the behaviour by mathematical formulas, logarithmic, hyperbolic or exponential,
    is in all cases nearly satisfactory. The relative alteration of length is between
    - 0.69 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and - 0.03 × 10<sup>-6</sup> per year.</p>
