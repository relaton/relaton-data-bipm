abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of an additional defining point on the International Temperature
    Scale between 90.188 K and 273.15 K is advocated. The triple point of xenon is
    suggested as the candidate and an experimental technique which gives the required
    degree of reproducibility for the melting curves is described. Results obtained
    for natural xenon and xenon enriched to 80%<sup>136</sup>Xe are given. It is concluded
    that the triple point of xenon can be realized with sufficient reproducibility
    that it can be used as a defining point on an International Temperature Scale.</p>"
