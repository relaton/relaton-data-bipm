abstract:
- content: "<p>The average number of neutrons (ν̄) emitted per fission event in the
    spontaneous fission of<sup>252</sup>Cf has been determined by separate absolute
    measurements of the fission rate and the neutron emission rate per mg of a solution
    of californium chloride. The fission rate was determined by a hitherto untried
    method based on fission-fission coincidences, and the neutron emission rate was
    determined by the well-known manganese sulphate bath technique. The measurements
    were carried out during the period 1968 to 1972, and several provisional values
    of ν̄ have been released from time to time. The results have now been subjected
    to a rigorous statistical treatment in which correlations were treated by covariance
    matrices.</p><p>The value for ν̄(total) for<sup>252</sup>Cf is (3.7509±0.0107)
    neutrons per fission. This value supersedes all previously released provisional
    values.</p>"
