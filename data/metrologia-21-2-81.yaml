abstract:
- content: "<p>Oxide-bias measurement techniques to determine front-surface recombination
    losses in the silicon photodiode self-calibration technique have been investigated.
    With the water-drop method it has been shown necessary to restrict the applied
    bias voltage to the very minimum necessary to produce photocurrent saturation,
    otherwise non-reversible degradation of quantum efficiency may occur. The corona
    technique has been found to give satisfactory results only on initial application,
    as a drastic increase in front-region recombination loss is produced.</p>"
