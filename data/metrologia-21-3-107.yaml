  content: "<p>The results of the four absolute determinations of the density of mercury
    since 1945 are discussed. When reduced to a common temperature scale the values
    differ by more than the claimed uncertainties. Results are presented of a comparative
    measurement of the density of two further samples of mercury in terms of a reference
    sample. The density difference is determined by measuring the change in apparent
    mass of a tungsten carbide block when fully immersed in each mercury sample. The
    standard deviation of the measured density difference between the samples and
    the reference was found to be 4 Ã— 10<sup>-4</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The values
    obtained show significant differences in density, and the possible cause, i.e.
    variation in the isotopic ratios between samples, is discussed. We confirm that
    the density of mercury must be measured if it is required to be known to better
    than a few parts in 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>"
