abstract:
- content: <p>A first, simple theory of thermal fluctuations of ideal rigid rotors
    is presented, along with some representative measurements and analysis of a real
    rotor. The ideal rotor has a power spectrum of fractional frequency fluctuations
    with two regions. At low frequency it is flat, and at high frequency it varies
    as Ï‰<sup>-2</sup>. A related measure, the level of fluctuations as a function
    of measuring time (the Allan variance), is presented. Our present magnetically
    suspended rotors are shown to have an excess noise amplitude of about 10<sup>4</sup>
    times the ideal level. "Electronic cooling" by feedback can provide great improvement
    in both the noise amplitude and spectral behavior of the ideal rotor.</p>
