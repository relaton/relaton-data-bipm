abstract:
- content: "<p>Noise sources consisting of an electromagnetic horn aimed at an absorbing
    material have been in use for many years. A satisfactory derivation of the noise
    temperature for such a configuration has been missing, however, preventing the
    use of this horn-type noise source as a primary reference standard. The derivation
    described in this paper models the various noise emitters within the source well
    enough to provide an accurate estimate of the noise temperature and a complete
    error analysis.</p>"
