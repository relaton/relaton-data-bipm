  content: "<p>Recent accurate thermodynamic data from a number of laboratories are
    combined to provide the basis for a reference function for platinum resistance
    thermometer interpolation between 13.81 K and 273.15 K. The values of thermodynamic
    temperature for the defining fixed points of the International Practical Temperature
    Scale and also for a number of secondary points are more accurately assigned than
    heretofore. It is concluded that a temperature scale based on this reference function
    and these more accurate values of the defining fixed points would represent thermodynamic
    temperatures to within Â± 2 mK. The reference function and the new values of the
    defining fixed points are proposed for use in the revision of the International
    Practical Temperature Scale.</p>"
