  content: "<p>The adoption in 1979 of a new definition of the candela, which permitted
    a detector-based approach to the realization of the unit, has emphasized the importance
    of high-accuracy absolute radiation detectors. This paper describes a new electrical-substitution
    absolute radiometer operating at 5 K, based on a standard commercial helium cryostat,
    which has been developed at NPL for optical radiant-power measurements. The principal
    advantages of operating the radiometer at liquid helium temperatures are that
    the detector can be a large, highly absorbing cavity (absorptivity 99.998%) and
    that exact equivalence of electrical and radiant heating can be clearly demonstrated.
    It will be the primary absolute detector for a new realization of the candela
    at NPL and will provide the basis for the development of a wider range of radiometric
    and spectroradiometric standards. The use of the radiometer to measure the radiant
    power of an intensity-stabilized laser source at the milliwatt level with an uncertainty
    of 4 parts in 10<sup>5</sup> is also described, together with its application
    in the determination of the responsivity of transfer-standard detectors, such
    as silicon photodiodes.</p>"
