abstract:
- content: "<p>When using radiometers of the bolometric type for measuring low radiant
    power (for instance, when realizing photometric scales) one frequently employs
    the constant-sensor-output technique, in which electrical power is applied in
    such a way as to match the incident radiant power. This electrical power exhibits
    both noise and drift, which must be subtracted in the data-processing. Limitations
    of the well-known least-squares model used for fitting the drift are pointed out
    and a new least-squares model is developed. An autoregressive model of the time
    series formed by the electrical power values gives a description of the system
    and a new procedure for the calculation of the radiant power. Differences in the
    application of the least-squares and proposed autoregressive models are evaluated.</p>"
