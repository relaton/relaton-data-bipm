abstract:
- content: <p>The current methods for measuring the Lamb shift δ in the hydrogen atom
    (n = 2) have been considered. The possibility of the determination of the proton
    radius from the available theoretical and experimental data has been estimated.
    The Lamb-shift value obtained by the "atomic interferometer" proved to be 1057.8514(19)
    MHz. The corresponding values of the mean-square proton radius are ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩<sup>1/2</sup>
    = 0.76 ± 0.01 fm (for δ<sub>theor.</sub> = 1057.864(14) MHz) and ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩<sup>1/2</sup>
    = 0.59 ± 0.02 fm (for δ<sub>theor.</sub> = 1057.910(10) MHz).</p>
