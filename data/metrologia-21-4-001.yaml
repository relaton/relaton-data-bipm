abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of an international agreement between the UK and the USSR (Cooperation
    in Metrology), the respective national standards of voltage based on Josephson-effect
    systems situated at the Mendeleev Institute of Metrology (VNIIM), Leningrad and
    the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), Teddington have been intercompared using
    two separate groups of transportable standard cells in the period December 1981
    to December 1982. For a group of cells maintained at 30 °C in a commercial thermoregulated
    enclosure it was found that (V<sub>VNIIM</sub> - V<sub>NPL</sub>)/V<sub>NPL</sub>
    = + 4.63 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; and for a group of bare cells measured at 20 °C (V<sub>VNIIM</sub>
    - V<sub>NPL</sub>)/V<sub>NPL</sub> = + 5.18 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, with + 4.50 × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    of this difference being due to the different values of the Josephson constants
    (nominally 2e/h) used in the two countries.</p>"
