abstract:
- content: "<p>A technique is described for the measurement of nuclear reaction  Q
    -values with an accuracy of a few parts in 10<sup>5</sup>, in which the ultimate
    reference is a one-volt standard. As a test of the technique the accurately known
    threshold energy of the<sup>7</sup>Li(p, n)<sup>7</sup>Be reaction, 1880.51 ±
    0.08 keV, has been remeasured. The value found using the present technique is
    1880.443 ± 0.020 keV, in good agreement with previous values. An attempt to see
    evidence for atomic excitation effects in the<sup>27</sup>A1(p,n)<sup>27</sup>Si
    reaction is also discussed. This yielded a new value of 5803.73 ± 0.12 keV for
    the threshold of this reaction, again in a good agreement with, but more accurate
    than, previous values. Further test measurements are summarized. The main application
    of the technique, in measurements related to the theory of weak interactions,
    is discussed briefly and the results obtained to date are presented.</p>"
