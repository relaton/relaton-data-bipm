abstract:
- content: "<p>A listing of the latest of these preprints, and of recent relevant
    publications, is still being distributed periodically by the Office of Standard
    Reference Data of the United States' National Bureau of Standards. The editors,
    B N Taylor and D R Lide, point out that this listing of preprints provides a service,
    the success of which depends on the active cooperation of the scientific community.
    They therefore remind authors to send copies of their preprints, as early as is
    convenient, to: PPMFC, National Bureau of Standards, Bldg 220, Rm B 258, Gaithersburg,
    MD 20899, USA.</p><p>This address is also the source of the listing and relevant
    information, but not the preprints themselves.</p>"
