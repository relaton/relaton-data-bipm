abstract:
- content: "<p>The superconducting transition of niobium was investigated to test
    and to improve its suitability as a thermometric fixed point of the temperature
    scale. The superconducting transition temperatures (ST-temperatures) of three
    high-purity niobium samples (two single crystals and a polycrystalline wire, having
    residual resistance ratios larger than 10,000 and 6000, respectively) were found
    to differ by no more than the resolution of the measuring apparatus, 0.2 mK. The
    transition widths were 0.3 mK. The ST-temperature was T<sup>c</sup><sub>76</sub>
    = (9.288<sub>5</sub> Â± 0.002) K.</p><p>When using the sample parameters as a basis,
    theoretical estimations indicate that the ST-temperature of the three samples
    may differ by less than 1 mK from that of ideal niobium which is in agreement
    with the experimentally obtained results. The value of the ST-temperature and
    the transition width proved to be nearly insensitive to mechanical stresses and
    no drift could be found after storage of the samples in air for long periods.
    Therefore niobium appears to be the most suitable material to establish a superconducting
    thermometric fixed point with a precision of 0.1 mK.</p>"
