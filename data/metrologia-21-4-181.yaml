abstract:
- content: "<p>The neutron emission rates of the UK national standard Ra-Be photoneutron
    source and a<sup>252</sup>Cf spontaneous fission source have been remeasured by
    the manganese sulphate bath technique. The measurements were performed as part
    of a dilution experiment in which the hydrogen-to-manganese capture-cross-section
    ratio was determined following replacement of the original manganese sulphate
    by purer material. The data have been subjected to rigorous analysis in which
    the correlations were treated by covariance matrices. These measurements confirm
    the re-evaluation of previously determined source emission rates published in
    1982. A value for the hydrogen-to-manganese capture-cross-section ratio of 0.02477
    Â± 0.00005 (one standard deviation) is recommended for use with other manganese
    baths and other neutron source spectra.</p>"
