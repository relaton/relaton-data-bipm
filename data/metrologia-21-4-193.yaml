  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A technique is described for the measurement of nuclear reaction <italic>Q</italic>-values
    with an accuracy of a few parts in 10<sup>5</sup>, in which the ultimate reference
    is a one-volt standard. As a test of the technique the accurately known threshold
    energy of the <sup>7</sup>Li(p, n)<sup>7</sup>Be reaction, 1880.51 ± 0.08 keV,
    has been remeasured. The value found using the present technique is 1880.443 ±
    0.020 keV, in good agreement with previous values. An attempt to see evidence
    for atomic excitation effects in the <sup>27</sup>A1(p,n)<sup>27</sup>Si reaction
    is also discussed. This yielded a new value of 5803.73 ± 0.12 keV for the threshold
    of this reaction, again in a good agreement with, but more accurate than, previous
    values. Further test measurements are summarized. The main application of the
    technique, in measurements related to the theory of weak interactions, is discussed
    briefly and the results obtained to date are presented.</p>"
