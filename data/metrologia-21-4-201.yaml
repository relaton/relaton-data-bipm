abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of 12 standard platinum resistance thermometers
    has been carried out at 59 temperatures between 13.81 K and 273.15 K. Included
    in the experiment were thermometers from a wider variety of sources than those
    in previous intercomparisons. The thermometers were calibrated on IPTS-68 and
    also using a single deviation function to cover the temperature range from 13.81
    K to 273.15 K. The differences between the thermometers calibrated on both schemes
    were related to, and compared with, those in a previous intercomparison and found
    to be not significantly different. The intercomparison provides further evidence
    for the universality of IPTS-68 and improved single-range interpolation schemes.</p>"
