  content: "<p>The ac and dc insulation resistance of two open-circuited, commercial,
    standard platinum resistance thermometers is investigated over the range 0-750
    °C and 2-4000 Hz, to determine the magnitude of temperature errors caused by the
    insulation shunt across the platinum sensor. It is found that ac insulation leakage
    is always greater than dc leakage; that ac leakage increases as the test frequency
    increases; and that both ac and dc leakage usually increase rapidly as the temperature
    increases above 500 °C. For example, the temperature errors at 630 °C caused by
    insulation leakage when a thermometer is measured with dc, 100 Hz and 1000 Hz
    excitation can reach about 1, 2 and 8 m °C respectively. With a metal-sheathed
    thermometer, it is confirmed experimentally that the more readily measured insulation
    resistance between the sheath and the leads gives a useful approximation to the
    true shunt across the sensor at high temperatures. Similarly, it is shown for
    a quartz-sheathed thermometer that the insulation resistance between the leads
    and a metal mesh placed over the sheath will also approximate the true shunt at
    high temperatures. Other properties investigated include: dc leakage as a function
    of the thermometer furnace immersion; ac leakage in a thermometer containing moist
    air; ac leakage in the external thermometer leads; and the ac capacitance of the
    thermometer and leads.</p>"
