    <p>The 1986 CPEM—the next in the series of biennial international conferences on electromagnetic metrology and related fundamental physical constants— will be held on June 23 through June 27, 1986, at the National Bureau of Standards, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. Sponsors are: NBS, the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society and the Union Radio Scientifique Internationale.</p><p>Papers describing original work, not previously published or presented, covering the theory, design, performance, simulation, or application of electromagnetic standards, measurements, techniques, instruments, or systems, are sought for presentation at CPEM '86.</p><p>Papers on absolute electrical measurements and the use of quantum phenomena as electrical standards are especially sought in preparation for the meeting late in 1986 of the Comité Consultatif D'Electricité of the CIPM to decide on the adoption of international values for the constants 2e/h and  h/e<sup>2</sup> for the definition of the volt and the ohm, respectively.</p><p>All papers concerned with electromagnetic measurements and standards and with related fundamental physics will be considered. Papers in the following fields are considered to be especially appropriate:<p>EM-related fundamental constants and standards</p><p>Direct current, low frequency, and RF</p><p>Time, time interval, and frequency</p><p>Antennas and fields</p><p>Microwaves and millimeter waves</p><p>Infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation</p><p>Lasers</p><p>Electro- and fibre optics</p><p>Cryo-electronics</p><p>Automated measurements</p><p>Technical calibration services.</p>

    The Conference language will be English. Authors should request an author's kit for the submission of a summary (500 to 1000 words) and abstract (maximum of 50 words) to be used to facilitate paper selection by the Program Committee. The summary must describe clearly the new and significant results and their importance. Summaries must be received on or before 1 February 1986 and should be sent to: Mr Norman B Belecki, Technical Program Chairman, CPEM '86, National Bureau of Standards, B146, METROLOGY, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.</p><p>Authors will be notified before 15 March 1986 whether their papers have been accepted and informed of the type of session to which they have been assigned and of the publication of their full papers in the  IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement conference issue. Only papers actually presented at the Conference will be published!</p><p>For further technical information contact: John R Sorrells, National Bureau of Standards, (301) 921-2727
    or Norman B Belecki,  National Bureau of Standards, (301) 921-2715.</p><p>For further general information contact: Judy Wilson, National Bureau of Standards, (301) 921-2721.</p>
