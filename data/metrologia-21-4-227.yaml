    <p>A listing of the latest of these preprints, and of recent relevant publications, is still being distributed periodically by the Office of Standard Reference Data of the United States' National Bureau of Standards. The editors, B N Taylor and D R Lide, point out that this listing of preprints provides a service, the success of which depends on the active cooperation of the scientific community. They therefore remind authors to send copies of their preprints, as early as is convenient, to: PPMFC, National Bureau of Standards, Bldg 220, Rm B 258, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, USA.</p>
    <p>This address is also the source of the listing and relevant information, but not the preprints themselves.
