abstract:
- content: "<p>It is argued that angles are geometric quantities and have a dimension.
    The equation giving the length s of the arc cut out by an angle φ on a circle
    of radius R is written as s = η R φ, where η is a universal constant relating
    translational and rotational mechanics.</p><p>Examples chosen in trigonometry
    and rotational mechanics show how a few equations can be rewritten so that all
    equations involve only quantities (including angles), and constants (such as η),
    and do not require the use of special units, such as the radian. Once angular
    dimensions have been properly incorporated in quantities and equations, it becomes
    clear, for example, that an angular frequency or velocity can be expressed in
    rad/s, or °/s, or rev/min. but not in Hz or s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>"
