    <p>A finite-element method was applied in designing a mechanical device for X-ray fringe scanning over a distance of about 50 Î¼m with a pitch angle of some milliseconds of arc.</p>
    <p>With this method it was possible to detect critical parameters in the hinges of the device, as well as points where the pitch angle is nil. A Zerodur prototype was constructed, and measurements carried out on it with an autocollimator confirmed that zero-pitch points were correctly predicted by the calculation programme.</p>
