abstract:
- content: "<p>A finite-element method was applied in designing a mechanical device
    for X-ray fringe scanning over a distance of about 50 Î¼m with a pitch angle of
    some milliseconds of arc.</p><p>With this method it was possible to detect critical
    parameters in the hinges of the device, as well as points where the pitch angle
    is nil. A Zerodur prototype was constructed, and measurements carried out on it
    with an autocollimator confirmed that zero-pitch points were correctly predicted
    by the calculation programme.</p>"
