abstract:
- content: "<p>It is proposed to establish a new astronomical time scale - the pulsar
    time scale (PT). This scale is based on the very stable periodicity of the pulse
    sequence of a pulsar radio emission. The most stable pulsars such as PSR 0834+06,
    0950+08, 1919+21 and the millisecond pulsar PSR 1937+214 are proposed as reference
    clocks for the new time scale. The pulsar time scale will keep both an interval
    and an epoch of the time and is more precise than existing UT and ET astronomical
    time scales.</p>"
