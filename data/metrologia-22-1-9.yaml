  content: "<p>This paper reports a precision measurement of the 2<sup>2</sup>S<sub>1/2</sub>-2<sup>2</sup>P<sub>1/2</sub>
    Lamb-shift interval in hydrogen. The fast-beam, separated-oscillatory-field technique
    was used to obtain resonances that were significantly narrower than the natural
    linewidth of the transition. The resonances were observed in zero magnetic field
    by varying the frequency of the microwave field. The final result, <italic>f</italic>
    (H, <italic>n</italic> = 2) = 1057.845(9) MHz, is in good agreement with other
    measurements of this interval. There is sufficient uncertainty in the theoretical
    value that one cannot make a definitive comparison with theory at the level of
    precision of this experiment.</p>"
