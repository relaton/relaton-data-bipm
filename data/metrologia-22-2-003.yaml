abstract:
- content: "<p>Advances in crystal growth technology together with advances in preferential
    etching techniques may make it possible to produce a nearly perfect single crystal
    of silicon in the form of a 111 tetrahedron. The density homogeneity of such an
    artifact together with the high precision to which its centre of mass could be
    located with respect to its faces would suggest its use as an attracting mass
    in experiments to determine the gravitational constant G. In this paper a closed-form
    expression for the gravitational field of a 111 tetrahedron is derived.</p>"
