abstract:
- content: "<p>Adsorption errors, caused mainly by water vapour, in the observed values
    in the calibration of the highest-quality mass standards have become significant.
    Adsorption corrections for various surface conditions of weights have not yet
    been established.</p><p>The propagation of adsorption errors to each calibrated
    value may be decreased by the improvement of weight series or weighing designs.
    But there is no measure to estimate the propagated errors.</p><p>There are two
    kinds of Equivalent Surface Area for adsorption (ESA) defined in this paper. One
    applies at constant humidity; the second, at fluctuating humidity. The first one
    depends upon the geometry of the weights used, the second one also depends upon
    the calibration scheme employed. Consequently the second ESA is proposed as a
    practical measure for conditions of fluctuating humidity.</p>"
