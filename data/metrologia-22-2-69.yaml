    <p>Adsorption errors, caused mainly by water vapour, in the observed values in the calibration of the highest-quality mass standards have become significant. Adsorption corrections for various surface conditions of weights have not yet been established.</p>
    <p>The propagation of adsorption errors to each calibrated value may be decreased by the improvement of weight series or weighing designs. But there is no measure to estimate the propagated errors.</p>
    <p>There are two kinds of Equivalent Surface Area for adsorption (ESA) defined in this paper. One applies at constant humidity; the second, at fluctuating humidity. The first one depends upon the geometry of the weights used, the second one also depends upon the calibration scheme employed. Consequently the second ESA is proposed as a practical measure for conditions of fluctuating humidity.</p>
