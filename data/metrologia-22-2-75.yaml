  content: "<p>The electron storage ring BESSY was investigated for use as a primary
    standard of spectral irradiance at wavelengths between 400 nm and 1000 nm. A method
    was devised to transfer the spectral irradiance scale realized on to tungsten
    halogen lamps by means of a radiometer that measured either the spectral irradiance
    of BESSY or that of the lamps. The relative systematic uncertainty of the spectral
    irradiance produced by the storage ring was determined to be 0.3%. Presently,
    the calibration of tungsten halogen lamps as radiometric transfer standards of
    spectral irradiance from synchrotron radiation yields a relative systematic uncertainty
    of 0.8%, which is below the uncertainty that is currently achieved using black-body
    radiators. Spectral irradiances of tungsten halogen lamps measured by means of
    synchrotron radiation and by means of black-body radiation agree within the combined
    uncertainties of the two methods. We conclude from the investigations that a reduction
    of the uncertainty of the spectral irradiance of the storage ring to approximately
    0.1% can be achieved if it seems worthwhile. Also, the uncertainty in the calibration
    of the spectral irradiance of tungsten halogen lamps could be reduced below 0.5%
    if desired.</p>"
