abstract:
- content: "<p>The theory of the thermal boundary layer at the walls of a spherical
    acoustic resonator is discussed in detail. For gases at low pressures, the temperature-jump
    effect is found to make a significant contribution to the resonance frequencies
    of the radial modes but not to their acoustic losses. Experimental results are
    reported for argon at 273.16 K and pressures between 15 and 248 kPa, and compared
    with the theory. These were obtained using the four radial modes with lowest frequency
    of a spherical resonator with a radius of 60 mm. The thermal accommodation coefficient
    between argon and the aluminium wall of the resonator was found to be (0.84 ±
    0.05). The results suggest that a determination of the gas constant with a fractional
    imprecision of 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> or better should be possible using a spherical
    acoustic resonator.</p>"
