abstract:
- content: "<p>Resonant excitation of ion oscillations in static traps with superimposed
    magnetic fields leads to narrow resonances. The ratio of these resonances for
    different ions gives directly the mass ratio of the ions without precise knowledge
    of the electric and magnetic fields. A measurement of the proton-electron mass
    ratio with an uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> has been performed at the University
    of Mainz. Extension to other masses and imprecisions down to 10<sup>-9</sup> are
    discussed.</p>"
