abstract:
- content: '<p>This volume contains the papers presented at the 70th PTB Seminar which,
    the second on the subject "Fundamental Constants in Physics and Metrology", was
    held at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig from October
    21 to 22, 1985. About 100 participants from the universities and various research
    institutes of the Federal Republic of Germany participated in the meeting. Besides
    a number of review lectures on various broader subjects there was a poster session
    which contained a variety of topical contributed papers ranging from the theory
    of the quantum Hall effect to reports on the status of the metrological experiments
    at the PTB. In addition, the participants were also offered the possibility to
    visit the PTB laboratories during the course of the seminar.</p><p>During the
    preparation of the meeting we noticed that even most of the general subjects which
    were going to be discussed in the lectures are of great importance in connection
    with metrological experiments and should be made accessible to the scientific
    community. This eventually resulted in the idea of the publication of the papers
    in a regular journal. We are grateful to the editor of Metrologia for providing
    this opportunity.</p><p>We have included quite a number of papers from basic physical
    research. For example, certain aspects of high-energy physics and quantum optics,
    as well as the many-faceted role of Sommerfeld''s fine-structure constant, are
    covered. We think that questions such as "What are the intrinsic fundamental parameters
    of nature?" or "What are we doing when we perform an experiment?" can shed new
    light on the art of metrology, and do, potentially, lead to new ideas. This appears
    to be especially necessary when we notice the increasing importance of the role
    of the fundamental constants and macroscopic quantum effects for the definition
    and the realization of the physical units. In some cases we have reached a point
    where the limitations of our knowledge of a fundamental constant and/or a physical
    unit have their origin in the shortcomings of our understanding of the underlying
    physics rather than being due to the technical problems in the experiment. In
    this context, it is worth mentioning that the quantum Hall effect, the discovery
    of which by Klaus von Klitzing was rewarded only recently by the Nobel Prize for
    physics, still needs further attention. We are able to reproduce experimentally
    resistances with an extremely high precision using this effect. Nevertheless,
    we have severe difficulties in our present physical understanding of the mechanism
    which provides the plateaux in the Hall resistance.</p><p>Lectures on "Quantum
    Non-Demolition" and "Determination of the Boltzmann Constant" have been included
    in order to show routes to "new frontiers" in metrology. Even the "conventional"
    metrological concepts, when combined with modern technology, can provide surprises:
    Although the Josephson effect is known since 1962, it was only recently that a
    quantized voltage in the 1-volt range could be experimentally realized. The experiment
    was performed by making use of modern thin-film technology. In addition to providing
    a simple and precise voltage standard in a practically important regime it also
    sets a new frontier in precision electrical metrology by demonstrating that, ultimately,
    the reproducibility of the unit of voltage is limited by that of the unit of time.</p><p>We
    are indebted to a number of people who helped to organize the Seminar as well
    as to prepare this volume. Especially, we would like to mention Mrs Inge Bode.
    Without her continuous work the 70th PTB Seminar would not have been possible
    in the way we all have experienced it. We appreciate also the help of R P Hudson
    and H Lotsch in achieving a fast publication of this volume. Financial support
    from the Helmholtz-Fond is gratefully acknowledged.</p>'
