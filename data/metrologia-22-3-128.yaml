abstract:
- content: "<p>No measurement is possible without any theory. With respect to a theory
    under consideration one has to distinguish between direct and indirect measurements.
    Direct measurements are defined by pre-theories, i.e. without the theory under
    consideration. The direct measurements for quantum theory are given by measurable
    processes on macroscopic devices. It is demonstrated how indirect measurements
    in quantum mechanics can be reduced to direct measurements. A theory of the measuring
    device is in this context not possible by quantum mechanics alone, but by a more
    comprehensive theory of macrosystems.</p>"
