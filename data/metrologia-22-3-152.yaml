abstract:
- content: "<p>The Hall current is calculated for a finite system with cylindrical
    geometry. The dependence of the current on the size of the system and the electric
    field is studied. The results indicate that the current vanishes in the thermodynamic
    limit, as does the conductivity.</p>"
