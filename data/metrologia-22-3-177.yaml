abstract:
- content: <p>In this paper we discuss the various aspects of the interrelations among
    the SI units of physics and fundamental constants.</p><p>In the first part (Sects.
    I to III) the progress in precision for the fundamental constants achieved in
    the last ten years will be given. The time dependence of the "best" values for
    α and h/(2e) is demonstrated and discussed, based on least-squares adjustments
    of the set of fundamental constants since 1952.</p><p>In the second part (Sect.
    IV to VII) the SI units of physics are discussed from the point of view of fundamental
    constants. Particularly the electrical science has profited by the advent of the
    macroscopic quantum phenomena of the ac Josephson effect and the quantum Hall
    effect. The limits for precision measurements of quantized voltages and resistances
    are investigated as well as the implications of the two quantum effects for several
    SI units of electrical energy, luminous intensity, temperature and electrical
    resistance. Finally, a conceivable future system of units entirely based on fundamental
    constants is suggested and its chances for introduction are discussed.</p>
