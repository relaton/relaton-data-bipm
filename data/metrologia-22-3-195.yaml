  content: "<p>During the recent past much effort has been spent on cooling of neutral
    atomic beams. As a result, two successful experimental methods for laser cooling
    of atomic beams were developed with post-cooling temperatures in the mK regime.
    We discuss in which ways these cooled atomic beams and new methods for further
    cooling and handling of these slow atomic beams could improve present and future
    frequency standards.</p>"
