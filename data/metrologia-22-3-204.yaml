abstract:
- content: "<p>The SI unit of current, the ampere, may be realized by combining the
    results of two different NMR experiments observing the precession frequencies
    of some nuclei. In contrast to the well-known methods used in some metrology institutes
    we suggest referring the magnetic flux densities produced by quite different coil
    arrangements in the two experiments to one coil, thus eliminating the first-order
    influence of its geometrical dimensions.</p>"
