abstract:
- content: "<p>A description is given of the measuring system set up at the PTB for
    the realization of the SI volt and the determination of the conversion factor
    K<sub>v</sub> by means of a voltage balance. The voltage balance comprises two
    cylindrical electrodes to generate the electrostatic force from the measuring
    voltage of 10.186 kV, and a substitution balance to measure the force by comparison
    with the force due to gravity acting on a 2 g mass. To achieve force equilibrium
    a small variable voltage is added to the constant measuring voltage. The measuring
    voltage is generated in a two-stage 1000-fold step-up and linked up with the asmaintained
    volt by using a transfer standard consisting of 10 saturated standard cells connected
    in series. The total relative uncertainty of K<sub>v</sub> is expected to be less
    than 4 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>"
