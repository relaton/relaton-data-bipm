  content: "<p>A description is given of the measuring system set up at the PTB for
    the realization of the SI volt and the determination of the conversion factor
    <italic>K</italic><sub>v</sub> by means of a voltage balance. The voltage balance
    comprises two cylindrical electrodes to generate the electrostatic force from
    the measuring voltage of 10.186 kV, and a substitution balance to measure the
    force by comparison with the force due to gravity acting on a 2 g mass. To achieve
    force equilibrium a small variable voltage is added to the constant measuring
    voltage. The measuring voltage is generated in a two-stage 1000-fold step-up and
    linked up with the asmaintained volt by using a transfer standard consisting of
    10 saturated standard cells connected in series. The total relative uncertainty
    of <italic>K</italic><sub>v</sub> is expected to be less than 4 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>.</p>"
