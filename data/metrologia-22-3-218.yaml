    <p>The investigations carried out in establishing a standard for high voltages are summarized. The method is based on electron-speed filtering using a superconducting rectangular resonator. Due to the calculable interaction of the accelerated electrons and the microwave field inside the resonator, only electrons with well-defined velocities can pass through the resonator via small apertures in the front and rear faces. Thus the realization of discrete calibration voltages is referred to the measurement of resonant frequencies in the GHz range and to the knowledge of <italic>e</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>0</sub>.</p>
    <p>In the range between 40 kV and 90 kV, five calibration voltages were obtained. The relative uncertainty was estimated to be 1.2 Ã— 10<sup>-4</sup>. As a result of several improvements to be made in the experimental set-up, a relative uncertainty of a few parts in 10<sup>5</sup> is expected. The standard will then be used for the calibration of high-voltage dividers. In principle, the method for establishing high dc voltages may also be applied to ac voltages, yielding the true peak value.</p>
