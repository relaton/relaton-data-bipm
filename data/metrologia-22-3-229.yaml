abstract:
- content: "<p>The metrological background of a precision determination of the Boltzmann
    constant k is outlined. k can be determined indirectly by measuring the gas constant
    R<sub>0</sub> or the Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ. The measuring procedures are
    briefly described. k can also be determined directly by measuring the thermal
    noise of a resistor. A not-yet-quite-completed equipment is described and a thorough
    theoretical analysis of the measuring procedure is given.</p>"
