abstract:
- content: <p>In the second half of 1985 we experienced an unusually high submission
    rate of articles, which event, while being highly desirable in itself, has caused
    something of a problem. The economics of this journal is such that these could
    not be absorbed, thereby avoiding unusual delays in publishing, by simply increasing
    the number of printed pages for 1986. After considerable discussion between myself
    and the publishers, the best solution appeared to be to publish two 4-issue volumes
    in "1987" and to bring 2 issues of the first of those volumes forward so as to
    actually appear towards the end of 1986. To do nothing would incur a sudden, rather
    drastic increase in publication-delay which would take a very long time to dissipate.</p><p>The
    introduction of a second volume in 1987 must result, regrettably, in a doubling
    of the subscription price for that year. That will be, fortunately, a one-time
    phenomenon and I hope that our subscribers will be able to tolerate it and will
    remain loyally supportive. [One should perhaps add, by way of clarification, that
    the appearance of the special issue 1986 (3), while contributing to the aforementioned
    problem, only did so to the extent of a single issue and offers "compensation"
    by being over twice the normal size.] In fact, it is not unreasonable to hope
    for wider support in the years ahead, given the uniqueness of this journal (now
    in its 22nd year of publication), the importance of its role in measurement science,
    its wide coverage of topics and the very high quality of its articles.</p>
