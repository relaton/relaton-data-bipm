abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes new decimal weight series effective for submultiples
    of mass standards. In order to decrease the influence of adsorption on weight
    surfaces by reduction of the difference in surface area between weights or assembled
    weights to be compared, it is better in the case of weight series with components
    of similar shape that fewer components be involved in a comparison. Weight series
    are found which will enable us to establish mass standards by only \"Simple Comparisons\"
    (SCs), which latter are confined to intercomparisons between single weights or
    assembled weights composed of at most two components. SC also saves time and labour
    in the setting of weights on a balance pan.</p><p>The least number of components
    per decade is five and under such a condition six new series are disclosed:</p><p>\n
    \n\nS 1: (6, 4, 3, 2, 1)\nS 2: (6, 5, 3, 2, 1)\n\n\nS 3: (7, 4, 3, 2, 1)\nS 4:
    (7, 5, 4, 2, 1)\n\n\nS 5: (7, 6, 3, 2, 1)\nS 6: (8, 5, 4, 2, 1).</p><p>These series
    have additional practical merits: all components are distinct from each other
    and all integers in a decade are made by at most two components.</p>"
