    <p>This paper describes new decimal weight series effective for submultiples of mass standards. In order to decrease the influence of adsorption on weight surfaces by reduction of the difference in surface area between weights or assembled weights to be compared, it is better in the case of weight series with components of similar shape that fewer components be involved in a comparison. Weight series are found which will enable us to establish mass standards by only "Simple Comparisons" (SCs), which latter are confined to intercomparisons between single weights or assembled weights composed of at most two components. SC also saves time and labour in the setting of weights on a balance pan.</p>
    <p>The least number of components per decade is five and under such a condition six new series are disclosed:</p>
    <p>
                   <table-wrap orientation="portrait" position="float"><table>
    <tr>
    <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">S 1: (6, 4, 3, 2, 1)</td>
    <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">S 2: (6, 5, 3, 2, 1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">S 3: (7, 4, 3, 2, 1)</td>
    <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">S 4: (7, 5, 4, 2, 1)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">S 5: (7, 6, 3, 2, 1)</td>
    <td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1" valign="top">S 6: (8, 5, 4, 2, 1).</td>
    </tr>
    </table></table-wrap></p>
    <p>These series have additional practical merits: all components are distinct from each other and all integers in a decade are made by at most two components.</p>
