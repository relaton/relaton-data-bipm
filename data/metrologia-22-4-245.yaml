    <p>Angle can be made dimensional by introducing a universal constant into its definition, so that linear-and rotary-action quantities then have different dimensions. However, to offset this gain, extensive changes will be required in the educational system. The view is put that the confusion surrounding angle will be more easily dispelled by making clear that radians, degrees, revolutions, etc. do not designate different units of the same quantity, but definitions of different, but related, quantities, all of which are dimensionless.</p>
    <p>With respect to dimensional analysis, examples are used to show that treating angle as dimensional does not generally lead to correct results. Rather, it is best to avoid the use of angles in describing systems for dimensional analysis, using appropriate lengths instead.</p>
