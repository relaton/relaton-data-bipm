abstract:
- content: "<p>Angle can be made dimensional by introducing a universal constant into
    its definition, so that linear-and rotary-action quantities then have different
    dimensions. However, to offset this gain, extensive changes will be required in
    the educational system. The view is put that the confusion surrounding angle will
    be more easily dispelled by making clear that radians, degrees, revolutions, etc.
    do not designate different units of the same quantity, but definitions of different,
    but related, quantities, all of which are dimensionless.</p><p>With respect to
    dimensional analysis, examples are used to show that treating angle as dimensional
    does not generally lead to correct results. Rather, it is best to avoid the use
    of angles in describing systems for dimensional analysis, using appropriate lengths
    instead.</p>"
