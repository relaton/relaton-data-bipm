    <p>A list of accurate frequency measurements made on laser-based frequency standards in the 10 THz to 580 THz region is assembled and discussed. The list contains all known results with accuracy exceeding 3 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with the added constraint for the 30 THz region that only those linked directly to the caesium standard are included.</p>
    <p>The frequencies of stabilized lasers recommended for the implementation of the 1983 definition of the metre are shown for comparison.</p>
