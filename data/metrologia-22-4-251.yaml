abstract:
- content: "<p>A list of accurate frequency measurements made on laser-based frequency
    standards in the 10 THz to 580 THz region is assembled and discussed. The list
    contains all known results with accuracy exceeding 3 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with
    the added constraint for the 30 THz region that only those linked directly to
    the caesium standard are included.</p><p>The frequencies of stabilized lasers
    recommended for the implementation of the 1983 definition of the metre are shown
    for comparison.</p>"
