  content: "<p>The radial and axial distortions of a piston and a cylinder are calculated
    from exact solutions of the elastic differential equations in the case of a pressure
    distribution <italic>p(z)</italic> = α + β<italic>z</italic> + γ<italic>z</italic><sup>2</sup>
    in the clearance between the piston and cylinder. The outer curved surface of
    the cylinder is assumed to be exposed to a constant pressure <italic>p</italic><sub>j</sub>.
    The end faces of the piston are subjected to the gauge pressure <italic>p</italic><sub>o</sub>
    and to the gravitational force exerted by the load that creates the pressure <italic>p</italic><sub>o</sub>.
    A pressure <italic>p</italic><sub>ce</sub> is assumed to act on the end faces
    of the cylinder. From the results, the distortion coefficient of the pistoncylinder
    system is calculated using the formula given by Dadson, Greig and Horner.</p>"
