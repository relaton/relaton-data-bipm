abstract:
- content: "<p>The radial and axial distortions of a piston and a cylinder are calculated
    from exact solutions of the elastic differential equations in the case of a pressure
    distribution p(z) = α + βz + γz<sup>2</sup> in the clearance between the piston
    and cylinder. The outer curved surface of the cylinder is assumed to be exposed
    to a constant pressure p<sub>j</sub>. The end faces of the piston are subjected
    to the gauge pressure p<sub>o</sub> and to the gravitational force exerted by
    the load that creates the pressure p<sub>o</sub>. A pressure p<sub>ce</sub> is
    assumed to act on the end faces of the cylinder. From the results, the distortion
    coefficient of the pistoncylinder system is calculated using the formula given
    by Dadson, Greig and Horner.</p>"
