abstract:
- content: "<p>From a mathematical model of a three-body absorbed-dose calorimeter
    a procedure for achieving thermal equilibrium is developed which uses calculational
    methods to determine the exact amount and timing of electrical energy to be dissipated
    in the calorimetric bodies. This procedure is applied to the quasi-isothermal
    mode of operation in which a radiation beam and equivalent electrical heating
    are alternately used to keep the calorimetric bodies at temperatures as constant
    as possible. Measurements of the dose rate of a<sup>60</sup>Co beam in graphite
    using this technique are reported.</p>"
