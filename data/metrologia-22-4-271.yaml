  content: "<p>Electromagnetic trapping of neutral atoms is a new branch of applied
    physics that has potential for use in very many areas, including metrology and
    high-resolution precision spectroscopy. It has the possibility of leading toward
    the spectroscopic ideal of an isolated atom at rest, available for interaction
    with electromagnetic field probes. We present an introduction to trapping in both
    dc magnetic fields and optical fields (laser beams). The basic ideas and fundamental
    limitations are discussed and the first successful experiments are reviewed.</p>"
