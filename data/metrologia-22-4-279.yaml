abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparisons have been carried out between interference refractometers
    built in different countries. Individual measurements of the refractive index
    of air have been made using air from the same sample volume. Direct comparison
    of refractometers was realized by coupling the instruments to the same air-inlet
    system.</p><p>In order to compare the measured results the refractive index was
    also calculated from accurate measured values of pressure, temperature, humidity
    and CO<sub>2</sub> content, using Edl√©n's formula. Most of the individual measurements
    show an agreement within 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> while direct comparisons show
    an agreement within 5 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. Over a period of five days an increase
    in CO<sub>2</sub> content of 400 ppm per day was measured in a 300 m<sup>3</sup>
    laboratory room. The results show the great importance of correcting calculated
    results for the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the air.</p>"
