    <p>Comparisons have been carried out between interference refractometers built in different countries. Individual measurements of the refractive index of air have been made using air from the same sample volume. Direct comparison of refractometers was realized by coupling the instruments to the same air-inlet system.</p>
    <p>In order to compare the measured results the refractive index was also calculated from accurate measured values of pressure, temperature, humidity and CO<sub>2</sub> content, using Edl√©n's formula. Most of the individual measurements show an agreement within 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> while direct comparisons show an agreement within 5 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. Over a period of five days an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> content of 400 ppm per day was measured in a 300 m<sup>3</sup> laboratory room. The results show the great importance of correcting calculated results for the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the air.</p>
