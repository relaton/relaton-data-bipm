abstract:
- content: "<p>A pyrometric method and appropriate black bodies are described for
    the accurate measurement of thermodynamic temperature above 683 K (410 °C). The
    pyrometer employs unbiased low-noise silicon detectors of linear response and
    a dielectric multi-cavity interference filter of 40 nm halfwidth with a sharply-edged
    band pass. The effective wavelength equals about 974 nm. Special emphasis has
    been given to determine and to minimize the errors due to temperature gradients
    inside a black body that is controlled to a very stable temperature T<sub>68</sub>
    utilizing platinum resistance thermometers.</p><p>The difference ΔT = T - T<sub>68</sub>
    between thermodynamic and practical temperatures at the antimony point (630.74
    °C) was measured to be - 0.150 K ± 22 mK. From 683 K to 903 K the difference ΔT
    is expressed by the empirical least-squares fit ΔT = T - T<sub>68</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>
    + a<sub>2</sub> T<sub>68</sub>; a<sub>1</sub> = 0.2154 K; a<sub>2</sub> = - 0.4038
    × 10<sup>-3</sup>. The thermodynamic temperature of the aluminium point has been
    determined as 933.452 K ± 24 mK. The overall uncertainties are given at the 99%
    confidence level.</p>"
