abstract:
- content: "<p>A new technique for evaluating the velocity distribution in cesium-beam
    frequency standards is presented. It is based on the dependence of the amplitude
    of the central maximum of the Ramsey resonance on the exciting microwave power
    level. The second-order Doppler shift, typically Δ f/f  ≃ 4 × 10<sup>-13</sup>
    for the NRC primary standards, can be evaluated by this method with an uncertainty
    of about 10<sup>-15</sup>, five times the precision attainable previously.</p>"
