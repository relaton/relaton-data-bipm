    <p>Gas-thermometer measurements between 4 K and 100 K have been performed at the Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory as part of the preparatory work in several institutes for a future, revised, International Practical Temperature Scale. Gas-thermometer temperatures are compared, between 13.8 K and 100 K, with platinum resistance thermometers calibrated on IPTS-68 and, between 4.2 K and 27.1 K, with rhodium-iron resistance thermometers calibrated on the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington) Scale of 1975 (NPL-75).</p>
    <p>Results of the measurements, with NPL-75 at 20.3 K as a reference temperature for the gas thermometer, show agreement with NPL-75 within 0.3 mK over most of the range. Differences from NPL-75 of 0.6 mK were found in the range 10 K to 14 K and around 27 K.</p>
    <p>Below 50 K, IPTS-68 is shown to be 4 mK to 10 mK higher than thermodynamic temperatures. Between 70 K and 100 K, IPTS-68 is 9 mK lower than thermodynamic temperatures.</p>
