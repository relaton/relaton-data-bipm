    <p>A pyrometric method and appropriate black bodies are described for the accurate measurement of thermodynamic temperature above 683 K (410 °C). The pyrometer employs unbiased low-noise silicon detectors of linear response and a dielectric multi-cavity interference filter of 40 nm halfwidth with a sharply-edged band pass. The effective wavelength equals about 974 nm. Special emphasis has been given to determine and to minimize the errors due to temperature gradients inside a black body that is controlled to a very stable temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub> utilizing platinum resistance thermometers.</p>
    <p>The difference Δ<italic>T = T - T</italic><sub>68</sub> between thermodynamic and practical temperatures at the antimony point (630.74 °C) was measured to be - 0.150 K ± 22 mK. From 683 K to 903 K the difference Δ<italic>T</italic> is expressed by the empirical least-squares fit Δ<italic>T = T - T</italic><sub>68</sub> = <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> <italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub>; <italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.2154 K; <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub> = - 0.4038 × 10<sup>-3</sup>. The thermodynamic temperature of the aluminium point has been determined as 933.452 K ± 24 mK. The overall uncertainties are given at the 99% confidence level.</p>
