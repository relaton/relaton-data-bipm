abstract:
- content: "<p>A constant-volume gas thermometer has been used to measure the thermodynamic
    temperature, and also the second virial coefficient of helium 4, at the triple
    point of neon (24.5 K). This was carried out by measuring a relative isotherm
    at 24.5 K referenced to the temperature of the boiling point of hydrogen on the
    NPL75 temperature scale. The thermodynamic temperature values measured for the
    triple points of natural neon and neon 20 were (24.557<sub>0</sub> ± 0.001<sub>1</sub>)
    K and (24.539<sub>4</sub> ± 0.001<sub>1</sub>) K respectively. The result for
    natural neon agrees well with the corresponding temperature value of (24.556<sub>5</sub>
    ± 0.001<sub>1</sub>) K inferred from NPL75 and may be related to other laboratory
    realizations of the neon triple point through the recent international intercomparison
    of sealed triple-point cells.</p>"
