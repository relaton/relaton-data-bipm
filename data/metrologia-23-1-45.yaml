abstract:
- content: "<p>A He-Ne laser at λ = 612 nm, stabilized to saturated absorption features
    of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> in an external cell [and with no cell inside the
    laser cavity] is presented. The successive-2-sample deviation for an averaging
    time of 10 s is not larger than 0.15 kHz or 3 × 10<sup>-13</sup> of the laser
    frequency. The uncertainty of the laser frequency due to variations of the laser
    power or of the beam geometry is less than 5 kHz. But dramatic frequency shifts
    occur when the returning beam touches an obstacle. Single and multiple linear-regression
    analyses of the pressure and modulation dependence seem to offer a measure of
    the reproducibility and of technical or physical perturbations. Linewidth and
    asymmetry of the peaks have been studied, and the frequency differences of 9 hyperfine
    components have been determined.</p>"
