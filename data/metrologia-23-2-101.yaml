  content: "<p>The frequency of the He-Ne laser radiation stabilized by saturated
    absorption of methane in an internal cell (λ = 3.39 μm) can vary up to several
    kilohertz when the operating conditions of the amplifying tube are varied. Moreover,
    a different frequency is observed depending upon whether the photodetector used
    for servo-control is placed on the absorption-cell side or the amplifying-tube
    side of the resonator.</p>"
