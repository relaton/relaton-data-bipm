  content: "<p>In a recent paper by A J F Metherell and T J Quinn, <italic>The Gravitational
    Field of a 111 Tetrahedron</italic> (1986 Metrologia <bold>22</bold> 87-91), some
    typographical and other errors appeared. In this note these are corrected and
    suggestions made that might aid in the reading of the article and in use of the
    equations presented therein. The results of further calculations, made using double-precision
    arithmetic, are given, which clarify the behaviour of the field near the apices
    and the edges of the tetrahedron. An analytical expression is given for the field
    at the apices.</p>"
