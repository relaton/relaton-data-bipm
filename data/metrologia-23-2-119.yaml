abstract:
- content: "<p>In a recent paper by A J F Metherell and T J Quinn, The Gravitational
    Field of a 111 Tetrahedron (1986 Metrologia 22 87-91), some typographical and
    other errors appeared. In this note these are corrected and suggestions made that
    might aid in the reading of the article and in use of the equations presented
    therein. The results of further calculations, made using double-precision arithmetic,
    are given, which clarify the behaviour of the field near the apices and the edges
    of the tetrahedron. An analytical expression is given for the field at the apices.</p>"
