  content: "<p>The construction of a constant-volume gas thermometer for use between
    10 K and 300 K is described. The thermometer features gas-flow temperature control
    and the capability for continuous operation. Relative PV isotherms giving values
    for thermodynamic temperature and the second virial coefficient for <sup>4</sup>He
    were measured at 27 K, 43 K, 54 K, 63 K and 84 K referenced to 20 K on NPL-75
    and at 172 K referenced to 273.15 K. Further measurements at the isotherm temperatures
    referenced to 273.15 K were used to redetermine the reference temperature at 20
    K. Constant-volume gas-thermometry measurements were carried out at 72 temperatures
    between 13.81 K to 287 K. The results agree well with NPL-75 from 13.81 K to 27.1
    K but differ from IPTS-68 significantly from 27.1 K to 273.15 K.</p>"
