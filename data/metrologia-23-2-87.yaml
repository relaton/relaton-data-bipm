  content: "<p>This paper describes the design and construction of a novel form of
    equal-arm balance. The balance has been designed to study the performance of flexure
    strips for use as pivots in a 1 kg mass comparator working at the highest accuracy.
    The beam of the balance is servo controlled using optical detection of angular
    position and electromagnetic control. Small mass differences are measured in terms
    of the differences in the servo currents required to reproduce the same position
    of the beam. Preliminary results using this prototype balance indicate that an
    accuracy in mass comparison of about 5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> can be achieved.</p>"
