abstract:
- content: "<p>The procedure used at NPL for the routine filling of iodine cells is
    described, along with standard methods employed for the verification of the cells.
    Results show that a small proportion of the cells filled have significant contamination
    present. Detailed spectral analysis of these cells identifies the contaminants
    as primarily N<sub>2</sub> and CO. It is also shown that contaminated cells can
    be temporarily improved by an extended period of radio-frequency discharge.</p>"
