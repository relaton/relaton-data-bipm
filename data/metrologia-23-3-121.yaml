  content: "<p>This report deals with the results of an international intercomparison
    of attenuation in waveguide R 140 (WG 18, WR 62) at the frequency 15 GHz, which
    was decided and organized by the RF working group of the Comité Consultatif d'Electricité
    of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM). Its official designation
    is GT-RF 75-A 3. Five national institutes participated: IENGF (Italy), NBS (USA),
    OMH (Hungary), RSRE (UK) and PTB (Federal Republic of Germany) which acted as
    pilot laboratory. The five travelling standards - developed and made available
    by the participants - have the nominal attenuation values 0.01 dB, 0.1 dB, 10
    dB, 20 dB and 40 dB. The essential design principles and a short description of
    the measuring methods are given. The measurement results are presented in several
    tables and diagrams, followed by a discussion. The total uncertainties varied
    between ± 0.0002 dB (at 0.01 dB) and almost ± 0.1 dB (at 40 dB in the worst case).
    Apart from the 10 dB travelling standard all others exhibited excellent repeatability
    and a good long-term behaviour.</p>"
