  content: "<p>This is a report of an international comparison of determinations of
    neutron-source emission rates. Contributions received from fourteen laboratories
    describing emission-rate measurements of three sources by four different methods
    are analysed by a least-squares minimization procedure to determine the best values
    for the three emission rates and for the residual differences in the measured
    values. The residual differences are considerably reduced when the input values
    are normalized to a common set of standard cross-sections and to a common basis
    for the calculation of corrections.</p>"
