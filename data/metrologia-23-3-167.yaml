abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper discusses a method for measuring the gyromagnetic ratio of
    protons in a spherical water sample in terms of the quantum of magnetic flux.
    Combining this quantity with more accurately determined constants: the proton
    magnetic moment in terms of the Bohr magneton, and the Rydberg constant, as well
    as the velocity of light, would yield an improved experimental value for the fine-structure
    constant.</p>"
