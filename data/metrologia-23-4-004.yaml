abstract:
- content: "<p>Although the IPTS-68 is meant to be a close approximation to thermodynamic
    temperatures, its definition makes no provision for continuity in dt/dt<sub>68</sub>
    at 630.74°C. Any discontinuity in dt/dt<sub>68</sub> at 630.74°C is directly related
    to the corresponding discontinuity in the first derivative with respect to t<sub>68</sub>
    of sensor output, so the former can be obtained from measurement of the latter.
    The magnitude of the discontinuity has not previously been measured precisely;
    it has an important bearing on elucidating the behaviour of (t - t<sub>68</sub>)
    near 630.74°C. Over the temperature range from about 610°C to 645°C two calibrated
    platinum resistance thermometers, nine platinum - 10% rhodium/platinum thermocouples,
    and two other types of thermocouples have been intercompared in an experimental
    arrangement designed expressly to measure the discontinuity. The result for the
    relative discontinuity in dt/dt<sub>68</sub> at 630.74°C was found to be 0.51
    ± 0.10 percent.</p>"
