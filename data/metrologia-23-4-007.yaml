abstract:
- content: "<p>It is recommended that the term cycle (abbreviation cy) be introduced
    as a supplementary SI unit and that cycle and radian be used where appropriate
    to complete the SI units of quantities such as ν and ω, h and h, λ and λ̄. This
    would resolve a current and increasing confusion resulting from the misuse of
    such symbols as ω (as frequency) and λ̄ (as wavelength) in solid state physics
    and spectroscopy. This proposal would also assist the visualization of the processes
    represented by certain equations.</p>"
