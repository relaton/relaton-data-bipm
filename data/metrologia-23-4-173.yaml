  content: <p>The temperature characteristics of the same two glass triple-point cells
    containing well purified samples of 1,3-dioxolan-2-one have been studied at NPL
    and NBS. Triple-point temperatures measured on "mushes" under near-equilibrium
    conditions were found to be more reproducible than those measured during continuous
    cooling or heating through the phase transition. The results from the mush experiments,
    using measurements taken with a variety of standard platinum resistance thermometers,
    proved that realizations of IPTS-68 in the two national laboratories agree to
    within 0.3 mK at 36 °C, in accord with the expectations of the Comité Consultatif
    de Thermométrie. After being corrected for the effect of residual impurities in
    the sample and of the hydrostatic head, the mean value of the triple-point temperature
    of the substance is 36.3238 °C, with an overall uncertainty (1 σ) of 0.0004 °C.</p>
