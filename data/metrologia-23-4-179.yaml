  content: "<p>Laser-produced tungsten plasmas were investigated with respect to their
    suitability as radiometric transfer standard sources in the range between 7 nm
    and 100 nm. For plasma generation a Nd:YAG/glass laser system with λ = 1.064 μm,
    a pulse length of 17 ns and pulse energies between 100 mJ and 800 mJ was used
    in connection with a focusing system of 85 mm focal length. The spectral concentration
    of radiant intensity time-integrated over one plasma radiation pulse was measured
    with a relative uncertainty of 8% using the electron storage ring BESSY as a primary
    standard. Within this uncertainty the radiant emission was reproducible during
    several months, if one applied specific procedures that had been developed for
    setting the laser parameters and the focusing conditions. The maximum of emission
    was found at 16.5 nm. At this wavelength a 800 mJ laser pulse generates 3.5 ×
    10<sup>14</sup> photons nm<sup>-1</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup>. The results of this study
    let us expect that a small transportable radiation standard is practical, which
    is based on a low-cost, single-stage, Nd-laser system.</p>"
