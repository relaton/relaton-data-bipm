abstract:
- content: "<p>The accurate generation of gauge pressures in the range from below
    0.5 Pa to 2000 Pa using twin gas-operated pressure balances is described. Each
    gauge pressure is generated by changing the mass on one of the pressure balances
    while they are both operating. The performance of the twin-pressure-balance instrument
    was assessed by calibrating differential pressure transducers. The short-term
    stability of the average difference in pressure between the two pressure balances
    was about 0.5 mPa (standard deviation), or 5 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> of the line
    pressure, and the overall uncertainty (99% confidence limits) in the generated
    gauge pressure p<sub>e</sub> was ± (0.9 mPa + 2 × 10<sup>-5</sup> p<sub>e</sub>).</p>"
