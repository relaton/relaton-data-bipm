  content: "<p>Although the IPTS-68 is meant to be a close approximation to thermodynamic
    temperatures, its definition makes no provision for continuity in d<italic>t</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>68</sub>
    at 630.74°C. Any discontinuity in d<italic>t</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>68</sub>
    at 630.74°C is directly related to the corresponding discontinuity in the first
    derivative with respect to <italic>t</italic><sub>68</sub> of sensor output, so
    the former can be obtained from measurement of the latter. The magnitude of the
    discontinuity has not previously been measured precisely; it has an important
    bearing on elucidating the behaviour of (<italic>t - t</italic><sub>68</sub>)
    near 630.74°C. Over the temperature range from about 610°C to 645°C two calibrated
    platinum resistance thermometers, nine platinum - 10% rhodium/platinum thermocouples,
    and two other types of thermocouples have been intercompared in an experimental
    arrangement designed expressly to measure the discontinuity. The result for the
    relative discontinuity in d<italic>t</italic>/d<italic>t</italic><sub>68</sub>
    at 630.74°C was found to be 0.51 ± 0.10 percent.</p>"
