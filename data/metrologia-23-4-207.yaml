abstract:
- content: "<p>The observation, by Kozdon, Dammermann and Wagenbreth, of a minimum
    at 3 °C in the density change when water is saturated with air has been investigated
    by a magnetic float technique. The results presented for the range 0-8 °C do not
    confirm this minimum nor an earlier one reported by Marek whose results have been
    re-analysed. When the new low-temperature results are combined with earlier ones
    the relationship found between density change Δ (t), and temperature t °C, for
    the range 0-20 °C, is Δ (t) = (-4.873 + 0.1708 t - 0.003108 t<sup>2</sup>) g/m<sup>3</sup>
    with an estimated uncertainty, 99%, of 0.2 g/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>"
