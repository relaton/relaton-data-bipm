abstract:
- content: '<p>That portion of applied statistics which is used for the treatment
    of experimental data is essentially founded on unbiased estimators - notwithstanding
    the fact that any real measurement process implies so-called unknown systematic
    errors. Until now, those perturbations giving rise to unknown deviations from
    the true values have been formally randomized, i.e. they are treated as if they
    were of random origin. Biased estimators thus again become fictitiously unbiased.
    However, the associated procedures suffer from two disadvantages: they are too
    complicated and, in the author''s opinion, they generate uncertainties which are
    not sufficiently reliable.</p><p>The submitted paper attempts to establish "Metrological
    Statistics" which, being based on biased estimators, is much simpler to handle
    and which, in particular, yields safe estimates for measurement uncertainties.</p>'
