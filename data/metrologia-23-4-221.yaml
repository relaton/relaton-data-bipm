  content: "<p>It is recommended that the term <italic>cycle</italic> (abbreviation
    cy) be introduced as a supplementary SI unit and that cycle and radian be used
    where appropriate to complete the SI units of quantities such as ν and ω, <italic>h</italic>
    and <italic>h</italic>, λ and λ̄. This would resolve a current and increasing
    confusion resulting from the misuse of such symbols as ω (as frequency) and λ̄
    (as wavelength) in solid state physics and spectroscopy. This proposal would also
    assist the visualization of the processes represented by certain equations.</p>"
