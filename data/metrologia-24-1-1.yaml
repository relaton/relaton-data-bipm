abstract:
- content: "<p>The Thompson-Lampard calculable cross-capacitor is used at the Physics
    and Engineering Laboratory (PEL) for the derivation of the ohm. A description
    of a calculable capacitor capable of determining the value of a 0.5 pF capacitor
    with an uncertainty of 2.2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> is given. A detailed model
    of the frequency dependence of calculable capacitors has been developed. This
    model is used to specifically derive the frequency correction for the PEL calculable
    capacitor. The model predicts a departure from a simple square-law frequency dependence
    of the correction and explains the observed frequency-dependent non-linearity
    of the capacitor. The model is also used to investigate the effect of changing
    the length and diameter of the capacitor and the significance of the use of ferromagnetic
    materials is also investigated.</p>"
