abstract:
- content: "<p>The reflection coefficient and complex discontinuity admittance of
    a coaxial open circuit with a hollow center conductor are derived from fields
    correct to first order in the skin depth. Results show an admittance terminating
    the line at the plane of the discontinuity and consisting of a resistance in parallel
    with a capacitive reactance. The first-order fields are also used to derive equations
    for the characteristic admittance, series impedance and shunt admittance of the
    line. These equations include terms neglected in the well-known expressions used
    to calculate the line parameters, enabling error limits to be assigned to the
    latter.</p>"
