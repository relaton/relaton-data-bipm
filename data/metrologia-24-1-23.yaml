abstract:
- content: "<p>A critical review of all beam-reversal phase-shift measurements carried
    out on NBS-6 (NBS-5) since 1973 is presented. The analysis takes into account
    a recent study of frequency shifts in atomic-beam frequency standards resulting
    from overlapping tails of adjacent lines. A strongly correlated variation of the
    cavity phase difference with time is shown, which appears to fit nicely on an
    exponential decay curve with a time constant of 3.7 years. The suggestion is made
    that some mechanical relaxation in the microwave structure may be responsible
    for this phenomenon. Furthermore, the line-pulling model seems to suggest a better
    explanation for observations previously attributed to distributed cavity phase
    shift. Verification of these interpretations through more involved evaluations
    may allow substantial reductions in the error budget for the standard.</p>"
