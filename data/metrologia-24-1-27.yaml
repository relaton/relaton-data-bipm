abstract:
- content: "<p>An international intercomparison of neutron fluence-rate at 144 and
    565 keV was organized under the auspices of the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures. Small indium foils were used as the transfer device, the induced radioactivity
    from the<sup>115</sup>In(n, γ)<sup>116m</sup>In reaction being assayed with a
    4πβ counter. The results of the intercomparison showed very good agreement between
    four standards laboratories at 144 keV, but there was a wider spread between six
    laboratories at 565 keV. The suitability of the indium-foil transfer device is
    also discussed, and it is concluded that in the future a more accurate system
    will be required.</p><p>As a result of this intercomparison, it has been found
    that neutron scatter in the target backing, when using the<sup>7</sup>Li (p,n)
    reaction as a source of neutrons in the energy range 100 to 600 keV, has apparently
    been underestimated in the past, which can have a large effect on activation capture
    cross-section measurements.</p>"
