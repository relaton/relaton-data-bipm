abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison has been made of the frequencies of He-Ne lasers
    stabilized using intracavity saturated absorption in<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    at 633 nm. Lasers at ten standards laboratories (PEL (New Zealand), NRC (Canada),
    NBS (USA), NPL (UK), PTB (FRG), NPL (India), NIM (China), NRLM (Japan), KSRI (South
    Korea), and NML (Australia)) were each compared in turn with a portable laser
    from PEL during March to May 1984.</p><p>The optical frequencies of all participating
    lasers exhibited a standard deviation of 23 kHz (5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) with
    a range of Â± 40 kHz. This standard deviation is a factor of seven smaller than
    the standard deviation of the absolute value recommended for the optical frequency
    of these lasers. If allowance is made for one iodine cell believed to be contaminated,
    the standard deviation is reduced to 18 kHz. Power-shift coefficients were measured,
    and ranged from + 1.4 kHz/mW to - 6 kHz/mW, referred to intracavity power.</p><p>It
    is concluded from the measured frequency offsets and power shifts that the best
    frequency reproducibility amongst different designs of laser is likely to be obtained
    at low levels of intracavity beam power (5 - 10 mW). The frequency reproducibility
    was not improved by extrapolating to zero power.</p>"
