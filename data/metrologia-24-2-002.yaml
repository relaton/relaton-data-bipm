abstract:
- content: "<p>Results of measurements of the<sup>3</sup>He virial coefficient<sup>3</sup>B
    (T) between 1.5 K and 20.3 K at the Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory (KOL) and of a
    theoretical calculation of<sup>3</sup>B (T) are reported. The uncertainty in the
    experimental data ranges from ± 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol at 1.5 K to ± 0.2 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol
    at 20.3 K. Experiment and calculation are shown to be in agreement to within 1
    cm<sup>3</sup>/mol at 1.5 K and 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol at 20.3 K. A comparison
    with the few existing data is made.</p>"
