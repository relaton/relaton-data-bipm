abstract:
- content: "<p>A method of constructing the standard for the newly defined luminous
    intensity unit, the candela, in the USSR is described. The standard is based on
    a non-selective radiometer/black-body (BB) combination. The temperature of the
    radiating cavity of the BB is obtained by measuring spectral and integral components
    of radiation at two different temperatures. The radiometer conversion coefficient
    is not measured by a substituting winding, but with the help of the BB according
    to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The relative spectral sensitivity of the radiometer
    is modified by the function V (λ) by means of a liquid filter. The unit of luminous
    intensity is then transferred by the photometer to the light-intensity-measuring
    lamps.</p><p>The standard has been metrologically certified and the (relative)
    uncertainty of reproduction was found to be 4 × 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p>"
