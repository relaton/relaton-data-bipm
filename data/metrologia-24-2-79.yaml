  content: <p>This paper describes the measurement methods and instrumentation used
    in the realization and transfer of the NBS scale of spectral radiance. The application
    of the basic measurement equation to both black-body and tungsten-strip-lamp sources
    is discussed. The polarization properties, response linearity, spectral responsivity
    function and "size-of-source effect" of the spectroradiometer are described. The
    analysis of sources of error and estimates of uncertainty are presented. The assigned
    uncertainities in spectral radiance range from about 2.1% at 225 nm to 0.3% at
    2400 nm.</p>
