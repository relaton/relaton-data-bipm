abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Calculation of the pressure dependence of the effective area of pressure balances normally assumes the pressure gradient in the clearance between the piston and cylinder to be constant along the engagement length of the piston which yields a linearly varying clearance between the piston and cylinder. The assumption is not strictly valid.</p><p>In this work, the assumption is avoided by applying the theory of flow in a converging channel to the pressure balance to calculate: (i) The upward force on the flanks of the piston due to fluid friction; (ii)
    The flow passing through the clearance and (iii) The pressure coefficient for a pressure balance.</p>
