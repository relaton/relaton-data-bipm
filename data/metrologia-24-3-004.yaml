abstract:
- content: "<p>Advances towards the realization of an absolute frequency standard
    in the submillimetre region are reported. The<sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub> ↔<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub>,
    Δm<sub>j</sub> = 0 fine-structure transition in the metastable triplet of<sup>24</sup>Mg
    has been observed in an atomic beam with a Ramsey-type interrogation technique.
    Its frequency, measured with an accuracy of ± 3 × 10<sup>-11</sup> with respect
    to a Cs standard, turned out to be ν<sub>0</sub> = (601 277 157 860 ± 20) Hz.</p>"
