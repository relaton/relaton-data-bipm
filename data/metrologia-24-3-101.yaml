abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper presents a discussion of the studies carried out at VNIIM
    on the measurement assurance of working and reference instruments in the field
    of measuring phase-shift angle (PSA) between two electric potentials. A description
    is given of the block diagram of the PSA standard and standard measures (phase
    calibrators) as well as the wide-band phase comparator designed to transfer the
    size of the PSA from the standard to lower echelons of the hierarchical chain.
    It is shown that the instrumental uncertainty lies between 0.0002° and 0.05° in
    the frequency range of 0.001 Hz to 10 MHz. A possibility of increasing the accuracy
    of phaseangle measurement up to 10<sup>-5</sup> - 10<sup>-6</sup> of a degree
    is indicated.</p>"
