  content: "<p>A study specifically intended to measure the triple-point temperature
    of both n-D<sub>2</sub> and e-D<sub>2</sub> containing a volume fraction of HD
    not higher than 0.0001 has been completed. It was performed by measuring samples
    of gas in metal sealed cells. The cells, after being checked for a non-increasing
    HD contamination within the stated limits, were filled by directly connecting
    them to the outlet of a thermal-diffusion column for isotopic separation, known
    to produce D<sub>2</sub> with a HD volume fraction not larger than 0.00003. In
    the case of e-D<sub>2</sub>, additional studies were performed on the effect of
    deuterating the catalyst or on high-temperature activation of the catalyst. Results
    proved that it is possible to obtain good results for e-D<sub>2</sub> with partially
    deuterated catalyst, but this does not allow a reliable control of the contamination.
    An alternative procedure to full deuteration has been found, which uses commercial
    hydrous ferric oxide heated to about 400 °C, and commercially available deuterium,
    produced by isotopic separation and showing a purity better than 99.99%. Temperature
    values (18.7327 ± 0.0003) K for n-D<sub>2</sub> and (18.6983 ± 0.0003) K for e-D<sub>2</sub>
    on NPL-IPTS-68 were obtained at the liquidus point; the best thermodynamic values
    for these triple points are (18.723<sub>2</sub> ± 0.001) K and (18.688<sub>8</sub>
    ± 0.001) K respectively; e-D<sub>2</sub> can be used as a first-quality temperature
    reference point.</p>"
