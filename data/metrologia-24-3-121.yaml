abstract:
- content: "<p>The speed of sound in mercury, c, for frequencies between 9.5 and 10.5
    MHz, has been measured by comparison with a frequency-stabilized infrared laser.
    For 75 mm diameter mercury columns with lengths L from 50 to 400 mm, temperatures
    T between 21.5 and 29.2 °C, and pressures P up to 230 kPa, the results are given
    in mm/s by c = 1449441 [1 - 3.032 × 10<sup>-4</sup> (T-23) + 1.42 × 10<sup>-10</sup>
    P - 1.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (L-400)] with a total uncertainty of 4.3 parts per million.
    These results have not been corrected for diffraction effects and the length L
    does not include that of a 10 mm beryllium buffer disk between the mercury and
    the ultrasonic transducer. The indicated length dependence is expected to decrease
    as the length increases beyond 400 mm.</p><p>The apparatus and techniques used
    for both the ultrasonic and optical measurements are discussed, along with details
    of the error analysis.</p>"
