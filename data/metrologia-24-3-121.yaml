    <p>The speed of sound in mercury, <italic>c</italic>, for frequencies between 9.5 and 10.5 MHz, has been measured by comparison with a frequency-stabilized infrared laser. For 75 mm diameter mercury columns with lengths <italic>L</italic> from 50 to 400 mm, temperatures <italic>T</italic> between 21.5 and 29.2 °C, and pressures <italic>P</italic> up to 230 kPa, the results are given in mm/s by <italic>c</italic> = 1449441 [1 - 3.032 × 10<sup>-4</sup> (<italic>T</italic>-23) + 1.42 × 10<sup>-10</sup> <italic>P</italic> - 1.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup> (<italic>L</italic>-400)] with a total uncertainty of 4.3 parts per million. These results have not been corrected for diffraction effects and the length <italic>L</italic> does not include that of a 10 mm beryllium buffer disk between the mercury and the ultrasonic transducer. The indicated length dependence is expected to decrease as the length increases beyond 400 mm.</p>
    <p>The apparatus and techniques used for both the ultrasonic and optical measurements are discussed, along with details of the error analysis.</p>
