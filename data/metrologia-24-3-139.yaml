  content: "<p>The paper describes the realization of a new scale of luminous intensity
    at the National Research Council of Canada, based on the 1979 redefinition of
    the candela. Two different methods were used. In the first method, the lamps were
    calibrated directly by means of absolute radiometers equipped with <italic>V</italic>(λ)-correcting
    filters. In the second method, secondary radiometers incorporating silicon photodiodes
    were first calibrated spectrally by means of absolute radiometers, then used in
    conjunction with <italic>V</italic>(λ) filters to calibrate the lamps. The sources
    of error and measurement results for the two methods are analyzed in detail. A
    comparison of the new scale with the previous platinum-blackbody-based scale indicates
    that the new NRC candela is 1.2% smaller on average than the old NRC candela.</p>"
