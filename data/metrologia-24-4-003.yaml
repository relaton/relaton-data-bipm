abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements of the Newtonian gravitational constant yielded the value
    G = 6.667 × 10<sup>-11</sup> Nm<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>-2</sup> with a 1σ uncertainty
    of ± 7 × 10<sup>-4</sup>. The report describes the set-up and function of the
    measuring equipment. The basic principle underlying the experiment is the classical
    principle of the torsion balance. New components are the mercury bearing of the
    balance beam and the control system with a quadrant electrometer according to
    Maxwell, which compensates the gravitational forces. The uncertainty of the measurement
    results and the intended improvements are discussed.</p>"
