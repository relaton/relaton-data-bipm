  content: "<p>Fifteen national laboratories participated in the comparison, using
    standard lamps of two different types for the comparison of luminous intensity
    and of a single type for that of luminous flux. The results, the first obtained
    since the adoption of the new definition of the candela, show only slight improvement
    in the agreement between the laboratories. But, since the number of participating
    laboratories has doubled since the last comparison and the new methods of realization
    used have differed more widely in technical detail, the mean representations of
    the candela and of the lumen are better established, which constitutes important
    progress.</p>"
