  content: "<p>Results of a theoretical study concerning the measuring principle of
    the interferometric fringe counting method are used to show ways and means to
    suppress the quantizing error by an integrating measurement of a stationary sinusoidal
    vibration. There are two counting methods presented which enable one, under different
    conditions of use, to reach a lower amplitude limit which with a comparable accuracy
    is by 3 powers of ten lower than that of the conventional interferometric fringe
    counting method. Results of experimental investigations including international
    comparison measurements have shown that with the outlined methods and equipment
    the range of frequencies in which absolute calibration of accelerometers can be
    performed while keeping the recommended acceleration range 1 to 100 m s<sup>-2</sup>
    has been extended to 20 kHz.</p>"
