abstract:
- content: "<p>The effect of replacing the boiling point of water with the triple
    point of gallium in several interpolation schemes for platinum resistance thermometers
    below 273.15 K is investigated. The sensitivity of the schemes to calibration
    errors in the gallium point is about five times higher than for calibration errors
    in the boiling point of water. This disadvantage is offset, however, by the greater
    accuracy of realization of the gallium point.</p>"
