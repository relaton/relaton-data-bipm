  content: "<p>The method of clock comparisons using GPS satellites in common view
    is now widely used in the time laboratories which participate in the international
    unification of time under the coordination of the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM). We report here the results of a campaign of calibration of
    time delay in GPS receivers under the auspices of the BIPM with the assistance
    of the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), Boulder, CO. This trip in the United
    States and in Europe was performed from September 29, 1986 to October 27, 1986.</p>"
