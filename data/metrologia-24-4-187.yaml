  content: "<p>This paper summarizes a report by the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM) of an international comparison of measurements of line scales
    which was instigated by the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition du Mètre (CCDM).
    Eleven national laboratories participated in the comparison. The reproducibility
    of reading a line using various microscopes is characterized by a standard deviation
    of approximately 0,02 μm in the best case, i.e. when focusing is good. It became
    evident that one of the causes of the dispersion of the results is the presence
    of soiling which may be more or less adhesive. For the measurement of an interval
    <italic>L</italic>, the standard deviation, <italic>s</italic>, of the result
    from any laboratory with respect to the mean of all laboratories is <italic>s</italic>
    = 0,03 μm + 0,08 × 10<sup>-6</sup> <italic>L</italic>. This standard deviation
    is approximately three times that which each laboratory gives to its results;
    it appears that certain components of the uncertainty have been underestimated
    and require further study.</p>"
