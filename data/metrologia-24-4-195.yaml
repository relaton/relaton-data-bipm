  content: "<p>The essential need of reliability of atomic time scales requires that
    these scales be based on the data of numerous clocks. But it is also expected
    that the algorithms used for processing these data optimize the stability by statistical
    prediction of the clock frequency. We have investigated the role of the frequency
    prediction and shown that, in the most common algorithms, frequency perturbations
    occur when the clock ensemble is modified, especially when clocks are entered
    or removed.</p>"
