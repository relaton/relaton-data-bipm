abstract:
- content: "<p>The frequency-shifting effect that neighbouring lines have on the clock
    transition of the PTB's frequency standards CS 2 and CSX is experimentally and
    theoretically investigated. The measurements confirm the model underlying the
    calculations, which allows for the consinusoidal field distribution in the end
    parts of the Ramsey cavity, the velocity distribution of the Cs atoms and the
    population of the hyperfine sublevels.</p><p>At the normal value of the static
    magnetic field usually called the C-field of CS 2, a reliable estimate of the
    frequency uncertainty contribution due to Rabi pulling is below 1 Ã— 10<sup>-16</sup>.</p>"
