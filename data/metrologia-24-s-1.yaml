abstract:
- content: "<p>The Newtonian Gravitational Constant, G, has probably been measured
    more often but, interestingly, with less precision than any other physical constant
    of fundamental importance. In an effort that has spanned more than a century to
    connect gravitation to the other forces of nature, over 200 experiments on G have
    been completed and reported; but many of them have not been reported in what would
    now be considered to be the open literature. This paper is a third, more complete
    attempt to carry MacKenzie's and Poynting's bibliographies forward from the 1800's
    to the present; and thereby include as many as possible of the experimental results
    on G that have been obtained since 1900.</p>"
