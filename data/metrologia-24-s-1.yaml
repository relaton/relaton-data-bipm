  content: "<p>The Newtonian Gravitational Constant,  <italic>G</italic>, has probably
    been measured more often but, interestingly, with less precision than any other
    physical constant of fundamental importance. In an effort that has spanned more
    than a century to connect gravitation to the other forces of nature, over 200
    experiments on  <italic>G</italic> have been completed and reported; but many
    of them have not been reported in what would now be considered to be the open
    literature. This paper is a third, more complete attempt to carry MacKenzie's
    and Poynting's bibliographies forward from the 1800's to the present; and thereby
    include as many as possible of the experimental results on  <italic>G</italic>
    that have been obtained since 1900.</p>"
