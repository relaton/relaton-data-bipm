  content: "<p>We analyse the results of beat-frequency measurements made on four
    (He - Ne)/CH<sub>4</sub> lasers. It is found that the lack of reproducibility
    of the frequency of such standards is linked to the existence of various parameters
    whose relative influences lead to unpredicted experimental results.</p>"
