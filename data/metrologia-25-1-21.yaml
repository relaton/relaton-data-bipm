abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison in the pressure range 20 - 100 MPa has
    been carried out under the auspices of the high-pressure working group of the
    Comité Consultatif pour la Masse et les grandeurs apparentées (CCM) of the Comité
    International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM). The Standards Laboratories of 13 countries
    have participated in this comparison, which took place during the period 1981
    - 1985. This paper presents a résumé of the comparison.</p><p>The transfer standard
    used was an oil-operated pressure balance. Each laboratory determined the effective
    area of the piston-cylinder assembly of this balance in the pressure range 20
    - 100 MPa. The results of the measurement of the effective area extrapolated to
    zero applied pressure agreed within 204 parts per million (ppm) for all 13 laboratories
    (9 laboratories agreed within 53 ppm). The results of the measurement of the effective
    area at 100 MPa agreed within 414 ppm for all 13 laboratories (8 laboratories
    agreed within 78 ppm).</p>"
