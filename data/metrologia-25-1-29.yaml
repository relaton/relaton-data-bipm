  content: "<p>A radiometric realization of the S.I. base unit of photometry, the
    candela, as performed at the National Physical Laboratory, is described and the
    results compared with the scale established at NPL in 1937 and disseminated since
    1948. The realization has been carried out in accordance with the radiometrically
    based redefinition given by the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM)
    in 1979 which quantifies the spectral luminous efficacy of radiation at a specified
    frequency (540 × 10<sup>12</sup> Hz) as 683 lumens per watt. The excellent performance
    of the siliconphotodiode photometers developed for this project is demonstrated,
    together with characteristics of the two types of lamp employed for preserving
    the results of the realization and methods for improving their alignment and reproducibility.</p>"
