abstract:
- content: "<p>The thermodynamic temperatures of the silver, gold and copper-silver
    eutectic fixed points were measured with a photoelectric pyrometer relative to
    an aluminium point of 660.302 °C. The values obtained were (961.744 ± 0.055) °C,
    (1064.145 ± 0.060) °C and (779.583 ± 0.060) °C respectively. Although the final
    uncertainty of the copper-silver eutectic was similar to that of the other two,
    the effort necessary to obtain it was much greater and it is not recommended as
    a major reference point for use in photoelectric pyrometry.</p>"
