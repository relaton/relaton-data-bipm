abstract:
- content: "<p>A correlation function for second virial coefficients of<sup>4</sup>He
    calculated on the basis of an accurate interatomic potential is presented. Such
    a correlation is more physically based than one fitted directly to the raw data.
    The intermediate step of fitting a realistic potential form to the virials as
    well as other precise data serves the function of smoothing the raw data, thus
    avoiding systematic error trends. A flexible correlation function is then fitted
    to the calculated virials.</p>"
