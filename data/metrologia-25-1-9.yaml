  content: "<p>Comparison of the VNIIFTRI and LPTF frequency multiplication chains
    has been carried out through the measurement of the frequency of a portable VNIIFTRI
    (He-Ne)/CH<sub>4</sub> laser. Agreement is within 100 Hz (1.1 parts in 10<sup>12</sup>)
    and is secured by the very good medium-term frequency repeatability of the (He-Ne)/CH<sub>4</sub>
    VNIIFTRI portable laser (a few parts in 10<sup>13</sup>). On the same occasion
    a measurement of the frequency of the BIPM (He-Ne)/CH<sub>4</sub> reference laser
    (B.3) has been performed at LPTF. Other experiments carried out on the BIPM laser
    show that the reproducibility of the (He-Ne)/CH<sub>4</sub> system could be improved
    by a systematic study and then by a better control of the various perturbing factors
    which influence the shape of the methane-saturated absorption peak.</p>"
