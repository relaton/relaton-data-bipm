abstract:
- content: "<p>The difference (T - T<sub>68</sub>) between international practical
    temperature and thermodynamic temperature has been measured in the range from
    693 K to 904 K using a pyrometric method.</p><p>Taking T - T<sub>68</sub> = 0.067
    K at 693 K as a reference, the difference is expressed by: T - T<sub>68</sub>
    = -0.2749 × 10<sup>-3</sup> T + 0.1235 K, giving (- 125 ± 8) mK at 904 K; the
    uncertainty corresponds to one standard deviation.</p>"
