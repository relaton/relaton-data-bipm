  content: "<p>Brief descriptions are given of the design and operating principles
    of the NPL total radiation thermometer. Further measurements of <italic>T-T</italic><sub>68</sub>
    are reported for the temperature range - 130 to +60°C and tabulated with previous
    measurements made in the range -40 to +100°C. A graph is presented of all the
    published measurements of <italic>T-T</italic><sub>68</sub> from various independent
    primary thermometers in the range 50 to 400 K, and their relevance to the construction
    of a reference function for the proposed ITS-90 is discussed.</p>"
