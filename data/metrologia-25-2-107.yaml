abstract:
- content: "<p>Brief descriptions are given of the design and operating principles
    of the NPL total radiation thermometer. Further measurements of T-T<sub>68</sub>
    are reported for the temperature range - 130 to +60°C and tabulated with previous
    measurements made in the range -40 to +100°C. A graph is presented of all the
    published measurements of T-T<sub>68</sub> from various independent primary thermometers
    in the range 50 to 400 K, and their relevance to the construction of a reference
    function for the proposed ITS-90 is discussed.</p>"
