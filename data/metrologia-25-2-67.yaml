  content: "<p>Starting from a simplified model calculation, typical of the way in
    which magnetoquantum effects were discussed before they became of interest for
    precision metrology, a survey is made of the problems encountered in developing
    a quantitative theory of the quantum Hall effect in real systems. Several possible
    lines of thought are described, together with some results and some hitherto unanswered
    questions. Finally, it is shown how suitable experiments contribute to a better
    insight into the nature of the quantum Hall effect.</p>"
