    <p>The experimental techniques used by the national institutes of metrology to measure the quantized Hall resistance in terms of their representations of the ohm are described. The agreement among these measurements is examined using the results of the comparisons of national standards of electrical resistance (1 Ω) made at the BIPM.</p>
    <p>The results of measurements of the quantized Hall resistance in SI units using calculable standards of capacitance are also examined and compared with indirect evaluations based on the determination of different fundamental constants.</p>
