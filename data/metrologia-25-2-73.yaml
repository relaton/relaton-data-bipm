abstract:
- content: "<p>The experimental techniques used by the national institutes of metrology
    to measure the quantized Hall resistance in terms of their representations of
    the ohm are described. The agreement among these measurements is examined using
    the results of the comparisons of national standards of electrical resistance
    (1 Ω) made at the BIPM.</p><p>The results of measurements of the quantized Hall
    resistance in SI units using calculable standards of capacitance are also examined
    and compared with indirect evaluations based on the determination of different
    fundamental constants.</p>"
