abstract:
- content: <p>In mathematics the uncertainties of numerical results can be represented
    by intervals, by dispersion characterisitcs, or by fuzzy numbers. By considering
    the measurement result not as a point but as a set, interval calculus may be introduced
    into the evaluation of measurements. With interval representation an analogy to
    the correlation of statistical data is to be considered. The use of statistical
    methods for the evaluation of measurements is justified if the state of statistical
    control is checked, usually by means of control charts. A pulse-density distribution
    within the interval is used for the combination of interval and statistical methods.
    Intervals can be transformed to fuzzy numbers which allow the "uncertainty of
    uncertainty" to be considered.</p>
