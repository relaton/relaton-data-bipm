  content: "<p>Air-buoyancy corrections are often a dominant source of error in the
    transfer of the unit of mass through weighing of nominally equal weights of different
    densities. The possibilities of monitoring air density through measurement of
    the refractive index of air are considered. A critical discussion is given of
    the present knowledge of the refractivities of air and its constituent gases.
    A simple laser refractometer capable of resolving air-density variations of 0.15
    × 10<sup>-3</sup> kg m<sup>-3</sup>, corresponding to a change in air buoyancy
    of 9 μg, is demonstrated in weighings of the Swedish prototype kilogram with stainless-steel
    standards.</p>"
