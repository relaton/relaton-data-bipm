  content: "<p>The accuracy of a 10.6 μm CO<sub>2</sub> laser interferometer for distance
    measurements is determined experimentally. The frequency of a commercial wavelength-stabilized
    CO<sub>2</sub> laser is determined by comparison with a reference CO<sub>2</sub>
    laser. A refractometer is used to measure the refractive index of moist air in
    the 10 μm wavelength region, within an uncertainty of 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>. The
    performance of the CO<sub>2</sub> system for length measurement is then verified
    by comparison with a wavelength-calibrated 0.63 μm He-Ne system, over distances
    up to 5 m. The result shows that the CO<sub>2</sub> laser interferometer can measure
    distances with an accuracy of better than 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> in atmospheric air.</p>"
