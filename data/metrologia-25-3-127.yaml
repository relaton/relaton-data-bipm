abstract:
- content: "<p>The determination of the value of 2e/h by means of voltage balances
    in the institutions: LCIE, PTB, CSIRO and ETF in Zagreb, is discussed. The construction
    of the balances is described. The measurement results achieved, as well as their
    expected and obtained partial and total measuring uncertainties, are reviewed.</p>"
