abstract:
- content: "<p>A description of the development and practical use of large Josephson
    series arrays for precision voltage measurements is given. The design and the
    measurement uncertainty of a standard instrument is described. The frequency stability
    is directly controlled by a radio signal of the long-wave transmitter DCF 77.
    The voltage standard does not need a screened room, and therefore it is ready
    for use independent of time and locality. It is shown that in 6 minutes a calibration
    of a Weston cell can be carried out with a total relative uncertainty (1 σ) of
    12 × 10<sup>-10</sup> at 0.1 Hz bandwidth. By decreasing the bandwidth a value
    of 6.5 × 10<sup>-10</sup> is the ultimate limit for a single calibration.</p>"
