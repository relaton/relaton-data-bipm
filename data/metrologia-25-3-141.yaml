  content: "<p>The vapor pressure of carbon dioxide in equilibrium with the liquid
    at 0.01 °C has been measured; the value is found to be 3.48608 ± 0.00017 MPa.
    Results were found to depend on the purity of the carbon dioxide. The relatively
    simple procedures reported herein produced carbon dioxide samples of sufficient
    purity to be suitable for use of this vapor-pressure value as a pressure fixed
    point.</p>"
