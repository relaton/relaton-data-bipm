abstract:
- content: "<p>The definition of the electronvolt, 1 eV, as the energy a particle
    with charge e gains by traversing a potential difference of 1 V, can be used for
    absolute determination of high voltages by fast-beam laser velocimetry. The velocity
    of heavy ions, which are accelerated in an unknown high-voltage potential, is
    measured using a frequency-stabilized cw dye laser. The measured Doppler shift
    directly yields the velocity of the ions, thus determining their energy. The energy
    is, in turn, related to the accelerating voltage U by the atomic masses and the
    atomic mass constant m<sub>u</sub>c<sup>2</sup>/{e}, where 1/{e} represents the
    conversion from joule to electronvolt. The fundamental masses are typically known
    to within a few parts in 10<sup>7</sup> as is the atomic mass constant. This imposes
    a fundamental limit on the proposed high-voltage standard of δU/U ≈ 3 × 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p>"
