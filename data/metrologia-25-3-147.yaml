  content: "<p>The definition of the electronvolt, 1 eV, as the energy a particle
    with charge <italic>e</italic> gains by traversing a potential difference of 1
    V, can be used for absolute determination of high voltages by fast-beam laser
    velocimetry. The velocity of heavy ions, which are accelerated in an unknown high-voltage
    potential, is measured using a frequency-stabilized cw dye laser. The measured
    Doppler shift directly yields the velocity of the ions, thus determining their
    energy. The energy is, in turn, related to the accelerating voltage <italic>U</italic>
    by the atomic masses and the atomic mass constant <italic>m</italic><sub>u</sub><italic>c</italic><sup>2</sup>/{e},
    where 1/{e} represents the conversion from joule to electronvolt. The fundamental
    masses are typically known to within a few parts in 10<sup>7</sup> as is the atomic
    mass constant. This imposes a fundamental limit on the proposed high-voltage standard
    of δ<italic>U/U</italic> ≈ 3 × 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p>"
