    <p>The liquidus-point behaviour of high-purity and impure D<sub>2</sub> has been studied in both normal and equilibrium states. It was found that the liquidus point in the limit of vanishing amount of condensed phase is nearly impurity independent; D<sub>2</sub> samples doped with as much as 1% H<sub>2</sub> had liquidus points only about 2 mK different from the purest samples available.</p>
    <p>The temperatures (on the IPTS-68) for the triple points of equilibrium and normal D<sub>2</sub> were found to be 18.696<sub>3</sub> K and 18.731<sub>9</sub> K respectively; the normal boiling point of equilibrium D<sub>2</sub> was found to be 23.636<sub>9</sub> K; the heat of fusion was measured as 49.53 J/g; and the density of D<sub>2</sub> gas at the triple-point temperature and pressure for normal D<sub>2</sub> is 4.61 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p>The vapour pressure of equilibrium D<sub>2</sub> between its normal boiling and triple points can be well described by a polynomial of the form ln (<italic>P</italic>/<italic>P</italic><sub>0</sub>) = ∑<sub><italic>i</italic>=−1</sub><sup>4</sup> <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>T</italic> − <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>)<sup><italic>i</italic></sup> </p>
