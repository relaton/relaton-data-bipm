abstract:
- content: "<p>The liquidus-point behaviour of high-purity and impure D<sub>2</sub>
    has been studied in both normal and equilibrium states. It was found that the
    liquidus point in the limit of vanishing amount of condensed phase is nearly impurity
    independent; D<sub>2</sub> samples doped with as much as 1% H<sub>2</sub> had
    liquidus points only about 2 mK different from the purest samples available.</p><p>The
    temperatures (on the IPTS-68) for the triple points of equilibrium and normal
    D<sub>2</sub> were found to be 18.696<sub>3</sub> K and 18.731<sub>9</sub> K respectively;
    the normal boiling point of equilibrium D<sub>2</sub> was found to be 23.636<sub>9</sub>
    K; the heat of fusion was measured as 49.53 J/g; and the density of D<sub>2</sub>
    gas at the triple-point temperature and pressure for normal D<sub>2</sub> is 4.61
    g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The vapour pressure of equilibrium D<sub>2</sub> between
    its normal boiling and triple points can be well described by a polynomial of
    the form ln (P/P<sub>0</sub>) = ∑<sub>i=−1</sub><sup>4</sup> a<sub>i</sub>(T −
    T<sub>0</sub>)<sup>i</sup></p>"
