abstract:
- content: "<p>The speed of sound in argon has been accurately measured in the pressure
    range 25-380 kPa at the temperature of the triple point of gallium (T<sub>g</sub>)
    and at 340 kPa at the temperature of the triple point of water (T<sub>t</sub>).
    The results are combined with previously published thermodynamic and transport
    property data to obtain T<sub>g</sub> = (302.9169 ± 0.0005) K on the thermodynamic
    scale. Among recent determinations of T<sub>68</sub> (the temperature on IPTS-68)
    at the gallium triple point, those with the smallest measurement uncertainty fall
    in the range 302.923 71 to 302.923 98 K. We conclude that T-T<sub>68</sub> = (-6.9
    ± 0.5) mK near 303 K, in agreement with results obtained from other primary thermometers.
    The speed of sound was measured with a spherical resonator. The volume and thermal
    expansion of the resonator were determined by weighing the mercury required to
    fill it at T<sub>t</sub> and T<sub>g</sub>. The largest part of the standard error
    in the present determination of T<sub>g</sub> is systematic. It results from imperfect
    knowledge of the thermal expansion of mercury between T<sub>t</sub> and T<sub>g</sub>.
    Smaller parts of the error result from imperfections in the measurement of the
    temperature of the resonator and of the resonance frequencies.</p>"
