  content: "<p>The speed of sound in argon has been accurately measured in the pressure
    range 25-380 kPa at the temperature of the triple point of gallium (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>)
    and at 340 kPa at the temperature of the triple point of water (<italic>T</italic><sub>t</sub>).
    The results are combined with previously published thermodynamic and transport
    property data to obtain <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> = (302.9169 ± 0.0005) K
    on the thermodynamic scale. Among recent determinations of <italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub>
    (the temperature on IPTS-68) at the gallium triple point, those with the smallest
    measurement uncertainty fall in the range 302.923 71 to 302.923 98 K. We conclude
    that <italic>T-T</italic><sub>68</sub> = (-6.9 ± 0.5) mK near 303 K, in agreement
    with results obtained from other primary thermometers. The speed of sound was
    measured with a spherical resonator. The volume and thermal expansion of the resonator
    were determined by weighing the mercury required to fill it at <italic>T</italic><sub>t</sub>
    and <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. The largest part of the standard error in
    the present determination of <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> is systematic. It
    results from imperfect knowledge of the thermal expansion of mercury between <italic>T</italic><sub>t</sub>
    and <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>. Smaller parts of the error result from imperfections
    in the measurement of the temperature of the resonator and of the resonance frequencies.</p>"
