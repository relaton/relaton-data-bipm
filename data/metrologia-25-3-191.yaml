  content: "<p>The freezing point of palladium in argon was measured with a photoelectric
    pyrometer to be 1555.1 ± 0.15°C (standard deviation) using the freezing point
    of gold (temperature = 1064.43°C) as reference. This value is in satisfactory
    agreement with all recent determinations.</p>"
