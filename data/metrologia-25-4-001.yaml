abstract:
- content: "<p>In distinguishing between `category of quantities' and `dimension'
    the author intends to reach a new understanding of the quantity plane angle. One
    basis is tensor algebra. Accordingly, the common angle φ (or θ) can be separated
    into the quantity `arc-radius ratio x' on the one hand and the quantity `angle
    γ' on the other, each belonging to different categories of quantities.</p><p>Another
    basis is the mathematical concept of `embedding'. It allows the mapping of specific
    `categories of quantities' into a selected `dimension'. Therefore, the category
    of angles can be embedded either into the `dimension(-less) ratio' or into a specific
    `dimension angle'.</p><p>The examples in this paper show that there is no need
    for a change in teaching mathematics if the angle is explicitly used in defining
    rotary-motion quantities.</p><p>The author emphasizes transparency and perspicuity.
    He argues for an explicit use of the angle γ in rotational mechanics. Furthermore,
    he suggests that there should be an internationally applicable unit name (e.g.
    Ri, Re or Ro) for the reference magnitude `full angle Γ'.</p>"
