abstract:
- content: "<p>An apparatus to utilize the H<sub>2</sub>O (I) - H<sub>2</sub>O (III)
    - H<sub>2</sub>O (L) triple point as a pressure fixed point is described. A technique
    to establish the three phases simultaneously in the cell is described. The value
    of the pressure was measured with a piston gage and was found to be (208.829 Â±
    0.025) MPa at the 99.7 percent confidence level.</p>"
