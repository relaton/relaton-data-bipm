    <p>In distinguishing between `category of quantities' and `dimension' the author intends to reach a new understanding of the quantity plane angle. One basis is tensor algebra. Accordingly, the common angle φ (or θ) can be separated into the quantity `arc-radius ratio <italic>x</italic>' on the one hand and the quantity `angle γ' on the other, each belonging to different categories of quantities.</p>
    <p>Another basis is the mathematical concept of `embedding'. It allows the mapping of specific `categories of quantities' into a selected `dimension'. Therefore, the category of angles can be embedded either into the `dimension(-less) ratio' or into a specific `dimension angle'.</p>
    <p>The examples in this paper show that there is no need for a change in teaching mathematics if the angle is explicitly used in defining rotary-motion quantities.</p>
    <p>The author emphasizes transparency and perspicuity. He argues for an explicit use of the angle γ in rotational mechanics. Furthermore, he suggests that there should be an internationally applicable unit name (e.g. Ri, Re or Ro) for the reference magnitude `full angle Γ'.</p>
