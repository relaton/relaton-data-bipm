  content: "<p>Microwave resonances have been used to measure the volumetric thermal
    expansion of a spherical cavity between the temperature of the triple point of
    water (<italic>T</italic><sub>t</sub>) and the temperature of the triple point
    of gallium (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>). Using the TM 1,1 and TM 1,2 modes,
    we find 10<sup>6</sup> [<italic>V</italic>(<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>)/<italic>V</italic>(<italic>T</italic><sub>t</sub>)
    - 1] = 1418.5 ± 1.0 and 1418.1 ± 0.6, respectively. These results are in agreement
    with the value 1416.6 ± 1.5 obtained by filling the cavity with mercury and using
    it as a dilatometer. The microwave measurements are sufficiently accurate that
    they can be used for primary gas or acoustic thermometry and for measuring the
    changes in volume standards with temperature, pressure, or time. We have evidence
    that microwave measurements can be used to determine the volume of a spherical
    cavity with an uncertainty of the order of 30 ppm and further improvements are
    likely.</p>"
