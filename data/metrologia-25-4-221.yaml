  content: "<p>Liquidus points of Research Grade xenon samples from four different
    suppliers were intercompared and found to spread over a range of 0.45 mK. Such
    samples, with suitable experimental procedures, are acceptable for establishing
    a defining fixed point of the forthcoming new international temperature scale.</p>"
