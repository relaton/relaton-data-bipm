  content: "<p>The use of the triple points of deuterium and xenon is investigated
    in some interpolation schemes for platinum resistance thermometers between 13.8
    K and 273 K. The use of these triple points together is shown to lead to a large
    sensitivity to errors in the realization of the boiling point of water or the
    triple point of gallium and of the triple point of xenon for interpolated temperatures
    below 25 K. The behaviour of these interpolation schemes is presented as evidence
    that the large non-uniqueness observed in temperature scales between 84 K and
    273 K is due in part to measurement errors at the boiling point of water. The
    use of the triple point of xenon in an interpolation scheme between 25 K and 273
    K is shown to lead to a large sensitivity to calibration errors in the triple
    points of xenon and gallium between 25 K and 54 K.</p>"
