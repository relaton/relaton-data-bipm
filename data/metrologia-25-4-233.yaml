  content: "<p>Quantum electrodynamics enables us to extract a precise value of the
    fine-structure constant α from measurements of the hyperfine structure of the
    muonium ground state and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Results
    obtained thus far are reviewed and compared with the values of α obtained from
    the ac Josephson effect and the quantized Hall effect.</p>"
