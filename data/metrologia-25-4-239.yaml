  content: "<p>The National Radium (<sup>226</sup>Ra) Standards of the UK and the
    USSR have recently been compared by means of a transfer standard provided by the
    National Physical Laboratory. Good agreement was obtained between the three methods
    used, and the results were also in agreement with that of a comparison with the
    National Radium Standard of the USA.</p>"
