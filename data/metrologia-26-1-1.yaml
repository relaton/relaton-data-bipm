    <p>The absorptions of OsO<sub>4</sub> in coincidence with CO<sub>2</sub> laser emissions have very attractive metrological characteristics, as has been demonstrated by several high-resolution frequency measurements. We evaluate in this work the possibilities of realizing a frequency standard at 30 THz based on an OsO<sub>4</sub> molecular beam with a Ramsey-type interaction technique which could allow an accuracy level of 10<sup>-14</sup> or better with a high short-term stability.</p>
    <p>The possible interaction and detection techniques are discussed in order to evaluate the observed line-width and the signal-to-noise ratio, taking into account the molecular flux achievable with a multichannel source. The main uncertainty sources are also discussed.</p>
