abstract:
- content: "<p>The absorptions of OsO<sub>4</sub> in coincidence with CO<sub>2</sub>
    laser emissions have very attractive metrological characteristics, as has been
    demonstrated by several high-resolution frequency measurements. We evaluate in
    this work the possibilities of realizing a frequency standard at 30 THz based
    on an OsO<sub>4</sub> molecular beam with a Ramsey-type interaction technique
    which could allow an accuracy level of 10<sup>-14</sup> or better with a high
    short-term stability.</p><p>The possible interaction and detection techniques
    are discussed in order to evaluate the observed line-width and the signal-to-noise
    ratio, taking into account the molecular flux achievable with a multichannel source.
    The main uncertainty sources are also discussed.</p>"
