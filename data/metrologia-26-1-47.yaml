abstract:
- content: "<p>We give here the background and basis for the new international electrical
    reference standards of voltage and resistance that are to come into effect worldwide
    starting on 1st January 1990. Founded on the Josephson and quantum Hall effects,
    respectively, these new reference standards will improve significantly the international
    uniformity of electrical measurements and their consistency with the SI.</p>"
