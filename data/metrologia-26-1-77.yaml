    <p>This 120-page book is a concise, yet comprehensive, clearly-written and well-illustrated monograph that covers the subject matter from basic principles through design, construction and calibration details to the principal applications. The book will be useful, as a primer, to the uninitiated and, as a reference book to the practitioner involved with transformer-type ratio devices. The length of the book and the style of presentation will not overburden any informed reader. The described techniques and the cited references are primarily from the work at the National Research Council, Canada (NRC). Any omissions, however, are not serious with respect to coverage of the subject matter, since most of the development work has been done at NRC.</p>
    <p>The role of transformers and transformer-like devices for establishing accurate voltage and current ratios has been recognized for over half a century. Transformer techniques were much explored and developed in the fifties and sixties for accuracy levels suitable for standards laboratories. Three-winding voltage transformers were developed for scaling of impedances in connection with the calculable Thompson–Lampard capacitor; three-winding current transformers or current comparators were initially explored for the calibration of current transformers and later for specialized impedance measurements. Extensive development of the current comparator and its applications has been and is still being conducted at the NRC by a team that was started and, until his retirement, led by N L Kusters. The team is now led by W J M Moore. He and P N Miljanic, the authors of this book, have had the principal roles in the development of the current comparator. It is fortunate for the field of metrology that considerabe resources and a talented group of researchers were available to do this development along with mechanisms that were available to transfer this technology to a private sector instrument manufacturer and, thus, disseminate it world wide. One would hardly find a standards laboratory today without an instrument employing a current comparator. The NRC program, now nearing the end of its third decade, has resulted in a large number of papers in technical journals. The fact that the results of the current-comparator program are now documented in a well-written book is a most welcome development.</p>
    <p>The material in the book is well organized and divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 deals very briefly with the historical aspects of the development, including related work in other organizations. Chapter 2 is the longest, occupying one third of the book. It presents the background theory; the definitions and origins of the errors; and the related concepts and devices including two-stage current transformers, electronic methods for improving the performance of current transformers, and null detectors.</p>
    <p>The idea of the current comparator is developed starting from Ampere's law; and then progressing to the practical realization of measuring the line integral of the magnetic field surrounding an electric current. Such an approach, as opposed to the more common methods of analyzing transformers, has a tutorial value in explaining how the current balance is achieved. Such analysis is intuitive for air-core sensing coils with infinitesimal cross-sections and uniform winding densities. The intuitive understanding, however, becomes less obvious when high-permeability magnetic cores are used.</p>
    <p>The subject of errors is discussed thoroughly. For errors of magnetic origin, ample experimental data are provided to support the hypothesis for the cause of such errors. The cause is discussed in a macroscopic sense (non-uniform effective permeability along the torus) without going into design and processing details which could be responsible for the non-uniformities. For capacitive errors, equations have been developed to compute them from geometrical considerations. Techniques are presented to reduce both types of errors shielding techniques for magnetic errors and magnetic-shield excitation for capacitive errors. The magnetic-shield-excitation technique leads naturally to two-stage transformer approaches, described in a small subchapter.</p>
    <p>Sensitivity of current comparators is discussed in terms of available signal levels for given excitations and current-comparator characteristics. The discussion, however, does not cover more basic limitations, such as inherent noise. A subchapter is devoted to electronically-aided current transformers. Although electronically-aided transformers are not in a strict sense current comparators, many of the design considerations and error sources are the same. Seven different circuits are presented with a brief qualitative discussion.</p>
    <p>The third chapter, covering design and construction, will be exceptionally valuable for someone needing basic information on how to construct a current comparator quickly. Indeed, all the necessary design, construction, and testing steps are presented in a well-illustrated 15-page chapter. The tests for shielding effectiveness discussed in this chapter and the knowledge of interwinding capacitances calculable from the equations in the previous chapter should enable one also to predict the limits of errors without an exhaustive and complete calibration.</p>
    <p>Chapter 4 is devoted to current-transformer calibration—the original objective for the current-comparator development work. The principal tool for this is the compensated current comparator, in effect a two-stage transformer operated in the current-comparator mode. The compensated current comparator is not only accurate but is also an extremely versatile device and, hence, deserves the attention that it receives in this book. Considerable space is devoted to the calibration of current comparators themselves using other current comparators in ratio-buildup (bootstrap) techniques. This information is more than most of the users will want since the pre-eminent feature of a current comparator is that errors can be made inherently negligible with proper construction techniques. Proper functioning can be verified by spot checks on a few ratios, and by indirect means. Complete calibration is useful, however, to verify the original design.</p>
    <p>A number of circuits incorporating compensated current comparators for current-transformer calibration are presented. Such circuits cover the calibration of current transformers normally encountered in electric-power transmission and distribution, from several amperes to several thousand amperes; cascaded circuits for very large currents up to 60,000 A; and special cases involving less-than-unity ratio (step-up) current transformers. Peripheral equipment such as ratio-sets and burdens are also discussed. This entire chapter is of great practical interest since much of the world's current-transformer calibration is performed using equipment described therein.</p>
    <p>The next two chapters, 5 and 6, deal with current-comparator applications in impedance-bridge circuits. High-voltage applications (described in Chapter 5) have been of great practical importance and indeed are the techniques of choice for a number of measurements. High-voltage bridge circuits are described for capacitance, inductance, voltage transformer ratio, and low-power-factor power measurements.</p>
    <p>Without going into much detail, the book mentions the particular characteristics required of current
    comparators in high-voltage bridge applications. Other components making up the bridge circuits are also described, as well as the calibration technique for the bridge. Limited in application but important in basic metrology is one particular low-voltage bridge, described in Chapter 6, for realization of ac power in terms of more basic SI units. Applications to ac resistance measurements and to realization of transconductance amplifiers are also included.</p>
    <p>Chapter 7, consisting of only eight pages, is devoted to direct-current comparators, although specific topics applicable to dc use are covered in earlier chapters. In relation to the number of dc vs ac instruments in use, the length of this chapter presents something of an imbalance. Nevertheless, in the limited number of pages, the authors have covered the principal direct-current comparator applications—the ratio device (dc comparator), the resistance bridge, and the potentiometer. More specialized instruments such as the differential voltmeter and the digital-to-analog converter are also mentioned. The unique feature of the dc comparator is the modulator-type balance detector. It is covered in Chapter 3 with current-comparator construction details.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the technical depth and style of discussion, the material covered, the size of the volume, and the ample references suggest that the authors should satisfy most of the audience interested in current comparators. A possible exception might be those interested in extremely high accuracies (errors in the
    10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-9</sup> range). The authors have selected the overall approach of presentation that is predominantly pragmatic rather than analytical. Metrologists unfamiliar with current comparators should be able, after a day's reading, to embark upon the construction of their own devices or upon the application of current comparators to their own measurement needs. The serious practioner will find the book valuable for the complete coverage of the subject and the bibliography. Also, most practitioners should find in the book a number of useful design, construction, or application tricks for their own use.</p>
    <p>At the present time, development activity on transformer-type ratio devices, including the current comparator, has subsided in comparison with the peak level of the sixties. For many applications, however, these devices remain the most accurate and sometimes the only viable instruments for scaling current and voltage. The applications include factory test systems and instruments for absolute electrical measurements. This situation is likely to continue for at least one more generation of metrologists. Thus, not only present but also future generations of metrologists will benefit from the book by not having to spend countless hours in "reinventing the wheel" or in searching scattered journal literature. One only wishes that other specialized fields of metrology could benefit from similar endeavors.</p>
