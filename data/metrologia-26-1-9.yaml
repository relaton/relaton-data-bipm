abstract:
- content: "<p>The volt has been determined to high accuracy using a liquid electrometer.
    The representation of the volt maintained by the Josephson effect using the value
    of 2 e/h = 483.594 THz/V recommended by the Consultative Committee on Electricity
    of the International Committee of Weights and Measures in 1972 has been measured
    to be smaller than the SI volt by (8.09 ± 0.27) ppm. This implies that the SI
    value of 2 e/h is (483.59791 ± 0.00013) THz/V. Full experimental details are given.</p>"
