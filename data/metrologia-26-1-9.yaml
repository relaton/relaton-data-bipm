  content: "<p>The volt has been determined to high accuracy using a liquid electrometer.
    The representation of the volt maintained by the Josephson effect using the value
    of 2 <italic>e/h</italic> = 483.594 THz/V recommended by the Consultative Committee
    on Electricity of the International Committee of Weights and Measures in 1972
    has been measured to be smaller than the SI volt by (8.09 ± 0.27) ppm. This implies
    that the SI value of 2 <italic>e/h</italic> is (483.59791 ± 0.00013) THz/V. Full
    experimental details are given.</p>"
