abstract:
- content: "<p>The usual error model for calibration experiments is extended to situations
    where there are both short-term and long-term random errors of measurement. Such
    error models are useful where short-term errors are related to instrumentation,
    and long-term errors are related to operating procedures, environmental factors
    or changes in the artifacts themselves. The concept of a check standard is advanced
    for estimating variability and maintaining statistical control of the measurement
    process.</p>"
