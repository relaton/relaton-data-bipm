  content: "<p>A general technique for estimating the effect of modelling errors on
    linear least-squares problems is discussed and applied to the specific example
    of determining the systematic effect of the vertical gravity gradient on free-fall
    absolute gravity measurements. The effective measurement height of an absolute
    gravimeter occurs nominally at the height corresponding to one third of the drop.
    However, this rule of thumb can be in error by several centimeters due to the
    initial velocity. The true measurement height is also sensitive to the number
    of points used and the distribution of the points selected for the least-squares
    solution.</p>"
