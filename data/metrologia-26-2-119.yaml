  content: "<p>Two active hydrogen masers constructed at the CSIRO Division of Applied
    Physics have been contributing to the laboratory's frequency and time scales since
    1982. Design and performance details are discussed. Vacuum-pump lifetimes necessitate
    servicing of the masers every few years and these operations can cause frequency
    drifts of 2 × 10<sup>-15</sup> per day due to contamination of the maser bulb
    surface. However, recovery, to 2 × 10<sup>-14</sup> per year occurs over a year
    or two. By staggering service operations, continuous frequency and time scales
    are achieved which compare favourably with such scales in other countries.</p>"
