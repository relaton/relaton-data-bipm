abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is described for measuring oscillatory displacements in the
    range 2 nm to 255 nm, using a laser interferometer. The reference mirror is moved
    at a constant velocity, modulating the photoelectric signal at 130 Hz. The modulated
    signal is digitally sampled over a prescribed interval, and a Fast Fourier Transform
    is taken. After correcting the harmonic amplitudes for the so-called `picket-fence
    error', their ratios are measured. The displacement is then calculated by reference
    to the ratios between Bessel functions J<sub>2</sub>/J<sub>0</sub>, J<sub>3</sub>/J<sub>1</sub>
    and J<sub>4</sub>/J<sub>2</sub>. An application is described for automated calibration
    of accelerometers at high frequencies. The latter is shown to have accuracy comparable
    to that of methods which establish discrete amplitudes by reference to zeros of
    Bessel functions.</p>"
