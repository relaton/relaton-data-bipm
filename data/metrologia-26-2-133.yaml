abstract:
- content: "<p>A pyrometer is described which is simple and easy to construct, yet
    fulfils the requirements of a standards laboratory which wishes to perform radiation
    thermometry to very high accuracy. A test of its performance is described in which
    it was used to measure the ratio of the spectral radiances at 650 nm of black
    bodies at the melting points of silver and gold. Taking the gold-point temperature
    to be 1064.43 °C, this measurement gave a result of (961.961 ± 0.017) °C (99%
    confidence level) as the value of the silver-point temperature.</p>"
