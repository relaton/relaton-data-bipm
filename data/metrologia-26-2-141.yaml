    <p>International atomic time references, TAI and UTC, are computed by the BIPM from the data of atomic clocks running in various laboratories; they are made available to the time/frequency community and to the potential users. Furthermore, by mid-1988, 15 independent atomic time scales had been established by the laboratories with their own data.</p>
    <p>From the user's point of view, it is worth wondering whether these independent time scales possess specific qualities with respect to the international references.</p>
