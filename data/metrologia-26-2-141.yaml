abstract:
- content: "<p>International atomic time references, TAI and UTC, are computed by
    the BIPM from the data of atomic clocks running in various laboratories; they
    are made available to the time/frequency community and to the potential users.
    Furthermore, by mid-1988, 15 independent atomic time scales had been established
    by the laboratories with their own data.</p><p>From the user's point of view,
    it is worth wondering whether these independent time scales possess specific qualities
    with respect to the international references.</p>"
