  content: "<p>The long-term performance of two active hydrogen masers developed at
    the National Measurement Laboratory of the CSIRO is presented. Six years of comparisons
    between the masers, the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) are summarized. Operating as independent
    clocks the masers showed outstanding long-term performance and consistently high
    weightings in the coordination of major time-keeping centres carried out by the
    BIPM.</p>"
