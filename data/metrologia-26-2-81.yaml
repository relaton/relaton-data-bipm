abstract:
- content: "<p>A high-precision absolute radiometer with a thermally stabilized cavity
    as receiving element has been designed for use in solar irradiance measurements.
    The State Special Standard of the Solar Irradiance Unit has been built on the
    basis of the developed absolute radiometer. The Standard also includes the sun
    tracking system and the system for automatic thermal stabilization and information
    processing, comprising a built-in microcalculator which calculates the irradiance
    according to the input program. During metrological certification of the Standard,
    main error sources have been analysed and the non-excluded systematic and accidental
    errors of the irradiance-unit realization have been determined. The total error
    of the Standard does not exceed 0.3%. Beginning in 1984 the Standard has been
    taking part in a comparison with the Ã… 212 pyrheliometer and other Soviet and
    foreign standards. In 1986 it took part in the international comparison of absolute
    radiometers and standard pyrheliometers of socialist countries. The results of
    the comparisons proved the high metrological quality of this Standard based on
    an absolute radiometer.</p>"
