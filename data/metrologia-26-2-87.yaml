  content: "<p>In optical interferometers illuminated by laser sources the shift of
    the phase and changes in the curvature of the wave fronts lead to systematic errors,
    to which there must be added the error caused by misalignments. In the study described
    in the present article, the interference pattern was obtained from the actual
    amplitude and phase of the interfering wave fronts at the exit aperture of the
    interferometer. With reference to plane-wave illumination, the excess of the period
    of the output signal was obtained in a closed form in the case of small misalignment
    and negligible difference between the optical paths.</p>"
