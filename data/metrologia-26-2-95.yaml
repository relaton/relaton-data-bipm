abstract:
- content: "<p>Determination of the differences between the Kelvin Thermodynamic Temperature
    Scale (KTTS) and the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68)
    in the range from 230°C to 660°C has been accomplished by gas thermometry. The
    estimated random uncertainty of the results ranges from ±0.005°C to ±0.008°C;
    the major uncertainties appear to lie in the determination of the volume of the
    gas bulb and the determination of its IPTS-68 temperature. The present results
    differ noticeably from earlier gas-thermometric determinations in the range of
    temperature overlap. The value found for the thermodynamic temperature of the
    freezing point of Al is (660.342 ± 0.015)°C.</p>"
