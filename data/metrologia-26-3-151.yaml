  content: <p>As a part of preparatory work for the establishment of the new ITS-90
    temperature scale, measurements of thermodynamic temperature by means of a gas
    thermometer without "dead space" were performed. The deviation of the NPL-75 scale
    from thermodynamic temperature was found to lie between zero and 0.7 mK. The value
    for the thermodynamic temperature of the hydrogen normal boiling point was found
    to be only 0.6 mK higher than that of Berry. The deviation of our scale, referenced
    to 273 K, from that of Steur and Durieux does not exceed 0.4 mK from 4.2 K to
    27 K. Independent values of the second virial coefficient in the range 2.5 K to
    27 K were found. In agreement with the results of other workers the deviations
    of the IPTS-68 from thermodynamic temperature were found to be - 8 mK near 20.3
    K and +11 mK near 83 K. The maximal deviation of the IPTS-68 from thermodynamic
    temperature, viz 15 mK, was found near 150 K. This result is 4 mK higher than
    that of Kemp <italic>et al</italic> and lower by the same amount than was measured
    by the total radiation thermometer of Martin <italic>et al</italic>. The new values
    found for the thermodynamic temperatures of the fixed points are in good agreement
    with the results of other workers. The reference function <italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic>)
    for a standard platinum resistance thermometer is calculated.</p>
