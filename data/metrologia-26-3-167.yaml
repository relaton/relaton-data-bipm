  content: "<p>Freezing and melting behaviour of our silver sample was studied using
    conventional procedures and also using conditions that were nearly adiabatic in
    order to obtain an equilibrium melting curve. The results indicate that the freezing
    point of a silver sample of six-9s purity is reproducible well within one millikelvin,
    provided that experimental conditions to realize it are reproduced. the melting
    range from 10% liquid to the liquidus point is about 28 mK, and the freezing point
    obtained following a supercool can be one to several mK below the liquidus point,
    depending upon the freezing technique used.</p>"
