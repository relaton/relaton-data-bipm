abstract:
- content: "<p>Some high-temperature platinum resistance thermometers were tested
    at the IMGC to evaluate the performance in different furnaces and environments
    between 980 °C and 1080 °C. They exhibited a large instability when maintained
    in close contact with an Inconel-600 environment, suggesting that their silica
    sheaths might be permeable to metal vapour released by Inconel. Different experiments
    were carried out to investigate the phenomenon by exposing some pure platinum
    wires sealed in silica capsules to an Inconel environment at 1080 °C. First, the
    exposed platinum wires were analysed with the neutron activation analysis method
    to determine the contamination from the environment; and after, the effects of
    surrounding gas on the diffusion of metal vapours through the silica sheaths were
    examined by means of radiotracers from an activated Inconel source. All the experiments
    demonstrated that at high temperature the silica sheaths are permeable to metal
    vapours, thus the platinum resistance thermometers can be easily contaminated
    by a metal environment.</p>"
