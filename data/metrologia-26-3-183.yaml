abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures has initiated world-wide
    intercomparisons of pressure standards. The intercomparison in the regime of very
    low pressures, i.e. 10<sup>-4</sup> to 1 Pa, using Ar as the test gas, has now
    been completed with the participation of laboratories in nine countries (in alphabetical
    order): Czechoslovakia, Federal Republic of Germany, France, India, Italy, Japan,
    People's Republic of China, UK and United States of America. In addition, five
    of these laboratories made measurements using H<sub>2</sub> as the test gas. Four
    spinning-rotor gauges were employed as transfer standards. The achieved transfer
    uncertainty between the pilot laboratory (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt)
    and a participating laboratory lies between 0.16% and 0.30% (1σ) for Ar and has
    allowed an intercomparison at this level of accuracy. At all investigated pressures
    the standards in the various laboratories lie within an interval of ±3% around
    the standard of the pilot laboratory. For a brief synopsis of the intercomparison
    results, the calibration data of each laboratory for one gas species are reduced
    to a single number, i.e., the average over the pressure range 10<sup>-3</sup>
    to 1 Pa, although this procedure is somewhat arbitrary and obscures scatter and
    pressure-dependence of some calibration results. These averages deviate from their
    mean by not more than about 1%. Systematic deviations between some laboratories
    are clearly identifiable: however, for most of the laboratories it appears that
    these are compatible with the estimated uncertainties of the pressure generation
    and the transfer uncertainty.</p>"
