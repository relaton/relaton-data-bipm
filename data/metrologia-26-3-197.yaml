abstract:
- content: "<p>The current distribution at the contact to the two-dimensional electron
    gas has been measured using a specially designed sample geometry. Possible influence
    of the contacts on magnetotransport measurements has been studied with emphasis
    on the current distribution in the quantum Hall regime. Finally, we propose a
    way of optimizing the contact geometry for accurate measurement of the quantized
    Hall resistance.</p>"
