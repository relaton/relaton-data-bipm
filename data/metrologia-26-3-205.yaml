    <p>The manganese K-shell fluorescence yield (ω<sub>K</sub>) in the <sup>55</sup>Fe decay for two thermally evaporated sources was measured using absolute measurement methods for the activity and the K X-ray emission rate with the national primary standard at VNIIM.</p>
    <p>The mean value obtained is ω<sub>K</sub> = 0.312 ± 0.003 which agrees with a semiempirical value of ω<sub>K</sub> = 0.314 ± 0.023 within the limits of measurement uncertainty.</p>
