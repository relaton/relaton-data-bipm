abstract:
- content: "<p>The manganese K-shell fluorescence yield (ω<sub>K</sub>) in the<sup>55</sup>Fe
    decay for two thermally evaporated sources was measured using absolute measurement
    methods for the activity and the K X-ray emission rate with the national primary
    standard at VNIIM.</p><p>The mean value obtained is ω<sub>K</sub> = 0.312 ± 0.003
    which agrees with a semiempirical value of ω<sub>K</sub> = 0.314 ± 0.023 within
    the limits of measurement uncertainty.</p>"
