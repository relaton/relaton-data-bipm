abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Electrotechnical Commission is currently revising
    its specification for the method of realizing the standard of sound pressure.
    To provide information on the consistency of present standards worldwide, an intercomparison
    was organized in which sixteen national standards laboratories each sent a pair
    of one-inch microphones to the NPL for calibration. This paper presents the results
    of the intercomparison which show that there is broad agreement between laboratories
    within the uncertainties claimed.</p>"
