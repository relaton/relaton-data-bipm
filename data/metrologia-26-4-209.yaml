abstract:
- content: "<p>The completion of Volume 26, 1989, marked the end of my tenure as Editor
    of Metrologia. My association with the journal, its parent body the Comit√© International
    des Poids et Mesures, its host organization the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures, the publishers Springer-Verlag and last (but by no means least) the
    Editorial Board, has been a pleasant one and I trust that the subscribers will
    have found the product to be generally satisfactory.</p><p>There have been, it
    is true, some disappointments along the way and I shall mention two of these while
    expressing the hope that the new Editor will enjoy a greater success in their
    regard.</p><p>First is the question of circulation, which has stayed dangerously
    low, although the shrinkage has tapered off in the most recent years. Because
    of the narrow public support, the costs of production are relatively high and
    this, through a consequently high subscription rate, tends to enshrine the unsatisfactory
    state of affairs. Modest schemes to broaden the journal's appeal and bring in
    a wider readership have foundered upon the first step, namely, that of procuring
    from staff members of the national standards laboratories the hoped-for articles
    which would discuss the state of the art in delivering the highest-quality measurement
    services to the public. However, some very interesting and bolder schemes are
    presently under discussion.</p><p>I had also hoped to leaven the journal's content
    a little by regularly appearing articles on the latest developments within the
    great national laboratories. But, as with technical review articles, it has proven
    very difficult to find the right authors who can also spare the time, and only
    a few laboratories have found it possible to collaborate.</p><p>In taking my leave,
    it remains for me to thank all the contributors, referees and readers for their
    support, to express the hope of an ever brighter future for Metrologia and to
    wish to the new Editor, Dr D A Blackburn, a happy and successful tenure.</p>"
