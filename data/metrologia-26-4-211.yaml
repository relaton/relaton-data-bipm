  content: "<p>The freezing-point temperatures of two samples of 99.9999% pure indium
    in cells constructed such that the indium was in contact only with Teflon were
    measured with four standard platinum resistance thermometers and two resistance
    bridges, one bridge operating at 400 Hz and the other with square-wave dc. Although
    nominally of the same purity, one sample was purer than the other, with a difference
    in freezing-point temperature of 0.2 to 0.4 mK, the value depending on the bridge
    used for the measurements. The temperature, <italic>t</italic><sub>68</sub>, of
    the purer sample as determined from dc measurements is (156.6342 ± 0.0004) °C
    and as determined from ac measurements is (156.6345 ± 0.0004) °C. The pressure
    dependence was determined to be (4.92 ± 0.05) mK/(std. atm). Consequently, the
    triple-point temperatures are (4.92 ± 0.05) mK lower than the freezing-point values.
    The indium freezing-point temperature would be a suitable defining fixed point
    for a temperature scale.</p>"
