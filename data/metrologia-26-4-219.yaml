abstract:
- content: "<p>A tridimensional, non-linear, finite-element analysis, supplementing
    a previous bidimensional linear analysis, was applied to characterize the performance
    of a zerodur translation device for X-ray fringe scanning. The effects of errors
    deriving from machining tolerances or of parasitic force components are taken
    into account. Optimization criteria indicate that residual tilt angles can be
    reduced to less than 1 nrad over a displacement of 120 μm, obtained with a driving
    force of about 1 N. Each point of the upper platform moves in the vertical plane
    along an almost circular trajectory.</p>"
