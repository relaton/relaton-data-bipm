  content: "<p>The laboratory or as-maintained ohm representations of the National
    Measurement Laboratory in Australia and the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology in the United States have been compared by four different methods.
    These methods involved the transport and intercomparison, over a fifteen-month
    time period, of three 1 Ω resistors on two occasions, one 10 kΩ resistor, three
    10 pF capacitors on two occasions, and one quantized Hall device. The excellent
    agreement of the comparisons of the ohm representations Ω<sub>NML</sub> and Ω<sub>NIST</sub>
    obtained by the four methods provides rigorous tests of the accuracies of fifteen
    different measurement systems used at the two laboratories. The weighted mean
    of the difference between Ω<sub>NML</sub> and Ω<sub>NIST</sub> was found to be
    (1.3664±0.0081) ppm for 1 January 1986.</p>"
