abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental method has been tested to compare impurity levels in
    iodine cells used in the saturated-absorption stabilization of lasers. The method
    is based on the use of the Stern-Volmer formula where the laser-induced fluorescence
    of iodine is studied as a function of pressure. Measurements of a number of iodine
    cells are included as a demonstration and test of this experimental method. The
    frequency shift has been measured for each cell using beat frequencies and saturated
    absorption, and has been related empirically to the Stern-Volmer formula. It is
    found that the method is appropriate for cells with low to moderate concentration
    of impurities.</p>"
