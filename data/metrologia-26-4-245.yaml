  content: "<p>The thermodynamic temperatures of the freezing points of silver and
    gold have been measured relative to the aluminium point with a photoelectric pyrometer
    of effective wavelength about 974 nm. The values obtained are 1234.927 K ± 0.018
    K and 1337.330 K ± 0.022 K respectively. These results are based on the value
    of -64.3 mK for <italic>T-T</italic><sub>68</sub> at 730 K, recommended by the
    working group IV of the CCT in Dec. 1988 to take into account the most recent
    results of the gas thermometry of Edsinger and Schooley. The overall uncertainties
    are given at 68.3% confidence limits.</p>"
