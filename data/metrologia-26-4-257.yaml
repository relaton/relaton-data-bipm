  content: "<p>The results of an international comparison of iodine-stabilized He-Ne
    lasers at 633 nm, made by beat-frequency techniques, between the NRLM (Japan)
    and the BIPM are presented. During two weeks the frequency of the two lasers NRLM1
    and BIPM4 were compared twice a day. The mean frequency difference was determined
    to be Δ<italic>f</italic> = [0.9 ± 2.6] kHz, corresponding to a relative frequency
    difference of [2 ± 5] · 10<sup>-12</sup>. Parameters which affected the frequency
    of the lasers such as modulation width, iodine pressure and laser power were also
    investigated. As the laser BIPM4 was compared with the laser BIPM2 at the BIPM
    before and after the travel to the NRLM, we can link our results to the previous
    international comparisons in which the BIPM has participated.</p>"
