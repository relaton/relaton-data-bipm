abstract:
- content: '<p>Since its first issue in 1965 Metrologia has had just three editors,
    a history of tenure which suggests that those who hold the post find in it sufficient
    to interest, occupy, challenge and amuse them. I see no reason to doubt that this
    happy circumstance will continue and look forward to my own period as editor with
    the intention of retaining, insofar as I am able to interpret them, the best traditions
    the journal has established so far.</p><p>As I take up my editorial duties I have
    become aware that surrounding Metrologia there is a small community of authors,
    reviewers and readers on whose support the success of the journal entirely depends.
    It is a community in which the roles change daily with some of its members engaged,
    even simultaneously, as reader, reviewer and author. I am well aware that the
    goodwill extended to me as I enter this community is in no small part due the
    efforts of the outgoing editor, Dr Ralph Hudson, whose easy, engaging and courteous,
    yet firm, relationship with authors and reviewers emerges clearly from editorial
    correspondence. I thank him for that he has done and wish him an active and happy
    retirement.</p><p>A short foray into the records of Metrologia shows - in the
    first editorial - that four main kinds of article were originally envisaged: research
    articles likely to contribute to progress in fundamental scientific measurements,
    reports of experiments or techniques of particular importance or originality in
    the area of secondary measurement, articles concerning the decisions of the Comité
    International des Poids et Mesures, and review articles. No balance was specified
    but a priority was assigned to articles dealing with fundamental metrology.</p><p>Of
    the four categories, the first two represent the core of Metrologia''s activity
    and largely determine its reputation as a publication. For this reason, editorial
    implementation of the policy set by the CIPM is mainly exercised through the operation
    of a reviewing system which is intentionally strict. The effect of this is two
    fold: reviewers are drawn from the metrological community and know that a high
    standard is required, while authors know that good work dealing with fine measurements
    will be read and appreciated by those who know the field. Articles in the third
    category have appeared regularly in Metrologia. The continuing association with
    the CIPM is well exemplified, in this issue, by the article from Dr Hugh Preston-Thomas
    - President of the CCT, Vice-President of the CIPM and a former editor - on The
    International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) and by "News from the BIPM".
    Last year, a major article described the new international electrical reference
    standards. Only the fourth category of article presents problems: with honourable
    exceptions - the 1987 supplement by Prof. George Gillies on the Newtonian Gravitational
    Constant, for example - the reviews promised in 1965 are absent.</p><p>As the
    new editor my thoughts have come to centre on the matter of reviews. This, I find,
    is not a unique consideration, for my predecessor raised the matter in his own
    introductory editorial some years ago. The intention of the original Editorial
    Board was: ''Review articles will be published... in order that both the specialist
    and the nonspecialist may have a convenient and readily available means of surveying
    the rapidly changing situation in fundamental metrology''. This seems a wholly
    admirable intention and one that should not be forgotten. I ask potential authors
    to think about reviews on topics of current interest and to contact me or any
    member of the Editorial Board to discuss possibilities. I''d also be interested
    to have the names of individuals I could approach in the name of Metrologia with
    a view to asking them to write on a particular topic. Intending authors will have
    all the support - moral rather than financial, I fear - that the editorial office
    can provide.</p><p>Finally, I ask readers to note that the pages of Metrologia
    are open to all. "Letters to the Editor" provides a forum for debate on metrological
    matters and, within the constraints of a quarterly journal, offers rapid publication
    for short items of topical interest. Letters may take the form of comments on
    articles published, short descriptions of original work, brief notes on matters
    of wide interest, new issues in the field of metrology or new views on old ones.
    Particularly welcome will be new possibilities for the improvement of scientific
    measurement and the exchange of views thereon. The possibilities are not circumscribed,
    so long as they are likely to be of interest to those whose concern is to advance
    understanding in the field of fine measurement.</p>'
