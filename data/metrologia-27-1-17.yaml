abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate mass determination of multiples of a unit may be attained
    by employing design matrices which lead to orthogonal systems of normal equations.
    The ratio which exists between the highest mass of the set and the standard (unit)
    is utilized to circumvent the condition which states that the orthogonality of
    a system can be realized only if the highest mass is the defining standard. The
    basic principle of this operation is briefly mentioned in the article `Systematic
    Search for Orthogonal Systems, in the Calibration of Submultiples and Multiples
    of the Unit of Mass', 1980 Metrologia 16 51-54.</p>"
