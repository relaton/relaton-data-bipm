  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The frequencies of six iodine-stabilized He-Ne-lasers developed at
    the UPT have been compared with one of the PTB lasers. The lasers were operated
    at λ = 633 nm. Their frequencies were stabilized to the line centres of hyperfine
    structure (hfs) components of the R(127) 11-5 absorption line of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    using the third-harmonic detection technique. The stabilized frequencies of the
    UPT lasers averaged for each laser over the four hfs components d, e, f, and g
    are distributed in two groups. The frequencies of one group of three lasers are
    close to the frequency of the PTB laser with maximum deviations of +4 kHz to -9
    kHz. The frequencies of the other three lasers are offset by -38 kHz with deviations
    of +8 kHz to -4 kHz. The maximum frequency deviations between all six lasers are
    approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the uncertainties of the recommended
    wavelength values [1] for this laser system, demonstrating its high potential
    for the realization of the metre and for high-precision spectroscopy.</p>"
