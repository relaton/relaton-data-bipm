abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of the regular spectral transmittance scales of
    NIST, Gaithersburg, MD (USA); PTB, Braunschweig (FRG); NPL, Teddington, Middlesex
    (UK); and OMH, Budapest (H) was accomplished using three sets of neutral glass
    filters with transmittances ranging from approximately 0.92 to 0.001. The difference
    between the results from the reference spectrophotometers of the laboratories
    was generally smaller than the total uncertainty of the interchange. The relative
    total uncertainty ranges from 0.05% to 0.75% for transmittances from 0.92 to 0.001.
    The sample-induced error was large - contributing 40% or more of the total except
    in a few cases.</p>"
