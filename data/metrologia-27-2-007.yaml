abstract:
- content: "<p>``Melting'' and ``freezing'' behaviour of Ga-In eutectic has been studied
    in order to find the reason for the observed irreproducibility of the ``melting''
    and ``freezing'' points of binary eutectics. It is shown that reproducible results
    can be obtained using techniques of static adiabatic calorimetry and that dynamic
    methods are inappropriate if one intends to realize liquidus points of eutectics
    reproducibly with the accuracy necessary for high precision thermometry. The liquidus
    temperature of Ga-In eutectic was found to be 15.654Â°C. The eutectic composition
    is 20.5% In in Ga by weight. This value was obtained by assuming that the heat
    of fusion per unit mass is maximum at the eutectic composition. The value is 74
    J/g.</p>"
