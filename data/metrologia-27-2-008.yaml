abstract:
- content: "<p>The change of the apparent mass of 20-g masses and tubes that are not
    in thermal equilibrium with ambient air has been observed. Buoyancy, adsorption
    and convection influences are discussed. Quantitative comparisons show that, under
    such conditions, it is predominantly free convection forces which change the apparent
    mass.</p>"
