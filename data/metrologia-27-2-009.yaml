abstract:
- content: "<p>Argon triple point calibration facilities have been compared among
    eight laboratories with one transfer system, employing local long-stem standard
    platinum resistance thermometers. The apparatus intercompared, included a sealed
    cell and its associated cryostat. As is evidenced by the results of long-term
    investigations, previously performed at the INM, cells of the type employed may
    show a triple-point temperature, which is stable within the reproducibility of
    the measurements (≃0,1 mK) over a period of about 10 years. At each laboratory
    the mean difference between the Argon triple-point temperature of the transfer
    cell (t) and the local cell (i) has been determined, using a standard resistance
    thermometer previously calibrated at the fixed points, according to the IPTS-68;
    associated repeatabilities are typically of the order of 0,1 mK. The reproducibility
    attained by measuring the mean difference in different laboratories, using cells
    of the same type and origin (INM), amounts to 0,4 mK.</p>"
