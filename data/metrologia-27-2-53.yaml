  content: "<p>A versatile combined primary standard of the USSR has been established
    at VNIIOFI for the realization of radiometric units. The standard is based on
    two black bodies, operable at temperatures from 400 to 3000 K, and an absolute
    radiometer. Units of both spectral and broadband quantities are reproduced within
    the 0,2 μm to 25 μm range. A black-body radiator made of niobium carbide and graphite
    is used over the temperature range of 1500-3000 K, while that for the lower temperatures
    from 400 to 1200 K is a heat-pipe with a sodium heat-transfer medium. In order
    to determine the thermodynamic temperature <italic>T</italic> of the high-temperature
    black body, relative values of radiant flux <italic>P</italic><sub>e</sub> (<italic>T</italic><sub>i</sub>)
    and spectral radiance <italic>L</italic><sub>eλ</sub> (λ<sub>i</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>i</sub>)
    at several temperatures <italic>T</italic><sub>i</sub> are found. The method allows
    realization of radiometric and photometric quantities irrespective of the International
    Practical Temperature Scale (IPTS-68). The absolute radiometer used is of a special
    design and has a control system capable of maintaining the conical receiving cavity
    at constant temperature throughout the measurement process. The absolute radiometer
    is intended to realize radiometric units as well as to measure the spectral sensitivity
    of radiation receivers.</p>"
