abstract:
- content: "<p>A versatile combined primary standard of the USSR has been established
    at VNIIOFI for the realization of radiometric units. The standard is based on
    two black bodies, operable at temperatures from 400 to 3000 K, and an absolute
    radiometer. Units of both spectral and broadband quantities are reproduced within
    the 0,2 μm to 25 μm range. A black-body radiator made of niobium carbide and graphite
    is used over the temperature range of 1500-3000 K, while that for the lower temperatures
    from 400 to 1200 K is a heat-pipe with a sodium heat-transfer medium. In order
    to determine the thermodynamic temperature T of the high-temperature black body,
    relative values of radiant flux P<sub>e</sub> (T<sub>i</sub>) and spectral radiance
    L<sub>eλ</sub> (λ<sub>i</sub>, T<sub>i</sub>) at several temperatures T<sub>i</sub>
    are found. The method allows realization of radiometric and photometric quantities
    irrespective of the International Practical Temperature Scale (IPTS-68). The absolute
    radiometer used is of a special design and has a control system capable of maintaining
    the conical receiving cavity at constant temperature throughout the measurement
    process. The absolute radiometer is intended to realize radiometric units as well
    as to measure the spectral sensitivity of radiation receivers.</p>"
