  content: "<p>The paper concerns the frequency stabilization of an Ar<sup>+</sup>
    laser at 514.5 nm to saturated absorption resonances in an external luminescent
    I<sub>2</sub> cell. With the laser frequency stabilised to the hyperfine component,
    <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>, a long-term stability Δ<italic>v/v</italic> =
    5 × 10<sup>-15</sup> has been achieved for τ = 100 s. The laser linewidth is Δ<italic>v</italic>
    ≃ 5 kHz. The factors affecting the frequency reproducibility of an Ar<sup>+</sup>
    laser have been explored.</p>"
