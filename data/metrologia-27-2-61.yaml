abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper concerns the frequency stabilization of an Ar<sup>+</sup>
    laser at 514.5 nm to saturated absorption resonances in an external luminescent
    I<sub>2</sub> cell. With the laser frequency stabilised to the hyperfine component,
    a<sub>2</sub>, a long-term stability Δv/v = 5 × 10<sup>-15</sup> has been achieved
    for τ = 100 s. The laser linewidth is Δv ≃ 5 kHz. The factors affecting the frequency
    reproducibility of an Ar<sup>+</sup> laser have been explored.</p>"
