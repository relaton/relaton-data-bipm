  content: "<p>In the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), a research test
    facility for the accurate measurement of gas (volume and mass) flowrates has been
    set up in the last few years on the basis of a laser Doppler anemometer (LDA)
    with a view to directly measuring gas flowrates with a relative uncertainty of
    only 0,1%. To achieve this, it was necessary to develop laser Doppler anemometry
    into a precision measuring technique and to carry out detailed investigations
    on stationary low-turbulence nozzle flow. The process-computer controlled test
    facility covers the flowrate range from 100 to 4000 m<sup>3</sup>/h (~0,03 - 1,0
    m<sup>3</sup>/s), any flowrate being measured directly, immediately and without
    staggered arrangement of several flow meters. After the development was completed,
    several turbine-type gas meters were calibrated and international comparisons
    carried out. The article surveys the most significant aspects of the work and
    provides an outlook on future developments with regard to the miniaturization
    of optical flow and flowrate sensors for industrial applications.</p>"
