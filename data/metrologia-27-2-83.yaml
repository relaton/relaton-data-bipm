abstract:
- content: "<p>Data relating the resistance of high temperature platinum resistance
    thermometers with thermodynamic temperatures, which were independent from those
    used to derive ITS-90, have been compared with ITS-90. Within the accuracy of
    the photoelectric pyrometry involved, ±0,40°C at the freezing point of silver,
    the measured thermodynamic temperatures agreed with the temperatures obtained
    using the ITS-90. In measurements performed during a 1,5 year period the typical
    random uncertainties, evidenced by variations in the resistance of platinum resistance
    thermometers at the triple point of water, were equivalent to ±0,015°C at the
    freezing point of silver, whilst, in this period, the drifts in the measured values
    of the resistance ratio at the freezing point of silver were equivalent to 0,03°C.</p>"
