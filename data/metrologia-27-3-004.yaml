abstract:
- content: "<p>A new approach to accelerometer calibration is presented which is applicable
    to frequencies from 1 mHz to above 25 kHz and to amplitudes from 1 nm to above
    10 m. Heterodyne laser interferometry is used to measure dynamically the position
    of the vibrating accelerometer as a function of phase angle through the vibration
    cycle. Coherent integration is used to improve the length resolution and noise
    immunity, and a complete description of the vibration is obtained by Fourier analysis
    of the position measurements. Insensitivity to distortion is achieved by measuring
    the accelerometer voltage simultaneously in a similar manner and calculating the
    accelerometer sensitivity from the fundamental length and voltage amplitudes.
    One implementation of this approach is described and shown to be capable of calibrating
    accelerometers in the frequency range 5 Hz to 5 kHz with a least uncertainty in
    amplitude of Â±0,01 nm.</p>"
