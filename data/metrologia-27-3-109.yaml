    <p>Beginning in January of next year  <italic>Metrologia</italic> will be published by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. This does not mean that a new journal is being created: externally the journal may have changed a little, but internally any changes will be of form rather than of substance.  <italic>Metrologia</italic> was intended originally as a vehicle that would permit the metrological community to communicate progress in fundamental scientific measurements, to report original experiments and techniques in the area of secondary measurement, to review work in specialist fields and to disseminate the decisions of the Comité International des Poids et Mesures. The promotion of these activities remains the central objective of editorial policy.</p>
    <p>The separation from our friends in Springer-Verlag is one we view with some regret and not a little trepidation. On the days when things were not going well in the editorial office at the BIPM it was always a source of comfort to remember the willingness and professionalism with which our colleagues at Springer-Verlag supported the production and distribution of the journal. For some time, however, it has been felt at the BIPM that the Bureau should take direct responsibility for all aspects of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>. This feeling led to discussions on the future of the journal and in June to the decision to separate.</p>
    <p>For those of us at the BIPM, the change represents an occasion to review the activities and priorities of the journal and so to revivify it. Our hope is to retain the best features of the existing  <italic>Metrologia</italic> and to add to them others which will both expand the readership and bring to the journal a yet greater fraction of the finest articles on the topic of precise measurement.</p>
    <p><bold>Publisher's Note</bold></p>
    <p>The first issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> was published in 1965. That issue, as have been all others since, was published by Springer-Verlag "under the Auspices of the International Committee for Weights and Measures". This phrase is the public expression of what has become a long standing and friendly working partnership in which the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) provides the editorial input to the journal and Springer-Verlag turns it into a publication suitable for circulation in the scientific community.</p>
    <p>According to the desire expressed by the BIPM it was decided in recent discussions between the BIPM and Springer-Verlag that beginning with the first issue of Volume 28, scheduled to appear in January 1991,  <italic>Metrologia</italic> will be published by the BIPM. Springer Verlag wish the Bureau every success.</p>
