abstract:
- content: '<p>Beginning in January of next year Metrologia will be published by the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. This does not mean that a new journal
    is being created: externally the journal may have changed a little, but internally
    any changes will be of form rather than of substance. Metrologia was intended
    originally as a vehicle that would permit the metrological community to communicate
    progress in fundamental scientific measurements, to report original experiments
    and techniques in the area of secondary measurement, to review work in specialist
    fields and to disseminate the decisions of the Comité International des Poids
    et Mesures. The promotion of these activities remains the central objective of
    editorial policy.</p><p>The separation from our friends in Springer-Verlag is
    one we view with some regret and not a little trepidation. On the days when things
    were not going well in the editorial office at the BIPM it was always a source
    of comfort to remember the willingness and professionalism with which our colleagues
    at Springer-Verlag supported the production and distribution of the journal. For
    some time, however, it has been felt at the BIPM that the Bureau should take direct
    responsibility for all aspects of Metrologia. This feeling led to discussions
    on the future of the journal and in June to the decision to separate.</p><p>For
    those of us at the BIPM, the change represents an occasion to review the activities
    and priorities of the journal and so to revivify it. Our hope is to retain the
    best features of the existing Metrologia and to add to them others which will
    both expand the readership and bring to the journal a yet greater fraction of
    the finest articles on the topic of precise measurement.</p><p>Publisher''s Note</p><p>The
    first issue of Metrologia was published in 1965. That issue, as have been all
    others since, was published by Springer-Verlag "under the Auspices of the International
    Committee for Weights and Measures". This phrase is the public expression of what
    has become a long standing and friendly working partnership in which the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) provides the editorial input to the
    journal and Springer-Verlag turns it into a publication suitable for circulation
    in the scientific community.</p><p>According to the desire expressed by the BIPM
    it was decided in recent discussions between the BIPM and Springer-Verlag that
    beginning with the first issue of Volume 28, scheduled to appear in January 1991,
    Metrologia will be published by the BIPM. Springer Verlag wish the Bureau every
    success.</p><p>The Publisher</p>'
