  content: "<p>The use of Linear, Ordinary Least-Squares Estimation in mass metrology
    leads to singular normal equations. In the classic approach the singularity is
    avoided by using the method of the Lagrange Multipliers. A Gauss-Markov approach
    is suggested instead and its effects on the estimates and on their covariance
    matrix are discussed. A practical application is presented.</p>"
