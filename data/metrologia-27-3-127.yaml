  content: "<p>Highly pure silicon crystals with an almost perfect lattice structure
    constitute a powerful metrological tool. In real Si-crystals lattice spacings
    with an accuracy better than 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> are realized. These have
    been applied as length standards in the sub-nanometer region using the scanning
    X-ray interferometer, and as angle standards in the nanorad region with angle
    X-ray interferometers. Crystallographic angles between different sets of lattice
    planes within the same crystal differ only slightly (1 × 10<sup>-9</sup> rad)
    from values calculated for the perfect crystal. In a double-crystal arrangement
    Si-crystals have been used as a single-crystal polygon in order to calibrate optical
    angle encoders.</p>"
