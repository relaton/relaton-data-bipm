abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of international comparisons of density measurements are
    reported. Participants include the national laboratories of Australia, the Federal
    Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the United States, as well as the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The comparisons involve hydrostatic
    density determinations of samples made of single-crystal silicon and samples made
    of stainless steel. Agreement among laboratories is generally better for samples
    of silicon than for samples of stainless steel. Overall discrepancies do not,
    however, appear to be serious with respect to scientific and metrological needs.</p>"
