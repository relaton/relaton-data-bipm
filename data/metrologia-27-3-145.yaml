  content: "<p>A modelling procedure is introduced for improvement of the reduction
    of data with the least-squares method, when the data are subdivided in series
    and cannot be considered as replicated. It combines both the advantage of preserving
    the individuality of each series and that of improving the variance estimate which
    arises from fitting the overall data. The procedure assumes - and includes in
    the model - a translational bias for every series. The method has been applied
    to a thermal expansion database of copper below 300 K and to high-accuracy low-temperature
    gas thermometry data, using several least-squares solvers.</p>"
