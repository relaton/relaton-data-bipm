  content: "<p>It is shown that stability of the lamp (filament) resistance is a good
    means for assessing when a tungsten strip-filament lamp with a water-thermostated
    base, used as a secondary temperature standard, has reached thermal equilibrium.
    Lamp current stability is insufficient. The times to reach equilibrium within
    10 mK are longer than has been supposed.</p>"
