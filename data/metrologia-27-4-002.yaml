abstract:
- content: "<p>Mechanical and electrical power in SI units have been equated by measurements
    made on a coil part of which is in a strong magnetic field. The force due to a
    current I flowing in the coil, is weighed by opposing it with a mass M subject
    to the earth's gravitational acceleration g. This is combined with a separate
    measurement in which a voltage V is generated in the coil when it is moved vertically
    with velocity u through the relationship IV = M g u.</p><p>If the current produces
    a voltage V across a resistor whose value R is known in SI units, then V = (M
    g u R)<sup>1/2</sup>. Hence the voltage V and the current I are known in SI units
    and can be used to express the value of the NPL working standards in SI units.
    The working standard of voltage has hitherto been maintained in terms of a Josephson
    effect apparatus by ascribing the value 483 594 GHz/volt (maintained) to the Josephson
    constant K<sub>J</sub> presumed equal to 2e/h. The measurements reported here
    suggest a different value of K<sub>J</sub> 483 597,903 ± 0,035 ought to be used,
    based on the premise that the SI value of the quantum Hall resistance is R<sub>K</sub>
    = 25 812,8092 ± 0,0014 Ω.</p><p>If one presumed also that R<sub>K</sub> = h/e<sup>2</sup>
    exactly, the values of elementary charge e and the Planck constant, h, which may
    be deduced from these measurements are e = 1,602 176 35 ± 0,000 000 14 × 10<sup>-19</sup>
    C, h = 6,626 068 21 ± 0,000 000 90 × 10<sup>-34</sup> J s, which may be compared
    with the values recommended by the CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants
    which are e = 1,602 177 33 ± 0,000 000 14 × 10<sup>-19</sup> C, h = 6,626 075
    5 ± 0,000 004 0 × 10<sup>-34</sup> J s.</p>"
