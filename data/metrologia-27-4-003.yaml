abstract:
- content: "<p>The variance in the mean of a sequence of partially correlated measurements
    is obtained in terms of the transfer function for a system whose input is a steady
    signal plus white noise. Two new expressions are derived in the frequency domain
    and shown to be equivalent to the time domain expression. These expressions are
    amenable to approximation and computation, show clearly the effect of aliasing,
    and are useful in devising strategies to reduce the variance. Their usefulness
    is demonstrated by considering the ideal averaging filter and the RC filter. The
    application of these results to the use of radiometers for the measurement of
    power is discussed.</p>"
