abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>This issue marks the end of a long-standing association between the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures and our publishers, Springer-Verlag. Beginning with volume 28, Metrologia will be published by the BIPM.</p><p>No change of editorial policy is implied by the change of publisher. In 1991, however, the usual four research issues will be supplemented. A review issue will provide an international perspective on progress in Nanometrology and a conference issue will report the proceedings of the meeting on 'New Developments and Advances in Optical Radiometry III', held in Davos, Switzerland, 20–22 September 1990. Our intention is that this pattern of four regular issues supplemented by one review and one conference issue will be maintained from now on.</p><p>We bid farewell to our friends at Springer-Verlag and thank them for their help, advice
    and friendly cooperation over the years.</p>
