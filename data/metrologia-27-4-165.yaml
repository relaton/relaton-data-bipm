    <p>The thermal expansion of pure water having natural isotopic abundance was determined by the dilatometric method in a temperature range from 0 to 85 °C and under a pressure of 101 325 Pa. The following equation was obtained:</p>
    <p>ρ(<italic>t</italic>)/ρ<sub>max</sub> = 1 - [(<italic>t</italic> - 3,98152)<sup>2</sup> (<italic>t</italic> + 396,18534) (<italic>t</italic> + 32,28853)/609 628,6(<italic>t</italic> + 83,12333) (<italic>t</italic> + 30,24455)]</p>
    <p>where ρ(<italic>t</italic>) is the density of water at temperature <italic>t</italic>, which is expressed in terms of the ITS-90, and ρ<sub>max</sub> the maximum density. The density ratio which the above equation gives is estimated to have an uncertainty of approximately 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>
