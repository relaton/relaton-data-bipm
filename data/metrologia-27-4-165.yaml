abstract:
- content: "<p>The thermal expansion of pure water having natural isotopic abundance
    was determined by the dilatometric method in a temperature range from 0 to 85
    °C and under a pressure of 101 325 Pa. The following equation was obtained:</p><p>ρ(t)/ρ<sub>max</sub>
    = 1 - [(t - 3,98152)<sup>2</sup> (t + 396,18534) (t + 32,28853)/609 628,6(t +
    83,12333) (t + 30,24455)]</p><p>where ρ(t) is the density of water at temperature
    t, which is expressed in terms of the ITS-90, and ρ<sub>max</sub> the maximum
    density. The density ratio which the above equation gives is estimated to have
    an uncertainty of approximately 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>"
