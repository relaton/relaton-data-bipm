  content: "<p>Thirteen platinum resistance thermometers were intercompared at several
    fixed points, ten of them between 0 °C and 420 °C and three between 0 °C and 630
    °C. The results were used to assess various equations describing their temperature
    dependence, to comment upon the accuracy of the resulting temperature scale, to
    comment upon the selection of the numerical values assigned to the fixed points,
    to discuss relatively inexpensive calibrations at a single high temperature fixed
    point, and to suggest a practical selection guide for high quality platinum resistance
    thermometers.</p>"
