  content: "<p>Quantum calculations for the second virial coefficients of <sup>3</sup>He
    and <sup>4</sup>He based on an interatomic potential have been refined to the
    point where the accuracy of the calculations is at level which is an order of
    magnitude better than the experimental error associated with the measured virials.
    A new accurate potential has been constructed for the ground state of He<sub>2</sub>
    and new relations for the non-ideality of <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He based
    on this potential are recommended. These relations, which are more physically
    based, appear preferable to those proposed for the International Temperature Scale
    of 1990 (ITS-90). For <sup>4</sup>He the suggested relation for the second virial
    coefficients is almost identical with the corresponding relation of the ITS-90
    scale in the region of applicability (3-25 K) but is more realistic below that
    range. The suggested relation for <sup>3</sup>He second virial coefficients agrees
    more closely with the experimental data (1,47 to 20,1 K) after a correction has
    been made for the presence of third virial coefficients.</p>"
