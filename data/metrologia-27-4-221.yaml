  content: "<p>Fluence measurements made with accelerator-based neutron fields in
    standards laboratories have been compared at neutron energies of 0,144, 0,565,
    2,5, 5,0 and 14,8 MeV. The method used was to compare the neutron sensitivities
    of a pair of fission chambers, one containing <sup>235</sup>U and the other containing
    <sup>238</sup>U fissile deposits. The uncertainty contribution from the transfer
    method is generally smaller than the uncertainty in the fluence determination,
    and the results of the intercomparison are in satisfactory agreement. The weighted
    least squares estimates of the measured chamber neutron sensitivities at each
    energy confirm the ENDF/B-VI evaluations of the fission cross-sections.</p>"
