  content: "<p>An intercomparison of standards of mass of 50 g and 10 g was carried
    out between the national standards laboratories of four European countries during
    the period May 1988 to July 1989. The transfer standards used were carefully selected
    by the pilot laboratory (NPL) and the comparison scheme was chosen to minimise
    the influence of any instability in their mass. The results obtained show good
    agreement to within the uncertainties of measurement of the participants, the
    widest variation in mass value between any two participants being 8 μg at 50 g
    and 3 μg at 10 g.</p>"
