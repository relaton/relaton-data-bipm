abstract:
- content: "<p>Mercury is used as a manometric fluid and as a confining fluid in thermodynamic
    investigations, for which purposes its density and the dependence of its density
    on temperature must be known. The values are affected by changes in the temperature
    scale and have been recalculated on ITS-90.</p>"
