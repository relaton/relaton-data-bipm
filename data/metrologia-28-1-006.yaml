abstract:
- content: "<p>A measurement of the thermal dilatation of pure water has been made
    by detecting the change of buoyancy acting on a cylindrical hollow artifact made
    of fused quartz immersed in water between the temperatures of 0 °C and 44 °C.
    The formula for the thermal dilatation of water, free from air, is obtained in
    terms of the relative density ρ/ρ<sub>0</sub> at the pressure of 101 325 Pa with
    an uncertainty of less than 1 ppm is as follows:</p><p>ρ/ρ<sub>0</sub> = 0,999
    867 75 + 6,786 687 54 × 10<sup>-5</sup>(t/°C) - 9,090 991 73 × 10<sup>-6</sup>(t/°C)<sup>2</sup>
    \n+ 1,025 981 51 × 10<sup>-7</sup>(t/°C)<sup>3</sup> - 1,350 290 42 × 10<sup>-9</sup>(t/°C)<sup>4</sup>
    \n+ 1,326 743 92 × 10<sup>-11</sup>(t/°C)<sup>5</sup> - 6,461 418 × 10<sup>-14</sup>(t/°C)<sup>6</sup></p><p>where
    the temperature of the maximum density ρ<sub>0</sub> is 3,983 4 °C in terms of
    the ITS-90. The uncertainty of the measurement and the derived formula is evaluated
    to be 0,2 to 0,5 ppm in standard deviation for the same temperature range.</p>"
