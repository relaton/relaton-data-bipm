abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison has been made of the frequencies of stabilized
    He-Ne lasers using intracavity saturated absorption of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    at λ = 633 nm in Bratislava (Czechoslovakia).</p><p>This comparison, organized
    by the CSMU (Bratislava), involved at the same time seven laboratories from five
    countries: the ASMW (German Democratic Republic), the CSMU (Bratislava, Czechoslovakia),
    the CSMU (Praha, Czechoslovakia), the CSAV (Brno, Czechoslovakia), the OMH (Hungary),
    the VNIIM (USSR) and the BIPM.</p><p>The range of the frequency differences between
    all the lasers and the two BIPM travelling lasers was from - 15,9 kHz to 8,8 kHz,
    with a mean of Δf = - 3,3 kHz and an estimated standard deviation of 8,5 kHz (4,7
    kHz corresponds to 1 part in 10<sup>11</sup>, in relative terms).</p><p>Using
    the measurements carried out at the BIPM before and after this comparison between
    the travelling lasers BIPM4 and BIPM10 and the stationnary reference laser BIPM2,
    we can link our results to previous international comparisons involving the BIPM.
    Taking into account the values of these measurements, the mean frequency difference
    becomes: Δf = - [1,6 ± 8,2] kHz.</p>"
