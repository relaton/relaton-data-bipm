abstract:
- content: "<p>Interferometric dilatometers at the National Research Laboratory of
    Metrology (NRLM) in Japan and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in UK been
    intercompared by measuring the thermal expansion coefficients of pure polycrystalline
    silicon, a low expansion ceramic (Miraclon) and fused silica (SRM 739). The dilatometers,
    two from each laboratory, were intercompared over their respective operating temperature
    ranges of 250 to 375 K and 290 to 800 K. The results presented in this paper show
    that the agreement for each material is within the combined uncertainties in the
    measurement of each thermal coefficient of expansion.</p>"
