  content: "<p>The density of ambient air has been determined by a straightforward
    experimental method. The apparent masses of two artefacts having about the same
    mass and surface, but different well-known volumes, have been compared by using
    a 1 kg balance in vacuum and in air. The differences of apparent masses and volumes
    yield the air density with a relative uncertainty (1σ) of 5 × 10<sup>-5</sup>.
    From measurements made using a third artefact, surface sorption effects caused
    by the change between vacuum and air conditions gave a coefficient of about 0,2
    μg cm<sup>-2</sup>.</p>"
