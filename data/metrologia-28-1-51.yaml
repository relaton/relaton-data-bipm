abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison is reported of a deadweight pressure tester using gas
    lubrication and the liquidfilled primary pressure State standard, accepted in
    the Soviet Union. The comparison is within the pressure range of 0,02 to 4,0 kPa.
    The standard error of the tester was shown to vary within the range 0,08 to 0,30
    Pa. This portable tester 300 × 190 × 290 mm is intended as a secondary, transfer,
    standard.</p>"
