  content: <p>The International Temperature Scale of 1990, ITS-90, came into effect
    on 1 January 1990, replacing the International Practical Temperature Scale of
    1968, IPTS-68, and the "Echelle Provisoire de Température de 1976 entre 0,5 K
    et 30 K", EPT-76. The present paper reviews the various experimental measurements
    of thermodynamic temperature <italic>T</italic> (often expressed as differences
    (<italic>T - T</italic><sub>68</sub>)) in the range 0,65 K to 1 357,77 K, which
    were available prior to September 1989, and on the basis of which values of temperature
    were adopted in the ITS-90. Estimates are given for the uncertainties in the derivation
    of these values.</p>
