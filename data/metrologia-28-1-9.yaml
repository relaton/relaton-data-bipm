abstract:
- content: <p>The International Temperature Scale of 1990, ITS-90, came into effect
    on 1 January 1990, replacing the International Practical Temperature Scale of
    1968, IPTS-68, and the "Echelle Provisoire de Température de 1976 entre 0,5 K
    et 30 K", EPT-76. The present paper reviews the various experimental measurements
    of thermodynamic temperature T (often expressed as differences (T - T<sub>68</sub>))
    in the range 0,65 K to 1 357,77 K, which were available prior to September 1989,
    and on the basis of which values of temperature were adopted in the ITS-90. Estimates
    are given for the uncertainties in the derivation of these values.</p>
