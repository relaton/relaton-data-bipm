abstract:
- content: '<p>Visually, this issue of  Metrologia differs markedly from those of
    recent years. The cover is changed and the layout of articles is not quite what
    it was before. Older readers, however, may notice that the colour of our new cover
    is that used for the original eleven volumes published in the period 1965-1975.
    The choice is deliberate: this combination of innovation with a respect for older
    forms characterizes the way  Metrologia will operate under its new publisher the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.</p><p>In discussion of the new  Metrologia,
    one decision was firm: our underlying editorial policy remains fixed.  Metrologia
    will remain a primary vehicle through which the metrological community communicates
    progress in fundamental scientific measurements, reports original experiments
    and techniques, reviews work in specialist fields and disseminates the decisions
    of the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures.</p><p>This year, we plan six
    issues. Four will be regular research issues, one, appearing mid-Summer, will
    record the proceedings of the meeting held in Davos, Switzerland 20-22 September
    1990 on "New Developments and Advances in Optical Radiometry III" and another,
    towards the end of the year, will review progress in  Nanometrology. If successful,
    the pattern will be repeated, the intention being that the research issues continue  Metrologia''s
    historical line of interest, the conference issues expose the journal to new authors
    and the review issues realize a long-standing, but largely inactive, objective
    of editorial policy, the provision of retrospective evaluations of important topics
    and the assessment of likely developments in selected aspects of metrology.</p>'
