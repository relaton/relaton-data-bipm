abstract:
- content: "<p>A general formula for the correction arising from the finite speed
    of light is derived for interferometric absolute gravimetry and is applied to
    some gravimeters. To attain an accuracy of a few μGal (1 μGal = 10<sup>-8</sup>
    m/s<sup>2</sup>) level in gravimeters using the direct free-fall method the initial
    velocity should be carefully taken into account, but this correction is not necessary
    in ones which use the symmetric rise-and-fall method.</p>"
