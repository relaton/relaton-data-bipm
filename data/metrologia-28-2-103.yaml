abstract:
- content: "<p>Concentric circular fringes like those of Newton and Haidinger are
    analysed following a new procedure. Errors are attributed to the measurement of
    fringe diameters in the fitting of interference order to diameter. An improved
    fit is obtained by taking into consideration higher terms usually neglected in
    the formula. It is confirmed that results based on this procedure show a systematic
    change of a few hundredths of a fringe relative to those obtained by the conventional
    analysis.</p>"
