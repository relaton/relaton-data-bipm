abstract:
- content: "<p>The existing AT1 algorithm produces a time scale with a fractional
    frequency variation smaller than that of any clock in the ensemble. We are developing
    a modification to AT1 that includes the additional desirable features: automatic
    frequency-step detection, the option to run in an optimal post-processing mode
    and to run with minimal supervision in non-technical environments. These properties
    are facilitated by the inclusion of a Kalman-filter estimate of the frequency
    variance of each clock in the scale. Results are reported from both simulated
    and real clock data to demonstrate automatic frequency-step detection.</p>"
