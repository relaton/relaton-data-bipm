abstract:
- content: "<p>To an ever increasing extent, weighing instruments for the determination
    of masses of more than 50 kg are designed as high-accuracy weighing instruments
    of accuracy class II rather than as medium accuracy weighing instruments of accuracy
    class III. Consequently, the masses required for testing must meet higher accuracy
    requirements. The uncertainty of a 5 t mass scale set up at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) is assessed on the basis of an analysis of the uncertainties
    which can be attained. This mass scale allows masses of 10 kg, 50 kg, 500 kg and
    5 t to be calibrated with relative uncertainties of 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, 6 × 10<sup>-8</sup>,
    3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> and 1,5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>. With their aid, deadweights of
    up to 50 kN for force standard machines can be determined with relative uncertainties
    of 4 × 10<sup>-7</sup>.</p>"
