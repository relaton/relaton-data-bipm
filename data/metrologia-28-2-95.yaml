abstract:
- content: "<p>An account is given of an intercomparison of the optical frequencies
    of I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized He-Ne lasers at 473 THz (633 nm) performed at the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), Sèvres, France during June 12-16,
    1989. The lasers, SP1 and BIPM2, belong to SP, Borås, Sweden and BIPM, respectively.
    It was found in a matrix of frequency difference measurements that laser SP1 differed
    in optical frequency from laser BIPM2 by + 8,0 kHz, with a standard deviation
    of 1,6 kHz and at a one-way intracavity power of 23,7 mW for laser SP1 and 8,3
    mW for laser BIPM2. The reproducibility of the laser SP1 frequency was estimated
    to be ± 20 kHz.</p>"
