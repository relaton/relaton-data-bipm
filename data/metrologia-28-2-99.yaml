  content: "<p>Comparisons of one-volt Josephson-array voltage standards were carried
    out at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The first set of comparisons
    was between two BIPM devices, and the second between one BIPM device and one from
    the Danish Institute of Fundamental Metrology. Two methods were used, one through
    the calibration of a BIPM-built transfer standard, the other being a direct comparison.
    The observed discrepancies were within 1 nV.</p>"
