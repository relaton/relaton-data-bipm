    <p>The Proceedings published in this special issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> are of New Developments and Applications in Optical Radiometry III, a meeting held in Davos, Switzerland, from 20–22 September 1990, organized by the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD). As the title indicates it was the third in a series of such meetings: the first was organized by P V Foukal and took place in 1985 at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., USA; the second was in 1988 at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK, organized by N P Fox and D H Nettleton. The idea of these meetings is to provide a platform to present and discuss developments and problem areas in optical radiometry among scientists working in different fields, such as metrology and solar radiometry. The choice of Davos as the meeting place was favoured by the fact that the 7th International Pyrheliometer Comparison (IPC VII) was held in autumn 1990 at PMOD. Although IPC is mainly technical and aimed at the worldwide standardization of pyrheliometers (radiometers used for solar measurements in meteorology), both communities—metrology and meteorology—have overlapping radiometric interests and a thorough exchange of ideas is important for the advancement of the field. The ever-increasing number of participants reveals the general interest in the topic and the next meeting, planned for spring 1992 in the United States, will be organized by B Guenther of the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md, USA.</p>
    <p>The programme was divided into four sessions: Radiometric Scales, Radiometers and Quantum Detectors, Source Radiometry, and Solar Radiometry and Space Applications. A total of 47 papers were presented and most are published here. All contributions were refereed and cleared for publication by a board of four guest editors, one for each session: J L Gardner, L-P Boivin, D H Nettleton and B R Barkstrom. The pre-eminent value of the editors' work is manifested by the high quality and homogeneity of the papers.</p>
    <p>The success of the meeting is due to the motivation and enthusiasm of all participants, the commitment of the members of the organizing committee and the fine work of the board of editors. All are gratefully acknowledged. Thanks are extended to the Swiss National Science Foundation for supporting some of the participants from Eastern countries.</p>
