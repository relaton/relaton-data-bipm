  content: <p>The history of solar radiometry since the first pyrheliometer of Pouillet
    is presented. After the invention of the Ångström and the Smithsonian pyrheliometers
    around the turn of this century two different "scales" were in use. Comparisons
    with absolute cavity radiometers developed in America and Europe have been performed
    since about 1910 which show remarkably accurate measurements in terms of the SI
    units. However, these results have never been accepted and several rules have
    been established to reference radiation measurements in the meteorological community
    and to remedy the unsatisfactory fact of having different "scales". Unfortunately
    none of these rules led to a reference close to the SI units of irradiance, confusing
    the issue even more. With the advent of modern absolute radiometers in the late
    1960s the situation improved and led to the definition of the World Radiometric
    Reference in use by the meteorological community since 1981. This reference has
    an estimated accuracy of 0,3% and guarantees the worldwide homogeneity of radiation
    measurements within 0,1% precision.</p>
