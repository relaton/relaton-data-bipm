  content: "<p>A high-precision absolute radiometer with a thermally stabilized cavity
    as the receiving element was designed in 1984 at the All-Union Research Institute
    for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI) and used to derive the USSR National
    Special Standard of the solar irradiance unit. Since that time, the radiometer
    has been developed further. The absolute radiometer has taken part in the comparisons
    with the Ã… 212 pyrheliometer and other absolute radiometers and standards of COMECON
    countries. This work has made possible the development of a combined radiometric
    standard based on the absolute radiometer and black-body radiators.</p>"
