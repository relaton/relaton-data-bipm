abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is described to derive a radiometric scale for laser pulse
    energies from a scale for CW laser power. The transfer standard used is a commercial
    glass-disk calorimeter. The sources of measurement uncertainties have been studied
    and methods for the experimental determination of corrections are described. The
    achieved relative uncertainty of the scale is about 0,15%.</p>"
