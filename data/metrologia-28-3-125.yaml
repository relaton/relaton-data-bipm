abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper presents the results of the first comparison between the
    solar radiometric scale, the World Radiometric Reference (WRR) and a Système International
    radiometric scale (SI scale) as disseminated by national standards laboratories,
    in particular, the scale based on the cryogenic radiometer of the National Physical
    Laboratory (NPL). The comparison used a number of transfer standards to act as
    intermediaries between the two scales which limited the overall uncertainty to
    0,07%. The final result shows that the WARR and the NPL SI scale agree to better
    than 0,03%, well within the absolute uncertainty of the two scales.</p>"
