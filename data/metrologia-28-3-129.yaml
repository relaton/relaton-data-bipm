  content: "<p>A new spectral irradiance scale in the near-infrared was realized at
    the NRC in 1989-1990. Electrical-substitution absolute radiometers were used in
    conjunction with interference filters to calibrate FEL and NPL/GEC tungsten halogen
    lamps in the spectral range 700 nm to 1 600 nm. This paper briefly reviews the
    method used and presents a detailed analysis of the theoretical and measurement
    uncertainties involved. Results of the measurements are also discussed briefly.</p>"
