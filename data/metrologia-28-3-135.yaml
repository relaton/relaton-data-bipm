abstract:
- content: "<p>The realization of a new detector-based scale of spectral radiant power
    with an uncertainty of Â± 0,1% is described. The paper reports the use of novel
    dye laser techniques to characterize the spectral responsivity of a number of
    interference filter radiometers. These were used to relate the spectral power
    distribution of a number of incandescent tungsten filament lamps to the spectral
    responsivity scale realized by the NPL cryogenic radiometer. The results of the
    new realization have been compared with the previous NPL spectroradiometric and
    photometric scales, and showed agreement within their estimated uncertainties.</p>"
