abstract:
- content: "<p>The absolute spectral responsivity at some infrared wavelengths of
    two germanium photodiodes has been determined by two different methods: comparison
    with an absolute radiometer (ECPR) and calibration with respect to a black-body
    simulator. The same geometry and spectral width have been used in both methods.
    The results, uncertainty sources and their evaluation, and the agreement between
    the methods, are discussed in this paper.</p>"
