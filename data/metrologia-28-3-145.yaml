  content: "<p>A Lyot filter has been developed which uses precision liquid crystal
    waveplates to achieve tuning of the filter pass band over hundreds of nanometres.
    Tuning is rapid and non-mechanical, and produces a neglible shift in the transmitted
    image. Transmission is high (50%), and can be characterized using the methods
    developed for fixed-wavelength interference filters. Such a filter, coupled with
    a silicon photodiode trap detector whose radiometric response is well known, offers
    a direct method for linking detector-based radiometry and photometry.</p>"
