abstract:
- content: "<p>A pilot international intercomparison of spectral responsivity scales
    at wavelengths important to fibre optics communication was undertaken among national
    laboratories in the USA, the UK, Germany and Australia. Results are reported for
    wavelengths of 800 nm, 850 nm, 1 300 nm and 1 550 nm. Based on this study, a larger
    intercomparison is planned for 1 300 nm and 1 550 nm, using selected germanium
    photodiodes as transfer standards.</p>"
