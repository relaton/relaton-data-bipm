abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryogenic radiometry has already demonstrated an absolute accuracy
    in the measurement of radiant power of about 0,01%. This article describes advances
    in the design of practical black-body radiators and absorbers, in the manufacture
    and measurement of apertures and in the measurement of detector temperature which,
    together, should allow the accuracy to be improved by a further factor of ten.</p>"
