  content: "<p>Two types of electrical substitution radiometers have been developed
    at Cambridge Research and Instrumentation (CRI) for applications in metrology.
    We describe a table-top instrument for calibrating detectors using stabilized
    laser radiation, a high sensitivity instrument for measuring cryogenic black-body
    radiation, and an automated system for calibrating photodiodes and thermopiles
    with several laser lines and a cryogenic radiometer as a reference standard. We
    also discuss performance characteristics of installed instruments.</p>"
