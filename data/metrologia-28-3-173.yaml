  content: "<p>Results are presented on the experimental evaluation of the instrumental
    corrections required by various imperfections in the measuring process for Istituto
    Elettrotecnico Nazionale electrically-calibrated absolute radiometers. Time constant,
    linearity, lead-heating effect and response variations across the surface have
    been evaluated using an ad-hoc algorithm implemented for measuring the low radiant
    powers involved in the measurements.</p>"
