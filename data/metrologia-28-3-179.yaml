  content: <p>The response behaviour of feedback-controlled radiometers has been analysed
    in order to understand how to design the control system and take measurements
    with the least measurement time for a given variance or vice versa. For "single-observation"
    measurements, in which the response is observed only once after settling for each
    shutter movement, solutions are obtained for the third-order system comprising
    integral plus proportional control and a first-order filter. Using expressions
    developed for the variance in the mean of a sequence of partially correlated observations,
    the analysis is extended to "repeated-observation" measurements which are averages
    of sequences of observations taken after settling for each shutter movement. Numerical
    analysis of one simple system shows that there is an optimal number of observations
    and control system design for any set of values of detector noise level, desired
    measurement variance, and sampling frequency.</p>
