  content: "<p>The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) scanning radiometers were
    used to measure the Earth's radiation fields during the period November 1984 through
    February 1990. The ERBE radiometric packages were placed into orbit aboard the
    Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 spacecraft platforms. In each radiometric package,
    thermistor bolometers were used as detection elements for the broadband total
    (0,2 - 50,0 μm), shortwave (0,2 - 5,0 μm), and longwave (5,0 - 50,0 μm) spectral
    regions. Flight calibration facilities were built into each of the spacecraft
    radiometric packages. The flight facilities consisted of black bodies, tungsten
    lamps, and silicon photodiodes. The black bodies and tungsten lamps were found
    to be reliable at precision levels approaching 0,5% over a five-year period. The
    photodiodes were found to degrade more than 2% during the first year in orbit.
    In this paper, the flight calibration systems for the ERBE scanning radiometers
    are described along with the resultant measurements.</p>"
