abstract:
- content: "<p>For detector calibration in the VUV spectral range, electrical substitution
    radiometers with low uncertainty for radiation powers between 10 nW and 1 Î¼W are
    being developed. The microbolometers utilize the low thermal capacitance of sapphire
    plates at the temperature of liquid helium. On the back side of the plate with
    an absorbing front surface a semiconductor resistor is used as thermometer and
    the calibration is achieved with an electrical heater. First measurements in the
    spectral range around 1 keV show satisfactory agreement with the results from
    a self-calibration technique of a Si photodiode.</p>"
