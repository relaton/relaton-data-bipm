  content: "<p>Results of numerical modelling of short-wavelength, internal quantum
    efficiency of two types of p<sup>+</sup> nn<sup>+</sup> silicon photodiode are
    presented. The important conclusions are: (1) interpreting the data obtained from
    oxide-bias experiments with the help of numerical quantum efficiency models will
    provide higher accuracy than can be obtained from the conventional self-calibration
    formula; (2) for high-quality silicon photodiodes, the spectral shape of the internal
    quantum deficiency (one minus the quantum efficiency) is virtually independent
    of the density of charge trapped in the oxide, and of the surface-recombination
    velocity at the oxide-silicon interface.</p>"
