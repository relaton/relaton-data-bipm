abstract:
- content: <p>The paper describes a new solid state detector which fulfils all the
    requirements of the ideal detector for optical radiation measurements. This "trap"
    detector is shown to be spatially uniform, linear, stable and to have a predictable
    relative spectral response so that it can be used to realize a relative spectral
    response scale with an uncertainty of less than 0,05%. The detector is also shown
    to be capable of disseminating an absolute spectral responsivity scale with an
    uncertainty of less than 0,02% at specific laser wavelengths and, independently,
    of realizing such a scale with an uncertainty of better than 0,05%.</p>
