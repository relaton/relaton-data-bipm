  content: "<p>In an earlier publication a silicon photodiode self-calibration boot-strap
    technique was demonstrated in a 633 nm laser power intercomparison with a cryogenic
    radiometer. The experiment involved individual silicon photodiodes whose quantum
    efficiency was determined at 633 nm from quantum efficiency measurements made
    at 442 nm. Although the results were quite good, there were some problems with
    that intercomparison that warranted further experimental work, the biggest problem
    being the instability of the reflectance of the silicon photodiodes. In this paper
    we report a second comparison of the boot-strap technique with a cryogenic radiometer
    where the reflectance stability problem has been solved by using three-detector
    light traps instead of individual silicon photodiodes. For five different trap
    detectors the average difference between the predicted absolute responsivity at
    633 nm and that measured by comparison to a cryogenic radiometer was 0,010% within
    a combined uncertainty of 0,025%.</p>"
