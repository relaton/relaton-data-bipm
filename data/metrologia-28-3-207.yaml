- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The inhomogeneity of responsivity of photodiodes limits the accuracy
    of their calibration. Inhomogeneity measurements of a Ge and InGaAs photodiode
    and of an integrating sphere equipped with an InGaAs photodiode are shown as examples.
    An evaluated set of inhomogeneity coefficients is proposed as a more advantageous
    and objective measure than original data matrices or their graphical presentation.
    The PTB facility for the calibration of transfer standards at the wavelength Î»
    = 1 047 nm is described. This takes inhomogeneity effects into account resulting
    in a relative transfer uncertainty of less than 10<sup>-4</sup>.</p>"
