abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a radiometric determination of the melting/freezing
    point of gold by measurement of the spectral radiance of a black body at that
    temperature. A simple optical system was used to image the black-body aperture
    onto a filter radiometer. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are
    discussed. The techniques to characterize the optical system are described together
    with the assessment of uncertainties. The freezing point of gold was found to
    be 1 337,330 K Â± 28 mK.</p>"
