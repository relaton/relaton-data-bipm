  content: "<p>The Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (ISAMS), to be flown
    on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), will make radiometric measurements
    of thermal emission by a number of atmospheric gases in the intermediate (4,6
    μm to 16,3 μm) infrared spectral region. In addition to relative spectral and
    field-of-view calibrations, an absolute radiometric determination of the integrated
    spectral throughput has been made using a system of two reference and one intermediate
    cryogenic black-body targets. The cold reference and intermediate targets were
    maintained at 77 K and the variable reference target could be controlled in small
    steps over the range 77 K to 320 K. Calculated emissivities of order ε = 0,9998
    could be realized for the large-aperture reference target with a structure of
    concentric V-grooves with diffusely emitting surfaces.</p>"
