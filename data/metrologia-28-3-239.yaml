abstract:
- content: "<p>A three-dimensional gonioradiometer for the measurement of spatial
    power distributions is described and methods optimizing spatial resolution and
    duration for the determination of total power (or related photometric quantities)
    are reported. A silicon photodiode with known spectral responsivity is used as
    detector (V(λ)-corrected for photometric measurements). The detector is moved
    by two frames mounted in a Cardanic gimbal suspension to give the instrument a
    radius of 0,3 m with a resolution of 0,01° for both polar angles in more than
    99% of the full solid angle. To ensure constant total radiant power of the luminescent
    diodes (LED) during the sequential measurements, their electrical power is stabilized
    using constant electrical current and additional temperature control. Results
    are given for some LEDs, which are calibrated as reference standards.</p>"
