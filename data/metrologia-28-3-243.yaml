abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper describes a method for determination of thermodynamic temperatures
    by measurement of the irradiance of a black body. Silicon pn-photodiodes, calibrated
    against a cryogenic radiometer, are used for the absolute irradiance measurements.
    This method enables the establishment of a radiometrically based high temperature
    scale, i.e. it requires no reference temperature. Stability tests of the cryogenic
    radiometer system and results of photodiode calibrations are presented. The uncertainties
    of the method are discussed with special emphasis on diffraction effects and on
    the spectral properties of the interference filters used for wavelength selection.</p>"
