abstract:
- content: "<p>Differential spectroradiometry is based on the determination and analysis
    of the differential spectral response of photoelectric devices in the presence
    of bias irradiance that can be varied with wavelength and over many orders of
    magnitude. The principle is described. Differential spectroradiometry is particularly
    suitable for the following applications that are reviewed or illustrated by some
    examples: determination of spectral and weighted responsivities allowing the transfer
    of the spectral responsivity scale to high levels of irradiance; determination
    of nonlinearities in the photocurrent-irradiance characteristic; non-destructive
    characterization of photoinduced effects.</p>"
