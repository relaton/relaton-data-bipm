  content: "<p>Concave spherical mirrors used off-axis to image monochromator exit
    or entrance slits to detectors or sources introduce significant astigmatism. This
    astigmatism can be completely eliminated by introducing a second concave mirror.
    Applications to spectroradiometric comparisons of sources and detectors are discussed.
    The use of supplementary slits to remove astigmatism is also discussed.</p>"
