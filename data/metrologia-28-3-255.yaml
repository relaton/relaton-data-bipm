abstract:
- content: "<p>Liquid-helium cooling of electrical substitution radiometers (ESRs)
    offers significant improvements in the time constant and sensitivity of these
    spectrally flat receivers. These cryogenic improvements have been used to good
    advantage in the design and prototype construction of fast ESR receivers (and
    receiver arrays) with sufficient sensitivity for NASA Earth remote-sensing applications.
    We describe some of our results in this area and suggest how the advantages offered
    by cryogenic ESRs might be useful in achieving the very long-term reproducibility
    that will be required in 21st-century pyrheliometry.</p>"
