abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to ensure that Earth Radiation Budget measurement from space
    continues through the 1990s, France, Germany and the USSR are developing a Scanning
    Radiometer for Radiation Balance (ScaRaB) to be flown on a series of METEOR-3
    Soviet polar orbiting weather satellites. The instrument described in this paper
    comprises two broad channels (0,2 μm to 50 μm, 0,2 μm to 4 μm) for radiation budget,
    and two narrower bands (0,5 μm to 0,7 μm, 10,5 μm to 12,5 μm) for scene identification,
    with spatial resolution at nadir of order 50 km. The set of on-board sources includes
    black-body simulators for the calibration of long-wave channels, and both tungsten
    filament lamps and mosaic array diffusers for short-wave calibration. A specific
    filtering scheme cancels the influence of thermal environment during calibration
    of the 0,2 μm to 50 μm channel on solar diffusers and lamps. Hemispherical choppers
    associated with pyroelectric detectors ensure a high immunity to low frequency
    noise and thermal transients.</p>"
