abstract:
- content: "<p>The Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and the NOAA-9 spacecraft
    solar monitors were used to measure the total solar irradiance during the period
    October 1984 to December 1989. Decreasing trends in the irradiance measurements
    were observed as sunspot activity decreased to minimum levels in 1986; after 1986,
    increasing trends were observed as sunspot activity increased. The magnitude of
    the irradiance variability was found to be approximately 0,1% between sunspot
    minimum and maximum (late 1989). When compared with the 1984 to 1989 indices of
    solar magnetic activity, the irradiance trends appear to be in phase with the
    11-year sunspot cycle. Both irradiance series yielded 1 365 Wm<sup>-2</sup> as
    the mean value of the solar irradiance, normalized to the mean Earth/Sun distance.
    The monitors are electrical substitution, active-cavity radiometers with estimated
    measurement precisions and accuracies of less than 0,02% and 0,2%, respectively.</p>"
