  content: "<p>A cavity radiometer of the H-F type was included as the total irradiance
    monitor of the Advanced Photovoltaic Experiment (APEX) aboard the Long Duration
    Exposure Facility (LDEF) satellite. This is the same type of cavity radiometer
    which has returned data from Nimbus-7 for almost twelve years. The LDEF was retrieved
    by the Space Shuttle Columbia on 12 January 1990 after almost six years in space.
    Initial results show that the electrical properties of the thermopile and heater
    circuits were unaffected. There was a slight visible change to the painted surface
    of the cavity, possibly caused by atomic oxygen impingement late in the mission.
    This apparently has not affected the agreement with ground-based reference standards.
    Intercomparisons to date indicate agreement of approximately 0,1%, but with an
    uncertainty at this same 0,1% level. The radiometer was included in the International
    Pyrheliometric Comparison (IPC VII) in September 1990. In-flight data was taken
    by an on-board data system (no telemetry) for the period from 7 April 1984 to
    16 March 1985. Digital flight data from which solar pointing and irradiance information
    can be calculated has recently become available.</p>"
