- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A group of precision pyrheliometers, designated PVS-7 and PVS-8, for
    use on the ground, in balloons and in spacecraft, has been constructed and a second-generation
    solar constant monitor, SCM-2, is under construction. The SCM-2 incorporates a
    precision solar pointing and tracking system with a pointing accuracy of 0,2°,
    a value well below the value of 0,5° which is shown to be the limit for precise
    pyrheliometry. With this type of equipment, high-altitude balloon SC measurements
    constitute a useful supplement to satellite measurements by providing an absolute
    link of sufficient accuracy to permit the evaluation of possible SC trends.</p>"
