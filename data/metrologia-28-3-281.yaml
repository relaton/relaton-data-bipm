- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Support is given for the suggestion that the mean annual value of the
    solar constant varies as an algebraic sum of changes in effective temperature
    and photospheric radius. A set of harmonic constituents covering the period 1979
    to 1987 is suggested. The fundamental harmonic used has a period of 10,56 years
    and harmonics of up to 74th order are described.</p>"
