abstract:
- content: "<p>A sunphotometer was used to measure the solar irradiance at three wavelengths
    from rockets and a balloon over a period of three years. The sunphotometer was
    developed at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD) and
    calibrated by an irradiance standard lamp. The measured solar irradiance agrees
    within + 1,5% and - 2,0% with Neckel and Labs measurements in the 1960s. Unfortunately,
    the measured variability cannot necessarily be assigned to solar origin because
    of insufficient calibration accuracy.</p>"
