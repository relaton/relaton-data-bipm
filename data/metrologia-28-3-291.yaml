abstract:
- content: <p>The use of self-scanning photodiode arrays is well established for low
    light intensity multi-spectral measurement systems such as those used in spectroscopy
    and astronomy. Using the newly developed EG&amp;G Reticon random access self-scanning
    linear photodiode array, an instrument has been developed for solar observations
    which overcomes the difficulties associated with these detectors at high light
    levels. By coupling this technology with flat-field concave holographic grating
    technology from American Holographic, a "sunphotospectrometer" has been built.
    This instrument is presently able to scan 1 024 channels of spectral information
    in less than 1 s. A prototype instrument is being tested with a second-generation
    version expected to fly aboard the US Space Shuttle within the next two years.
    The design of this instrument is described and preliminary spectra are presented
    to illustrate the measurement of NO<sub>2</sub> using this portable system.</p>
