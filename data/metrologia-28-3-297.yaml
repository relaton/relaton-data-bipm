abstract:
- content: "<p>The Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer satellite-borne ozone
    monitoring instrument and its radiometric calibration are described. BaSO<sub>4</sub>
    diffusers used as part of the calibration transfer optics were found to be unstable,
    losing up to 6.5% total reflectance at 230 nm over five years. The resulting calibration
    errors were corrected after the instrument was in orbit by using data gathered
    when a more stable aluminum diffuser was used. A small spectral irradiance disagreement
    between FEL and D2 lamps is described.</p>"
