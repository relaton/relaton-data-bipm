abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate calibration of remote-sensing instruments has become increasingly
    more important for studying long-term changes in our environment. Changes in atmospheric
    ozone are of great concern and have been observed from satellites for over a decade.
    Despite this record, long-term trends in ozone remain uncertain, primarily due
    to uncertainties in satellite instrument calibration after launch. In order to
    overcome this problem a Shuttle-borne Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) radiometer
    is being flown almost yearly in conjunction with the series of SBUV-type ozone
    sounders that are being flown on NASA research and NOAA operational satellites.
    The SSBUV calibration must be tracked to 1% or better to provide the requisite
    calibration transfer so that an ozone trend can be derived from the satellite
    data set. The first flight of the SSBUV occurred in October 1989. Calibration
    of the instrument was tracked before and after flight to a precision of 1% through
    laboratory calibrations, field calibration checks, and inflight calibration checks.
    As a result of the flight, the instrument experienced a 1% to 2% change in sensitivity
    in the wavelengths used for measuring ozone.</p>"
