- content: "<p>The Proceedings published in this special issue of  Metrologia are
    of New Developments and Applications in Optical Radiometry III, a meeting held
    in Davos, Switzerland, from 20–22 September 1990, organized by the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches
    Observatorium Davos (PMOD). As the title indicates it was the third in a series
    of such meetings: the first was organized by P V Foukal and took place in 1985
    at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., USA; the
    second was in 1988 at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK, organized
    by N P Fox and D H Nettleton. The idea of these meetings is to provide a platform
    to present and discuss developments and problem areas in optical radiometry among
    scientists working in different fields, such as metrology and solar radiometry.
    The choice of Davos as the meeting place was favoured by the fact that the 7th
    International Pyrheliometer Comparison (IPC VII) was held in autumn 1990 at PMOD.
    Although IPC is mainly technical and aimed at the worldwide standardization of
    pyrheliometers (radiometers used for solar measurements in meteorology), both
    communities—metrology and meteorology—have overlapping radiometric interests and
    a thorough exchange of ideas is important for the advancement of the field. The
    ever-increasing number of participants reveals the general interest in the topic
    and the next meeting, planned for spring 1992 in the United States, will be organized
    by B Guenther of the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md, USA.</p><p>The
    programme was divided into four sessions: Radiometric Scales, Radiometers and
    Quantum Detectors, Source Radiometry, and Solar Radiometry and Space Applications.
    A total of 47 papers were presented and most are published here. All contributions
    were refereed and cleared for publication by a board of four guest editors, one
    for each session: J L Gardner, L-P Boivin, D H Nettleton and B R Barkstrom. The
    pre-eminent value of the editors' work is manifested by the high quality and homogeneity
    of the papers.</p><p>The success of the meeting is due to the motivation and enthusiasm
    of all participants, the commitment of the members of the organizing committee
    and the fine work of the board of editors. All are gratefully acknowledged. Thanks
    are extended to the Swiss National Science Foundation for supporting some of the
    participants from Eastern countries.</p>"
