  content: "<p>The paper presents the experimental results of comparison between quantum
    voltages at two Josephson-junction devices made from niobium and YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7-δ</sub>
    high-temperature superconducting ceramics with the use of a SQUID galvanometer
    at 4,2 K. Voltage steps up to 290 μV at an irradiation frequency of 8,6 GHz have
    been investigated. It is found that the voltage step at ceramic junctions has
    zero slope and values of the constant <italic>K</italic><sub>J</sub> derived from
    the comparison of the two junctions are equal within a fractional measurement
    uncertainty 1 σ(<italic>K</italic><sub>J</sub>)/<italic>K</italic><sub>J</sub>
    of 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>.</p>"
