    <p>Within the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) the platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) is used to realize the scale from approximately 13,8 K to 1 235 K. Such a temperature range is wider than the corresponding range in the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68) because the PRT is used up to the freezing point of silver (1 234,93 K). In this way, the ITS-90 can be realized with much more precision than the IPTS-68, particularly between 901 K and 1 235 K where the standard Pt-10% Rh vs Pt thermocouple was previously used.</p>
    <p>This paper describes some important steps in the construction of the PRT reference function and the criteria for the selection of the PRT interpolating equations of the ITS-90. In contrast to previous international scales, the PRT range of the ITS-90 is based on two reference functions, one from 13,8 K to 273,16 K and the other from 273,15 K to 1 234,93 K. The two reference functions were obtained from two real PRTs.</p>
    <p>A set of interpolating equations is used to account for the differences of other real PRTs from those on which the reference functions are based. They provide flexibility of calibration and high precision as expressed, for instance, by non-uniqueness and sub-range inconsistency not exceeding 0,5 mK over the range from 13,8 K to 693 K. Such good properties are the consequence of the choice of suitable forms for the interpolating equations and of fine adjustments in the values assigned to some defining fixed points.</p>
