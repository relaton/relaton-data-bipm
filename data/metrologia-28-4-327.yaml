abstract:
- content: "<p>The historical path followed in the development of the reference function
    for interpolating temperatures from platinum resistance thermometers between 13,8033
    K and 273,16 K in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 is described. The
    construction of the reference function is discussed, as are the considerations
    which lead to the form adopted for the ITS-90.</p>"
