  content: "<p>The method and the devices used for absolute density measurements of
    mercury in the ASMW are described briefly. Measurements have been made recently
    on three mercury samples: these results are presented, discussed and compared
    with those obtained previously at the ASMW on two different samples and with the
    results of absolute density measurements carried out in other metrological institutes.</p>"
