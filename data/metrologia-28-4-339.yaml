abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been found that noble metal thermocouples can yield a thermoelectric
    temperature scale accurate within ± 0,1 °C from ambient to at least the silver
    point (962 °C) if they are calibrated after they have been heat treated into a
    reasonably stable thermoelectric state. However, the calibration is only valid
    for the particular section of the thermocouple wire that was calibrated. The use
    of any other, uncalibrated, sections of the thermocouple wire would render accurate
    calibration irrelevant.</p>"
