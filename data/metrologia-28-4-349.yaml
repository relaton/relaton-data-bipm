abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantum-efficient silicon photodetectors of VSL (The Netherlands) and
    SP (Sweden), were compared with the cryogenic absolute radiometer of VTT (Finland).
    Agreement between the detectors was found at a level of 10<sup>-4</sup> when the
    data of four silicon detectors are combined. The comparison was performed at a
    laser frequency of 5,515 81 × 10<sup>14</sup> Hz (λ = 543,515 nm in vacuum).</p>"
