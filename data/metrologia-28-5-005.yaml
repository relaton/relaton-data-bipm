abstract:
- content: "<p>The expression for B(T) recently proposed by Aziz and Slaman for<sup>4</sup>He
    allows a more precise and internally consistent analysis to be made of the dielectric
    constant data of Gugan and Michel, and this confirms that the new expression gives
    an excellent representation of the temperature dependent part of B(T) between
    4,2 K and 27,2 K. Improved expressions for the third- and fourth-density virial
    coefficients C(T) and D(T) have also been obtained.</p>"
