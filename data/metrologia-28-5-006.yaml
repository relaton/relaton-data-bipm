abstract:
- content: "<p>The freezing and melting behaviour of indium samples with nominal purities
    of 99,9999%, 99,999% and 99,99% has been studied to find the influence of conventional
    freezing techniques on the freezing temperature and to assess the effect of trace
    impurities on the quality of a fixed-point sample. Plateaus of constant temperature
    (± 0,1 mK) are readily obtained from both the induced and outside-chilled induced
    freezes, while freezing ranges of about 2 mK are observed in both the normal and
    outside-chilled freezes for all the samples. The maximum freezing temperatures
    of the conventional freezes are found to coincide very closely for each sample
    and to within ± 0,1 mK for the purest sample. The purest sample showed a narrow
    melting range on the melting curve after very fast freezing, in contrast to the
    other samples which showed the melting ranges expected of alloys. The average
    melting temperature of the purest sample closely agreed with the maximum freezing
    temperature. The difference between the average melting temperature after the
    very fast freeze and the maximum freezing temperature appears to be a useful criterion
    for assessing the quality of indium as a fixed-point sample.</p>"
