abstract:
- content: "<p>Narrow band filter radiometers have been used to measure the spectral
    radiance of black bodies held at the melting/freezing points of aluminium, silver
    and gold with an accuracy of 0,04%. Descriptions are given of the optical components
    and the techniques used for their characterization. As the measurements are absolute,
    the thermodynamic temperatures of these points can be calculated directly from
    the Planck radiation law. The values obtained are:</p><p>T (aluminium) = 933,509
    ± 0,027 K, \nT (silver) = 1 235,009 ± 0,044 K \nand T (gold) = 1 337,330 ± 0,049
    K.</p><p>These values are analysed with reference to the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) and to the data that were used to derive the scale. The
    conclusion drawn is that, while the ITS-90 has a sounder thermodynamic basis than
    its predecessor (IPTS-68), the temperature intervals between the high temperature
    fixed points, which were thought to be well established, may need further investigation.</p>"
