abstract:
- content: "<p>In considering the second virial coefficient corrections for low temperature
    helium gas thermometry, the ITS-90 has incorporated data fits for the<sup>4</sup>He
    and<sup>3</sup>He second virial coefficients. An alternative is to use second
    virial coefficients calculated from recent interatomic potential functions for
    helium. We compare several functions using different computer codes to assess
    the accuracy of the calculations. The most recent function is the HFD-B2 of Aziz
    and Slaman. In the literature it is found that the potentials developed by different
    authors using their respective codes indicate a spread of only 0,4 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol
    at the lowest experimental temperature (2,6 K) for<sup>4</sup>He. When calculations
    based on these same potentials are performed with the same code, the spread is
    nearly twice as large. However, calculations based on the two codes which have
    undergone recent improvements produce a spread of less than 0,01 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol
    when based on the same potential. For<sup>3</sup>He, there is a relative difference
    between potential functions of 0,4 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol down to the lowest temperature
    of 1,5 K. There is a larger systematic difference between the calculations and
    the data fit which indicates that there is a contribution from the third virial
    in the latest<sup>3</sup>He second virial coefficient data.</p>"
