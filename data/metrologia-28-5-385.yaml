  content: "<p>A least-squares estimation of the difference between the previous as-maintained
    electrical units, based on artifacts, and the new electrical units, maintained
    using the quantum Hall effect, is discussed. A linear fit of the Î©<sub>69-BI</sub>
    drift is considered in order to combine the direct and indirect estimates. The
    statistical correlations of the input data are discussed and consequential reformulations
    of the algorithms used for evaluating input data are given.</p>"
