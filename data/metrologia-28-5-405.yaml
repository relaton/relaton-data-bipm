  content: "<p>The expression for <italic>B</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) recently
    proposed by Aziz and Slaman for <sup>4</sup>He allows a more precise and internally
    consistent analysis to be made of the dielectric constant data of Gugan and Michel,
    and this confirms that the new expression gives an excellent representation of
    the temperature dependent part of <italic>B</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) between
    4,2 K and 27,2 K. Improved expressions for the third- and fourth-density virial
    coefficients <italic>C</italic>(<italic>T</italic>) and <italic>D</italic>(<italic>T</italic>)
    have also been obtained.</p>"
