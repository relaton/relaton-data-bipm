  content: "<p>An international comparison in the pressure range 20 MPa to 100 MPa
    has been carried out under the auspices of the high-pressure working group of
    the Comité Consultatif pour la Masse et les grandeurs apparentées (CCM). The work
    was initiated in 1981 and completed in 1989. The standards laboratories of seventeen
    countries participated in the comparison. The results of the laboratories which
    took part in the first three phases have been published in a comparative form
    in <italic>Metrologia</italic>. This paper presents the complete results and the
    main conclusions of the work.</p>"
