abstract:
- content: "<p>This letter describes a device, termed a coupled-microphone simulator,
    for verifying equipment used in the calibration of microphones by the reciprocity
    technique. The device is a useful tool in the intercomparison of national standards
    of sound pressure and for auditing laboratories within a national measurement
    system.</p>"
