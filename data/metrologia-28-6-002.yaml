abstract:
- content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) is engaged in a range
    of projects which call for dimensional precision of order 1 nm. These include
    research and development (i) to improve linear and angular displacement metrology;
    (ii) to investigate the physical interaction of high resolution probes with technical
    surfaces and microstructures and so to represent the microtopography, form and
    dimension of measures. The limits vary with application and technology. Currently,
    only one-dimensional displacement measurements and microtopography provide the
    level of accuracy for which figures in the sub-nanometre range can be given. For
    the measurement of form and dimension of volumetric standards, barriers have still
    to be recognized around 10 nm. The application of single-crystal silicon devices
    for different length and angle measurements with nanometre and nanorad accuracy
    is of particular interest for the PTB.</p>"
