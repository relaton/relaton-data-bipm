  content: "<p>In the Yoshida Nano-Mechanism Project, two types of nanometrology have
    been studied: microtopography measurement with the scanning tunnelling microscope
    (STM) and distance measurement with the laser interferometer. Using the STM, graphite
    surfaces and biological samples were examined and a modification of the STM instrumentation,
    the capacitor insertion method, usefully improved performance. A unique two-wavelength
    method has been studied to eliminate air-turbulence-induced errors in the laser
    interferometer. Measurement technology is closely related to control technology
    through the need for feedback position sensors. Control technology, in turn, creates
    new possibilities for measurement technology. Position control to one nanometre
    has now been achieved.</p>"
