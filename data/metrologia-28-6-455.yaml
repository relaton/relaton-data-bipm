  content: "<p>The measurement of nanometre displacements with picometre resolution
    has been made possible by a phase-modulation recovery scheme applied to an optical
    Michelson interferometer using polarization encoding. In contrast to conventional
    schemes, phase modulation is carried out before the interferometer optics. In
    this way, the low-frequency components of the phase shift between the two interfering
    beams are locked at zero (within limits set only by shot noise) before beam splitting
    by a feedback loop driving the modulator. An interferometer prototype, illuminated
    by a beam thus modulated, was constructed and coupled to an X-ray interferometer
    to compare the optical and X-ray interferometric measurement values of sub-nanometre
    displacements. A resolution better than 1 pm over a 100 Hz bandwidth was obtained.</p>"
