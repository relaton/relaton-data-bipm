abstract:
- content: "<p>An ultra micro-indentation system for investigating the elastic and
    plastic properties of surface coatings and near-surface materials is described.
    The instrument produces minute indentations by the application of loads to geometrically
    accurate pointed or spherical diamond indenters. Material properties are derived
    from records of the load and depth of penetration. Depth of penetration is measured
    with a resolution less than 1 nm. The force at initial contact can be substantially
    less than 0,1 mN. The instrument has a wide range of research and quality control
    applications which include the determination of the depth distribution of hardness
    and elastic modulus of hard and soft materials â€“ TiN, gold and polymer films and
    coatings, for example. It also has applications in the determination of the workhardening
    index, in fracture mechanics and in exploring the material properties of small
    areas of individual phases in polyphased materials.</p>"
