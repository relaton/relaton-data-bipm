abstract:
- content: "<p>A theoretical framework for mapping the performance of measuring instruments
    has been developed that is used to interpret the results of measurements at the
    nanometric level, where it is particularly important to understand the geometrical
    and physical interactions between the measuring instrument and the object being
    measured. Nanometric topographic measuring instruments that have been developed
    at the NPL span measuring ranges of 0,01 nm to 3 nm in surface amplitude and 0,3
    nm to 100 nm in surface wavelength.</p>"
