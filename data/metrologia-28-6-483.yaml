  content: "<p>Precision measurements at the National Research Laboratory of Metrology
    used to determine fundamental constants and to test physical theory are described:
    they are related to the determination of silicon lattice spacing; the magnetic
    flux quantum; and a search for the fifth force. Equipment and techniques for nanometrology
    are described in terms of the nanoscale, nanoguide and nanodrive, all of which
    have immediate applications in advanced technology. An example is introduced which
    demonstrates the power of the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) in nanometrology.</p>"
