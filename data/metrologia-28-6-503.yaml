abstract:
- content: "<p>Procedures for precision polishing and testing spheres of silicon and
    silica are described. Hand-polishing procedures result in the production of spheres
    of 90 mm diameter with deviations from roundness of less than 50 nm. The roundness
    was measured to an uncertainty of 5 nm on a Talyrond with averaging procedures
    to account for spindle errors.</p>"
