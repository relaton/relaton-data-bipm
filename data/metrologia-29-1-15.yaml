abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparison calibration designs are rank insufficient to permit a purely
    batch estimation of parameters, and require the input of some a priori knowledge.
    The estimator commonly used, which is based on Restrained Least Squares, is shown
    to be inappropriate because of its inability to take account of uncertainty in
    the a priori knowledge. A model in which the parameters represent the state of
    a dynamic stochastic system is proposed together with the appropriate recursive
    estimator, namely the Kalman filter-predictor. This estimator is less affected
    than Restrained Least Squares by errors in the a priori knowledge. Its application
    in mass comparisons in conjunction with a fully recursive approach, i.e. with
    use of all the available a priori knowledge, is discussed.</p>"
