abstract:
- content: "<p>Theoretical analyses of the effects of quantization, differential and
    integral non-linearities on digital correlators measuring noise power are reviewed.
    The theoretical results are then applied to the measurement and modelling of errors
    in two 15-bit analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs) used in a high-accuracy Johnson
    noise thermometer. The experimental results support the theory and show that a
    significant fraction of the correlator error can be modelled by an error in the
    sign bit of the ADCs. This error cannot be modelled by a truncated Taylor series.
    For the ADCs tested, the model fits the observed non-linearities with an accuracy
    of 10 ppm relative to the noise variance.</p>"
