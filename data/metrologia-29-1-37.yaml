abstract:
- content: "<p>The second and third dielectric virial coefficients of<sup>4</sup>He
    have been measured by the symmetrical gas-expansion technique of Buckingham, Cole
    and Sutter for six isotherms between 3,00 K and 17,68 K. The effects of helium
    adsorption are important, and are considered in detail. No temperature dependence
    of the second coefficient is seen at a level of δb=±0,008 cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>,
    and average values of the second and third coefficients are b = 0,006 (10) cm<sup>3</sup>
    mol<sup>-1</sup> and c = -5 (4) cm<sup>6</sup> mol<sup>-2</sup>, respectively.
    The uncertainty for b is relatively large because it has a systematic dependence
    on c: reanalysis of all the existing data shows that a more probable value of
    the third coefficient is c = -2 (1) cm<sup>6</sup> mol<sup>-2</sup>, which when
    combined with our data gives b (3 K - 18 K) = -0,001 (4) cm<sup>-3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>.
    The very small value suggests that theoretical calculations of the excess polarizability
    of the helium diatom need to be reconsidered. The small value and the small uncertainty
    of b indicate that future work to improve experimental values of the second density
    virial coefficient of<sup>4</sup>He for this temperature range may without ambiguity
    make use of the methods of dielectric constant gas thermometry.</p>"
