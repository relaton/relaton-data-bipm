  content: "<p>The second and third dielectric virial coefficients of <sup>4</sup>He
    have been measured by the symmetrical gas-expansion technique of Buckingham, Cole
    and Sutter for six isotherms between 3,00 K and 17,68 K. The effects of helium
    adsorption are important, and are considered in detail. No temperature dependence
    of the second coefficient is seen at a level of δ<italic>b</italic>=±0,008 cm<sup>3</sup>
    mol<sup>-1</sup>, and average values of the second and third coefficients are
    <italic>b</italic> = 0,006 (10) cm<sup>3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>c</italic>
    = -5 (4) cm<sup>6</sup> mol<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. The uncertainty for <italic>b</italic>
    is relatively large because it has a systematic dependence on <italic>c</italic>:
    reanalysis of all the existing data shows that a more probable value of the third
    coefficient is <italic>c</italic> = -2 (1) cm<sup>6</sup> mol<sup>-2</sup>, which
    when combined with our data gives <italic>b</italic> (3 K - 18 K) = -0,001 (4)
    cm<sup>-3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>. The very small value suggests that theoretical
    calculations of the excess polarizability of the helium diatom need to be reconsidered.
    The small value and the small uncertainty of <italic>b</italic> indicate that
    future work to improve experimental values of the second <italic>density</italic>
    virial coefficient of <sup>4</sup>He for this temperature range may without ambiguity
    make use of the methods of dielectric constant gas thermometry.</p>"
