  content: "<p>The experimental procedure described here in detail enables the heat
    defect of water caused by electron radiation in the energy range from 1 MeV to
    5 MeV to be determined with an overall uncertainty of less than 0,5% for the correction
    factor. The principle of measurement is based on a comparison of the temperature
    increase caused by the radiation energy of electrons totally absorbed in water
    with that caused by an ohmic heating of the water. In measuring the radiant energy
    of the electrons, corrections are needed for backscatter of the electrons entering
    the water and for bremsstrahlung energy loss during electron slowing down. Precise
    knowledge of the heat defect is a prerequisite for the establishment of the water
    absorbed-dose calorimeter as a primary standard of absorbed dose to water.</p>"
