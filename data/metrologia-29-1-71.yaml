abstract:
- content: "<p>Design considerations for the NRC sealed cryogenic triple point cells
    are discussed, together with their filling system. The versatility of the filling
    system is illustrated by the purification of CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, it is shown
    that the effects of residual impurities upon the realized liquidus points of high-purity
    cryogenic substances may be demonstrated by observing the dependence of the liquidus
    points on the fraction of sample condensed.</p>"
