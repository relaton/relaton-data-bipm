  content: "<p>An algorithm of the Monte Carlo method is described which allows evaluation
    of the effective emissivities of isothermal and nonisothermal specular-diffuse
    black-body cavities for use in radiometry, photometry and optical pyrometry. The
    calculation provides estimates of normal spectral effective emissivity for black-body
    cavities, formed by cone surfaces and a cylinder. It does this for an isothermal
    cavity and for a cavity having an arbitrary variation of temperature along the
    cavity length.</p>"
