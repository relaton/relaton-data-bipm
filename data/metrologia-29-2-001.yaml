abstract:
- content: "<p>Techniques related to the establishment and the comparison of primary
    standards of resistance and capacitance are described and discussed. In the field
    of resistance, the characteristics of primary standard resistors of 1 Ω and 10
    000 Ω are presented and dc resistance-ratio measurement techniques reviewed, including
    the series-parallel method, the Warshawsky bridge and the cryogenic current comparator
    bridge. A review of techniques and results regarding very low-frequency ac measurements
    of dc standard resistors is also given. In the field of capacitance, the realization
    of the farad using calculable standards is discussed as well as the techniques
    for accurate measurements of four terminal-pair impedances used in particular
    for linking the farad and the ohm.</p>"
