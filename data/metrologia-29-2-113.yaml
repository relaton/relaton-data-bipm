  content: "<p>The second is the only unit of the SI system which is defined in terms
    of an internal property of an atom. The definition is realized using a thermal
    beam of caesium atoms. In classical caesium beam frequency standards, the necessary
    state selection is accomplished by deflecting atoms in magnet state selectors.
    In devices under development, this state selection is performed through atom-light
    interaction. The physical bases underlying the caesium beam frequency standards
    are given. The main design characteristics of caesium beam tubes are described.
    The limitations to the properties of metrological interest, frequency stability
    and accuracy are analysed. In particular, the principal sources of frequency offsets
    are described. The potentialities of classical and of optically pumped caesium
    beam frequency standards are compared. Manufactured devices designed for field
    use are considered as well as laboratory primary frequency and time standards.</p>"
