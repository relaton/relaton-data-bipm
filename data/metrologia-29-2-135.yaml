- language: en

  content: "<p>This paper summarizes the principles, historical background and present
    status of three primary areas of rf and microwave measurements and standards:
    circuit parameter measurement, power measurement, and noise generation and measurement.
    Both the reference standards and the techniques of measurement and of transfer
    to secondary standards are addressed. An extensive bibliography is provided to
    enable the interested reader to pursue areas to greater depth, and brief discussions
    to indicate likely directions of current and future work are included.</p>"
