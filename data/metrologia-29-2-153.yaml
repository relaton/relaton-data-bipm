abstract:
- content: "<p>Josephson voltage standards with series arrays of up to 20 000 tunnel
    junctions can generate stable reference voltages at arbitrary values between -
    15 V and + 15 V. These standards, which are now installed in many national and
    industrial laboratories, are used to calibrate Weston cells or Zener reference
    standards, to measure the linearity of digital voltmeters, and as precise potentiometers
    for the measurement of voltage and resistance ratios. The fundamental principles,
    the historical development, the design, the fabrication and the operation of these
    voltage standards are reviewed.</p>"
