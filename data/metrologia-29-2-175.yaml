  content: "<p>Following the discovery of the quantum Hall effect in 1980 metrologists
    were eager to develop the effect as a resistance standard in a similar manner
    to the development, a decade earlier, of the Josephson effects in superconductors
    as a voltage standard. This article reviews the progress made by many national
    laboratories to assess and compare the quality and limitations of semiconductor
    devices, mainly silicon MOSFETs and GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, as quantized
    Hall resistance standards with values <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub> (<italic>i</italic>)
    = <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>/<italic>i</italic> = <italic>h/ie</italic><sup>2</sup>,
    where <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub> = 25812,807 Ω is the von Klitzing constant
    and <italic>i</italic> is an integer. Potentiometric and cryogenic current comparator
    bridge techniques for the measurement of <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub> in terms
    of conventional resistance standards with 1 σ relative accuracies better than
    1 part in 10<sup>8</sup> are compared, and determinations of <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>
    in ohms with accuracies as high as 2,4 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> using calculable
    capacitors are described. The comparison of direct determinations of <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>
    with alternative derivations of <italic>h/e</italic><sup>2</sup> leading to the
    CCE recommendations and subsequent international adoption, from 1 January 1990,
    of the value 25812,807 ± 0,005 Ω for <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub> are also described.</p>"
