abstract:
- content: "<p>Following the discovery of the quantum Hall effect in 1980 metrologists
    were eager to develop the effect as a resistance standard in a similar manner
    to the development, a decade earlier, of the Josephson effects in superconductors
    as a voltage standard. This article reviews the progress made by many national
    laboratories to assess and compare the quality and limitations of semiconductor
    devices, mainly silicon MOSFETs and GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, as quantized
    Hall resistance standards with values R<sub>H</sub> (i) = R<sub>K</sub>/i = h/ie<sup>2</sup>,
    where R<sub>K</sub> = 25812,807 Ω is the von Klitzing constant and i is an integer.
    Potentiometric and cryogenic current comparator bridge techniques for the measurement
    of R<sub>K</sub> in terms of conventional resistance standards with 1 σ relative
    accuracies better than 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup> are compared, and determinations
    of R<sub>K</sub> in ohms with accuracies as high as 2,4 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>
    using calculable capacitors are described. The comparison of direct determinations
    of R<sub>K</sub> with alternative derivations of h/e<sup>2</sup> leading to the
    CCE recommendations and subsequent international adoption, from 1 January 1990,
    of the value 25812,807 ± 0,005 Ω for R<sub>K</sub> are also described.</p>"
