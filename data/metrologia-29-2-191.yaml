  content: "<p>Ac-dc transfer standards provide an essential link for the determination
    of ac electric quantities in terms of the SI units. Thermal converters are by
    far the most widely used form of primary ac-dc transfer standards. The basic principles
    of ac-dc transfer measurements are presented together with background to the performance
    and basic limitations of thermal converters as transfer standards. Developments
    in basic converters, voltage transfer standards and current transfer standards
    are reviewed, with emphasis on developments since 1985. Current activities and
    possible future directions are discussed.</p>"
