  content: "<p>The paper discusses the recent measurements of the fundamental physical
    constants whose various combinations serve to provide the natural units of measurement
    in physics and the evaluation of their recommended values by the CODATA Task Group
    on Fundamental Constants. It emphasizes the strong involvement of the SI units
    with the present evaluations and shows how the fundamental physical constants
    play an increasing role in defining and maintaining many of the SI units of today
    and in sustaining the integrity of our measurement system. The present situation
    is reviewed and the evolving role of the fundamental physical constants in science
    and technology is discussed.</p>"
