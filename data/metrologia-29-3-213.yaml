  content: <p>The precise measurement of weak effects plays a pivotal role in metrology
    and in the determination of the fundamental constants. Hence, the possibility
    of new weak forces, and the related question of non-Newtonian behaviour of the
    gravitational force, have been of special interest to both measurement scientists
    and those involved in precise tests of physical laws. To date there is no compelling
    evidence for any deviations from the predictions of Newtonian gravity in the nonrelativistic
    weak-field regime. A significant literature on this question has developed over
    the past few years, and a host of experiments and theoretical scenarios have been
    discussed. Moreover, a very close relationship exists between the experimental
    methodologies used to determine the absolute value of the Newtonian gravitational
    constant <italic>G</italic>, and those employed in searches for new weak forces
    and for breakdowns in the inverse-square law of gravity. We have therefore prepared
    a new index of measurements of such effects, using the original bibliographic
    work of Gillies as a starting point, but also including citations to the appropriate
    theoretical papers in the field. The focus of the present version of the index
    is then studies of the "fifth force", measurements of gravitational effects on
    antimatter, searches for a spin-component in the gravitational force, and related
    phenomena.</p>
