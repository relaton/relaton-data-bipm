abstract:
- content: '<p>The spectral emissivities of refractory transition metals have been
    measured from about 2 500 K up to temperatures above the melting point T<sub>m</sub>.
    The experimental method adopted is based on multiwavelength pyrometric measurements,
    where the determination of the spectral emissivity is implicitly related to the
    evaluation of temperature through the radiation emission law and an assumed relationship
    between the spectral emissivity ε and the wavelength λ. Heating was produced with
    a pulsed laser in times of order 100 ms. A specially constructed pyrometer was
    used which enabled measurements at six different wavelengths to be carried out
    at time intervals of order 0,1 ms. A model for the evaluation of temperature and
    spectral emissivities has been developed and its limitations arising from statistical
    and systematic errors are discussed. Our experiments on the refractory transition
    metals Hf, Mo, Nb, Re, Rh, Ta, W, V and Zr: (i) confirm the existence of a unique
    wavelength, λ<sub>x</sub>, for each metal (already well established in the solid
    state where ∂ε<sub>λ</sub>/∂λ ⩽ 0) to which different ε<sub>λ</sub>-isotherms
    converge for λ &lt; λ<sub>x</sub>, from which they diverge for λ&gt;λ<sub>x</sub>
    and at which ε<sub>λ</sub> is independent of T, and thus equal, in particular,
    to its value at T<sub>m</sub>; (ii) indicate that λ<sub>x</sub> is preserved through
    T<sub>m</sub>; and (iii) reveal that at T<sub>m</sub> these metals are effectively
    "grey", i.e. their emissivity, within the measurement uncertainty, is independent
    of λ (∂ε<sub>λ</sub>/∂λ = 0), while for T &gt; T<sub>m</sub> is ∂ε<sub>λ</sub>/∂λ
    &gt; 0, that is, opposite to its behaviour at T&lt;T<sub>m</sub>.</p>'
