  content: "<p>In order to evaluate the agreement among representations of the ohm
    based on the quantum Hall effect and to establish a firm basis for international
    traceability among the laboratories concerned, the BIPM, at the request of the
    CCE, organized and carried out an international comparison of 1 Ω and 10 kΩ resistance
    standards from eighteen national laboratories and from the BIPM. The weighted
    means of the results obtained by the ten national laboratories which, like the
    BIPM, based their measurements on their own QHE resistance standard differ from
    the BIPM results by (-0,032±0,024) parts in 10<sup>6</sup> at the 1 Ω level and
    by (0,009±0,022) parts in 10<sup>6</sup> at the 10 kΩ level.</p>"
