  content: <p>An analytic approach, based on thin-wall theory, to analysis of the
    "controlled clearance" method of restricting the gap between a shaft and a surrounding
    cylinder is presented. A modified form of thin-wall theory allows this analysis
    to be extended to seals with outside to inside diameter ratios up to 2.3. The
    effects of (a) the supply pressure, the jacket pressure, the pressure dependence
    of the viscosity of the oil and the geometry of the system on (b) the deformation
    of the cylinder, the pressure profile in the gap between the shaft and the cylinder
    and the flow of oil are illustrated. A path using this information is given for
    the design of a controlled clearance seal. It is shown that when the jacket pressure
    and the supply pressure are equal (reentrant cylinder condition) the supply pressure
    needed to close the gap is infinite. The difference between this result and that
    for a cylinder with a built-in end, for which the supply pressure for closure
    is finite, is discussed. Experimental tests are described and the results are
    shown to agree with computed figures based on the theory. This work is of particular
    relevance to hydraulically actuated standards of pressure and force, where "simple"
    piston-cylinder assemblies suffer excessive deformations at pressures beyond 50
    MPa.</p>
