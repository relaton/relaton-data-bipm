  content: "<p>An international neutron-dosimetry comparison has been organized by
    the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures by circulating a set of transfer
    instruments supplied by the BIPM. Eight laboratories participated in this comparison.
    Its purpose was to compare, free in air, the kerma values in A-150 plastic for
    the neutron and gamma components, <italic>K</italic><sub>N</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>G</sub>,
    per unit of reference monitor in the local (d + T) mixed (n + γ) field, when measured
    with the BIPM equipment and with the local dosimetry systems. The results of the
    comparison are given and discussed.</p>"
