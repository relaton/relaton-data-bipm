abstract:
- content: "<p>Soviet and Australian photometric and radiometric standards have been
    intercompared. Luminous intensity and luminous flux values were compared using
    lamps, and illuminance, irradiance and spectral responsivity using detectors.
    Agreement at the 1% level or better was found for these values as determined by
    the two national laboratories.</p>"
