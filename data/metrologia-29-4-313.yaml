abstract:
- content: <p>A new way to realize the ampere by the method of superconducting mass
    levitation is proposed. The approach promises to simplify the measurement procedure
    because it substitutes the "mechnical" joule realization by measurements in the
    levitation mode of the periods of small vertical oscillations of the mass. One
    has to measure the period value, with constant current flowing in the levitating
    coil, and again with the mass in the same position but with the coil short-circuited
    to maintain the magnetic flux constant.</p>
