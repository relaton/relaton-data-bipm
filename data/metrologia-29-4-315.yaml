  content: "<p>The Edlén equation has become the standard method of relating the index
    of refraction of air to the air temperature, pressure and humidity. The recent
    suggestion for improvements in the humidity dependence by Birch and Downs has
    been verified at the 0,633 μm He-Ne laser wavelength using the line scale interferometer
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>"
