- content: "<p>The seminar will be held from 2 to 4 June 1993, preceding the next
    meeting of the CCM, at the Laboratoire National d'Essais (LNE), 1 rue Gaston Boissier,
    75015 Paris, France.</p><p>Scope of the Seminar</p><p>The purpose of the seminar
    is to review the state of the art of pressure measurements in the 1 kPa to 1 GPa
    range and to present original and innovative contributions from standards laboratories
    and industry.</p><p>Main Topics</p><p>The seminar will be organized in six sessions
    as follows:<p>Liquid-column manometers</p><p>Piston gauge pressure standards</p><p>Properties
    of liquids and gases relevant to pressure metrology</p><p>Pressure transducers
    and transfer standards</p><p>Pressure standard comparison (methods and results)</p><p>Dynamic
    pressure measurements.</p></p><p>Each topic will be introduced by a review paper
    presented by a session chairman. A final session, coordinated by Dr G F Molinar
    (IMGC), Chairman of the CCM High Pressure Working Group, and Dr P Stuart (NPL),
    Chairman of the CCM Medium Pressure Working Group, will deal with:<p>Actual limits
    of accuracy of static pressure measurements in fluid media</p><p>Fundamental problems
    in pressure metrology between I kPa and 1 GPa.</p></p><p>Call for Papers</p><p>Papers
    should be prepared for oral presentation and will be refereed by the session chairmen.
    The Proceedings will be published as a special issue of Metrologia. Papers should
    be written according to the instructions for authors printed on the inside back
    cover of this journal. A one-page abstract should be sent to\nDr Molinar at the
    IMGC, to arrive before 31 January 1993.</p><p>A participation fee of 900 FFr (175
    US$) will be charged. This will cover general expenses and a copy of the Proceedings.
    Hotel reservations, meals and transport are not included.</p><p>Organizers</p><p>For
