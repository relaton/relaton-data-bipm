abstract:
- content: "<p>The correlation-induced spectral shifts recently introduced by Wolf
    are analysed in the context of generalized radiometry. It is found, given an incoherent
    source of radiation and an optical system consisting of a series of thin apertures
    and lenses, that the only physical effect that can induce spectral changes is
    diffraction. Previous workers have shown that diffraction effects are too small
    to be a significant source of error in spectral irradiance calibrations.</p>"
