abstract:
- content: "<p>Results of an international comparison of iodine absorption cells organized
    by the BIPM are reported. Ten of the thirteen member laboratories of the Comité
    Consultatif pour la Définition du Mètre (CCDM) participated. Two experimental
    methods were used to estimate the purity of the iodine in the cells: first, the
    cells were incorporated in BIPM He-Ne lasers and the laser frequencies thus obtained
    at λ = 633 nm were compared by the beat frequency method with those of the BIPM
    reference lasers and, second, direct measurements of iodine purity by a laser-induced
    fluorescence method were made at λ = 502 nm. Of the thirty-nine cells investigated,
    more than half are pure enough to realize a frequency reproducibility to within
    10 kHz (2 parts in 10<sup>11</sup> in relative terms). A contamination of<sup>129</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    has been observed in certain cells containing<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>. The
    comparison confirms that observed frequency shifts of the hyperfine components
    in iodine are strongly linked to impurities in the iodine cells.</p>"
