  content: "<p>A method for estimation of the uncertainties caused by elastic deformations
    in a superconducting levitation electromechanical system is proposed. For the
    VNIIM system, with a monolithic supporting coil, these uncertainties are estimated
    to be 1 to 3 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>"
