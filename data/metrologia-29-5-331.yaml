abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> He-Ne stabilized
    lasers, used as length standards, has been made. Five laboratories from Sweden,
    Denmark (two laboratories), Finland and Germany were represented. In addition,
    two lasers from the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures took part in order
    to relate the results to earlier comparisons. The reproducibility of the frequency
    mean of the four components d, e, f and g in the transition R(127)11-5 in iodine
    127 for the different lasers was found to be 15 kHz, taken as the standard deviation
    of the distribution of frequency among the group of ten lasers. Using laser BIPM4
    as reference the frequency average of the group of lasers was +3,6 kHz, making
    this a good reference laser for the current ensemble. Measurements of frequency
    dependence on modulation amplitude, iodine pressure and, for some lasers, intracavity
    power are reported. The relative frequency partition of the four components d,
    e, f and g of each laser was also determined and shown to exhibit characteristics
    which are new for this type of stabilized laser.</p>"
