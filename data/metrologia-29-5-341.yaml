  content: "<p>The realization of the unit gray of the quantity absorbed dose to water
    by means of a water calorimeter requires knowledge of the heat defect to water,
    which is defined as the fraction of the radiation energy absorbed not appearing
    as heat. For low energy X-rays the heat defect can be determined by a method which
    uses total absorption of soft X-rays without involving absorbed dose measurements.
    The method described takes advantage of relative measurements allowing equal amounts
    of radiation energy to be absorbed in water or in a metal without heat defect.
    The method is outlined, the experimental set-up is described and the necessary
    corrections are discussed. Within the limits of uncertainty it is found that the
    pure water used in this study does not exhibit a heat defect.</p>"
