  content: "<p>The calibration of long gauge blocks of up to 1 m using the vacuum
    wavelength comparator according to Kösters, and three laser wavelength standards
    recommended by the CIPM, is described. The relative uncertainty of this calibration
    is shown to be as low as 1,3 × 10<sup>-8</sup> for suitable gauge blocks of 1
    m length. In addition, a discontinuity of the length calibration of 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup>
    was introduced when the international temperature scales were changed.</p>"
