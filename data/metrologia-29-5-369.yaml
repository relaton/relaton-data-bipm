abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of half-inch microphone calibrations for pressure
    sensitivity level was organized and carried out as a EUROMET project between four
    national acoustics laboratories (Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland)
    and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK) as pilot laboratory. The aim was
    to test for consistency between different realizations of the standard of sound
    pressure through the calibration of standard half-inch microphones in the frequency
    range from 0,125 kHz to 25 kHz. The average of the results obtained by the participants
    differs from the NPL results by &lt; 0,02 dB in the frequency range from 0,125
    kHz to 5 kHz and by 0,03 dB to 0,10 dB from 6 kHz to 25 kHz. These differences
    are small compared to the estimated uncertainties.</p>"
