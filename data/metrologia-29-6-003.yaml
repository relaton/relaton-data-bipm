abstract:
- content: "<p>The one volt standards of the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL), Tsukuba,
    Japan, and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), Sèvres, France,
    were compared by three methods: direct comparison of the outputs of Josephson
    junction arrays; indirect comparison via a voltage transfer standard; and simple
    comparison of standards based on Zener diodes calibrated with the array instruments.
    The first two methods show no difference between the two array standards to within
    a type A uncertainty of 1,5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> (0,15 nV). The combined uncertainty
    for the first two methods is 0,2 nV. For the Zener diode measurements the ETL
    value was 2 nV higher than that of the BIPM when the Zener diode device's output
    was grounded and 16 nV lower when it was floating.</p>"
