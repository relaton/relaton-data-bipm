  content: "<p>An analysis of the propagation of the variance of temperature and barometric
    pressure in the determination of relative humidity by means of dew point gauges
    and psychrometers is presented. The results are applicable in the temperature
    range 273 K to 300 K and to barometric pressures between about 60 kPa and 115
    kPa.</p>"
