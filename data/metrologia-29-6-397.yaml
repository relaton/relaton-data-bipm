  content: "<p>The Global Positioning System is an outstanding tool for the dissemination
    of time. Equipped with C/A-code GPS time receivers, civil users may access the
    time scale GPS time, which is disseminated by the GPS satellites, and then the
    reference time scales UTC(USNO) and UTC. At a given instant, the restitution of
    GPS time through the satellite constellation presents a peak-to-peak discrepancy
    of several tens of nanoseconds without SA and several hundreds of nanoseconds
    with SA. The application of a Kalman filter to GPS timing data allows local access
    to GPS time through an estimation based on past data and updated at each new observation.
    The real-time restitution of GPS time, with implementation of SA, is then improved
    to the level obtained without SA. This paper gives details of the implementation
    of such a method together with a numerical test of its potential.</p>"
