  content: "<p>New thermodynamic calculations have been made of the <sup>3</sup>He
    vapour-pressure scale using recently-published thermal and PVT data for the liquid
    and vapour phases. It is shown that by making reasonable choices of the data for
    the second and third virial coefficients of the vapour, and for the heat capacity
    of the liquid, good agreement can be obtained between a calculated vapour-pressure
    scale and recent experimental observations based on magnetic thermometry. These
    have revealed deviations of the ITS-90 from thermodynamic temperature of up to
    1 mK at 0,65 K.</p>"
