abstract:
- content: "<p>Elastic distortions in piston-cylinder units, used in primary standard
    piston gauges, are responsible for large uncertainties in pressure measurement
    values typically higher than 50 MPa. The present study considers the results obtained
    in the calculation of the pressure distortion coefficients of two 100 MPa piston-cylinder
    units and one 500 MPa unit. The calculation of distortions in the above piston-cylinder
    units follows the application of an analytical technique taking account iteratively
    of mechanical distortions and pressure distribution in the piston-cylinder clearance.
    The distortion values experimentally determined on the outer surface of the cylinders
    are compared with the calculated results. Pressure distributions in the piston-cylinder
    clearances, and piston and cylinder radial displacements, are calculated for various
    conditions of use and the results allow the pressure distortion coefficient of
    each unit to be obtained. Different effects on piston-cylinder units are evaluated
    to acquire useful information on piston gauges and to improve their accuracy.</p>"
