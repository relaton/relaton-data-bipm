  content: "<p>The construction of a Campbell type calculable mutual inductor is described.
    The two primary helices, 29 cm in diameter, are wound on a fused quartz former
    and the 495 turn secondary winding is about 51 cm in diameter on a glass former.
    The accuracy of the calculated value, which is nominally 10 mH, is 2.0 in 10<sup>6</sup>
    with a 95% probability.</p>"
