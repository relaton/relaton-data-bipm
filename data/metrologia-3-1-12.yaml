  content: "<p>A determination of the NPL unit of resistance in terms of the fundamental
    units of length and time has been made. It was based on a new, more accurate primary
    mutual inductor used with an improved Campbell bridge. Measurements in 1963 and
    1964, agreed to 0.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>; their mean value for the unit that is maintained
    by the NPL reference resistors is 1 - 3.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup> ohm with a probable
    error of 2 × 10<sup>-6</sup> ohm.</p>"
