  content: "<p>The lamp described was designed primarily as an alternative to the
    tungsten strip lamp, which is used as a temperature standard for radiation pyrometry,
    in order to obtain greater reproducibility and a higher maximum temperature. A
    close approximation to a black-body radiator is achieved by electrically heating
    in vacuo (to 1800 °C) or in argon (to 2700 °C,) a tungsten tube, 2 mm in diameter
    and 45 mm long, in which the radiating surface is a bundle of fine tungsten wire
    situated at the centre of the tube. The radiation emerges axially from an aperture
    1 mm in diameter near the end of the tube. Within the limits of ±0.2% no difference
    in emissivity could be detected over the wavelength range examined, namely 0.5
    to 0.7 μm and the absolute value of the emissivity was estimated to be not less
    than 0.95. The constancy of the current-temperature calibration of the vacuum
    lamp, when operated continuously at 1800 °C for at least 100 h is ±0.02 °C. At
    this temperature the vacuum lamp requires 29 A at 5 V. The argonfilled lamp can
    be operated at 2700 °C (56 A, 12 V) at which temperature a slow drift in calibration
    of about 0.05 °C/h occurs.</p>"
