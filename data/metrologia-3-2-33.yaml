abstract:
- content: "<p>A new electrostatic method for absolute measurements of voltage levels
    of standard cells is proposed. The method is based on Kelvin's plate electrometer
    with a guard ring. The electrometer is assumed to be symmetrically built with
    two pairs of electrode plates and the final balance of the system is made by means
    of a feedback system. The maximum error of the method is estimated to be in the
    order of 5 to 10 ppm.</p>"
