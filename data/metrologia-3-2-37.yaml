  content: <p>Quartzmetre gauges have been made and studied in Turku since 1927, when
    it was already possible to compare them with one another to 10<sup>-8</sup>, but
    the uncertainty of the absolute lengths based upon the calibration against the
    metre prototype was 20 times as large. In 1953 the BIPM calibrated two quartzmetres
    against the green line of the nuclide Hg<sup>198</sup>. This measurement was adopted
    as a basis (system "T"). The calibration performed in the P.T.B. gave a correction
    Δ<italic>T</italic> = +1.0 μm exceeding tenfold mean errors. The present writers
    then began to set up equipment to compare quartzgauges of different lengths so
    that the absolute length of 1 metre could be attained by additions. The provisional
    result, using the Hg<sup>198</sup> was Δ<italic>T</italic> = +1.12 μm. A new measurement
    recently performed by the BIPM gave Δ<italic>T</italic> = +1.27 μm. Investigations
    are still going on.</p>
