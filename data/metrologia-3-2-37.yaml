abstract:
- content: <p>Quartzmetre gauges have been made and studied in Turku since 1927, when
    it was already possible to compare them with one another to 10<sup>-8</sup>, but
    the uncertainty of the absolute lengths based upon the calibration against the
    metre prototype was 20 times as large. In 1953 the BIPM calibrated two quartzmetres
    against the green line of the nuclide Hg<sup>198</sup>. This measurement was adopted
    as a basis (system "T"). The calibration performed in the P.T.B. gave a correction
    ΔT = +1.0 μm exceeding tenfold mean errors. The present writers then began to
    set up equipment to compare quartzgauges of different lengths so that the absolute
    length of 1 metre could be attained by additions. The provisional result, using
    the Hg<sup>198</sup> was ΔT = +1.12 μm. A new measurement recently performed by
    the BIPM gave ΔT = +1.27 μm. Investigations are still going on.</p>
