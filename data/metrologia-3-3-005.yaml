abstract:
- content: "<p>The work of the Comité Consultatif de Thermométrie since its first
    meeting in 1939 is described. It includes the intercomparison of standard instruments
    designed to verify the agreement between the national laboratories in the realisation
    of the International Practical Temperature Scale, studies of the fixed points
    and the interpolation equations. The relation between the I.P.T.S. and the thermodynamic
    scale is kept under continuous study, and a provisional scale has been propozed
    to extend the I.P.T.S. from the boiling point of oxygen (90.18 °K) to the triple
    point of hydrogen (13.809 °K).</p>"
