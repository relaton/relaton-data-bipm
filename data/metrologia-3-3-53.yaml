abstract:
- content: "<p>The usefulness of platinum resistance thermometers in the 2–10 °K region
    has been assessed on the basis of their sensitivity, stability and ease of calibration.
    It is concluded that many of these instruments may be used to measure temperatures
    with an overall accuracy of about 0.03–0.05 deg in a fairly convenient manner,
    and with an accuracy of about 0.01 deg if considerable care is taken. In some
    cases, however, thermometer stability poses serious limitations on accuracy.</p>"
