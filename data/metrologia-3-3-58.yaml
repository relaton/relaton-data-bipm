abstract:
- content: "<p>The knowledge of the density of water, accurate to within 1.10<sup>-3</sup>
    kg/m<sup>3</sup>, is an urgent necessity to-day, especially in oceanography. At
    the present time, this degree of accuracy is far from being attained.</p><p>A
    review of basic works on the subject is given. Absolute determinations on the
    density of air-free water at 4 °C and under pressure of one normal atmosphere
    have been carried out between 1895 and 1905. The value obtained, 999.972 kg/m<sup>3</sup>,
    is not related to a definite isotopic composition of water and, therefore, no
    longer has a precise meaning. The laws of variation with temperature, pressure
    and concentration in dissolved atmospheric gases, in usage to-day, are discussed.
    As yet, only the law of variation with pressure, in the region of atmospheric
    pressure, is sufficiently accurate to be used in calculating the density.</p><p>A
    brief account of the isotopic composition of natural waters is given. A relationship
    between density and isotopic composition is proposed, which should be submitted
    to experimental verification. An estimate is made of the differences in density
    between two samples of natural water of different isotopic compositions.</p><p>The
    need is emphasized for a new comprehensive experimental study regarding the problem
    of the density of water.</p>"
