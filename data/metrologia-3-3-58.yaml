    <p>The knowledge of the density of water, accurate to within 1.10<sup>-3</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>, is an urgent necessity to-day, especially in oceanography. At the present time, this degree of accuracy is far from being attained.</p>
    <p>A review of basic works on the subject is given. Absolute determinations on the density of air-free water at 4 °C and under pressure of one normal atmosphere have been carried out between 1895 and 1905. The value obtained, 999.972 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, is not related to a definite isotopic composition of water and, therefore, no longer has a precise meaning. The laws of variation with temperature, pressure and concentration in dissolved atmospheric gases, in usage to-day, are discussed. As yet, only the law of variation with pressure, in the region of atmospheric pressure, is sufficiently accurate to be used in calculating the density.</p>
    <p>A brief account of the isotopic composition of natural waters is given. A relationship between density and isotopic composition is proposed, which should be submitted to experimental verification. An estimate is made of the differences in density between two samples of natural water of different isotopic compositions.</p>
    <p>The need is emphasized for a new comprehensive experimental study regarding the problem of the density of water.</p>
