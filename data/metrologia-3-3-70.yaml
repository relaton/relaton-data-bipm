  content: "<p>The principle, design, and performance of thallium beam frequency standards
    are described. Recent measurements of the Tl<sup>205</sup> hyperfine structure
    separation are given. The values, obtained with different frequency standards,
    are near 21, 310, 833, 946 Hz in the A. 1 time scale. The range covered is 7 parts
    in 10<sup>11</sup>. The marked advantage of thallium frequency standards over
    cesium standards is that their sensitivity to magnetic effects is about one-fiftieth
    as great. Thallium standards would be expected to be superior to cesium standards
    in applications where precision better than the order of a part in 10<sup>12</sup>,
    or long term stability of better than the order of a part in 10<sup>13</sup>,
    is wanted without need for measuring, or elaborately controlling, the C-field
    in the atomic beam tube.</p>"
