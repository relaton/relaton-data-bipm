abstract:
- content: "<p>It is shown how a particular phenomenon arising from the ac Josephson
    effect in superconductors can be used to provide a comparatively simple and inexpensive
    means for (1) checking on the constancy in time of reference standards of electromotive
    force, and (2) relating the reference standard of one country to that of another
    country, thereby contributing to a better international assignment of the volt.
    The results of recent high accuracy (4 ppm) measurements of the phenomenon in
    question and the relative ease with which the techniques used in these measurements
    can be extended to the 1 ppm level will be presented as evidence that these two
    goals can be reached in the near future.</p>"
