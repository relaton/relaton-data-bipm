abstract:
- content: "<p>The accuracy of radioactivity measurements is discussed in the context
    of current efforts to achieve reproducible results among standards laboratories.
    This is considered essentially a problem of selecting an absolute method of measurement
    and defining the experimental requirements in sufficient detail for general use.
    A further analysis of coincidence counting is made in an attempt to define more
    clearly the conditions under which this method may provide acceptable accuracy.</p>"
