abstract:
- content: "<p>A detailed description is given of a 1-metre line-standard interferometer
    which has been constructed at the National Standards Laboratory, Sydney. The results
    of a recent series of calibrations of standard scales are reported. A precision
    of 10<sup>7</sup> has been obtained. The existence of a difference between the
    optical metre as defined in 1960 and the prototype metre is confirmed, and the
    optical metre is found to be 0.38 Î¼m shorter than the prototype.</p>"
