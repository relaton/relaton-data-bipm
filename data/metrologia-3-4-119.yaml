abstract:
- content: "<p>The thermal and spectral radiation characteristics of the cylindrical
    enclosures used in the primary standard of light are studied in detail. The temperatures
    at the walls and base of the cylindrical ceramic sight-tubes are calculated on
    the basis of thermo-dynamic equilibrium. The effect of the spectral emissivity
    of the ceramic on the apparent spectral emissivity of the base is studied. Changes
    of about one percent in the luminance of the base can occur with the sight-tubes
    that have commonly been used. The effect of a temperature gradient in the surrounding
    ingot is also considered. A practical design is suggested which should permit
    realization of the primary standard of light with a luminance error, caused by
    the sight-tube, of not more than 0.1%.</p>"
