abstract:
- content: "<p>The nuclear quadrupole resonance frequency of<sup>35</sup>Cl in KClO<sub>3</sub>
    has been studied in the temperature range 12 °K - 297 °K. The combined uncertainties
    in the frequency and temperature measurements correspond to ± 0.001 °K in the
    range 50 °K - 297 °K, deteriorating to ± 0.004 °K at 30 °K and ± 0.010 °K at 20
    °K. Both the nuclear resonance spectrometer and the temperature control apparatus
    are described. The experimental data are fitted to a theoretical expression in
    the temperature range 12 °K - 90 °K; at higher temperature the data are fitted
    to empirical polynomials.</p>"
