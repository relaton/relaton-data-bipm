abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of impedance measuring systems has been
    carried out between the following laboratories: NPL (UK), NIST (United States
    of America), PTB (Federal Republic of Germany), CSIRO (Australia) and VSL (the
    Netherlands), with the NPL acting as pilot laboratory. Eight items covering a
    range of conductance and capacitance values, all fitted with G900 precision 14
    mm connectors, were measured at 100, 200 and 300 MHz. The results presented in
    this paper show excellent agreement within the quoted uncertainty limits for most
    items and frequencies. The comparison was sponsored by the Radio Frequency Working
    Group (GT-RF) of the Comité Consultatif d'Électricité (CCE) of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and was identified by the reference GT-RF/78-11.</p>"
