abstract:
- content: <p>The geometry and construction of electromechanical systems based on
    the levitation of a superconducting mass strongly influence the level of uncertainty
    they can achieve in realizing the "mechanical" joule. The authors give some recommendations
    for designers of systems of the next generation based on their experience with
    the apparatus at the VNIIM.</p>
