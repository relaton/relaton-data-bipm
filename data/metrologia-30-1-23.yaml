  content: "<p>Equilibrium freezing points of four silver ingots were intercompared.
    A spread of values of about 18 mK was found between the, presumably, purest and
    the most impure sample. The influence of furnace temperature upon the plateau
    temperature, via non-equilibrium effects at the solid-liquid interface, is discussed.</p>"
