  content: "<p>In this paper results obtained on the effect of line pressure on the
    zero stability of a differential quartz Bourdon gauge are presented. The gauge
    studied has a helical fused-quartz Bourdon tube as the pressure-sensing element
    with an electromagnetic nulling device. The full scale pressure range of the gauge
    is 110 kPa. Zero shift values at different line pressures for various gases under
    different conditions have been measured. It is observed that when the line pressure
    is increased from an initial pressure of zero, the zero shift is negative: conversely,
    it is positive for decreasing line pressures. The magnitude of the zero shift
    for all the gases under different experimental conditions is found to be directly
    proportional to the change in the line pressure. The results obtained for helium
    and hydrogen show a completely different behaviour of the quartz Bourdon gauge
    from those observed for nitrogen, argon and oxygen. An analysis of the experimental
    results reveals that this gauge behaves in different ways with different gases.
    The possible causes of this behaviour are briefly discussed.</p>"
