abstract:
- content: "<p>The extent and causes of air refractivity differences in industrial
    environments have been assessed at the level of less than 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup>
    by the PTB and the NPL using a refractometer instrumentation package capable of
    both direct measurement and calculation of the refractive index of the atmosphere
    using an interference refractometer and atmospheric sensor measurements. The results
    of these measured and calculated values are discussed, together with the comparison
    of a number of industrial air refractivity measurement sensors.</p>"
