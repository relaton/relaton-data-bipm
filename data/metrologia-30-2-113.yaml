  content: "<p>The 1994 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements will
    be held Monday 27 June to Friday 1 July 1994 in Boulder, Colorado, USA. The purpose
    of the bienennial meetings of the CPEM is to exchange information on a wide range
    of topics on precise electromagnetic measurements. These topics include:\n <list
    list-type=\"unordered\">\n <list-item><p>Advanced instrumentation including new
    sensors and measurement methods</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>Automated measurement
    methods</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>Dielectric and antenna measurements</p></list-item>\n
    <list-item><p>Direct current and low-frequency measurements</p></list-item>\n
    <list-item><p>Fundamental constants and special standards</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>Laser,
    optical fibre and optical electronic measurements</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>RF,
    microwave and millimetre-wave measurements</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>Superconducting
    and other low-temperature measurements</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>Time and
    frequency measurements</p></list-item>\n</list></p>\n<p>CPEM'94 will be extended
    to five days to provide for added special sessions on the fundamental physical
    constants. The CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants plans to carry out the
    next least-squares adjustment of the fundamental constants in 1995 with a cutoff
    date for input data that is shortly after CPEM'94. Thus, CPEM'94 provides a particularly
    timely forum for discussion of results important to the 1995 adjustment.</p>\n<p>The
    conference language will be English. Authors are requested to submit an abstract
    and summary by 18 January 1994. If the paper is accepted, the author will be notified
    and encouraged to prepare a full paper for  <italic>IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation
    and Measurement</italic>.</p>\n<p><bold>Conference Chairman</bold></p>\n<p>Donald
