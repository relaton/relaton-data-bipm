  content: "<p>Radiation thermometry is applied in the measurement of temperature
    where direct contact with the object is impossible, such as in the case of very
    high temperatures or moving bodies. Important industrial applications are metal,
    glass, ceramics and plastics and, latterly, semiconductor technology.</p>\n<p>Recent
    developments, such as multi-wavelength pyrometry, have motivated the Nederlands
    Meetinstituut and two Russian institutes, Energotechnica and Symco Association,
    to organize this workshop. Specialists from Russia, the USA, the UK, Germany and
    the Netherlands will present state-of-the-art practical applications in radiation
    thermometry.</p>\n<p>The workshop will be held on 24 and 25 June 1993 in the \"Leeuwenhorst\"
    Congress Centre, Noordwijkerhout, the Netherlands. Information on the technical
    contents of the programme can be obtained from Dr P Bloembergen, Tel. +31(15)
    691 660.</p>\n<p><bold>Registration</bold></p>\n<p>For further details please
