    from the international metrological community; mathematicians from Italian universities
    (Politecnico of Torino, Milano, Università di Genova, Milano, Padova, Roma, Trento);
    scientists and mathematicians from national standards institutes and the Italian
    National Research Council.</p><p>The workshop will be of interest to people in
    universities, research centres and industry who are involved in measurement and
    need advanced mathematical tools to solve their problems, and to those who work
    in the development of these mathematical tools.</p><p>Metrology is concerned with
    measurement at the highest level of precision. Advances in metrology depend on
    many factors: improvements in scientific and technical knowledge, instrumentation
    quality, better use of advanced mathematical tools and the development of new
    tools. In some countries, metrological institutions have a tradition of close
    cooperation between metrologists and mathematicians, and include a division of
    applied mathematics. Such a tradition is lacking in Italy and the objective of
    this workshop is to encourage such cooperation by calling upon scientists from
    mathematical and metrological fields to meet and to exchange experiences. Industrial
    sectors, particularly those concerned with instrumentation and software, are likely
    to benefit, since metrology makes a high impact on the overall quality of industrial
    products, and applied mathematics must now be seen as an important industrial
    process.</p>"
