abstract:
- content: <p>A modified system of SI units is described that includes a new category
    of "physiological units". In this system, physiological units are a special class
    of derived units that are defined with respect to specified reference stimuli
    for the purpose of calibrating the nominal human response to external physical
    effects. This new category includes the unit of luminous intensity, the candela,
    and the unit of dose equivalent, the sievert. By comparison with the current SI,
    in the modified SI the candela is classified as a physiological derived unit instead
    of as a base unit and the definition of the sievert is revised to include specification
    of the reference radiation.</p>
