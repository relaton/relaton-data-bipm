abstract:
- content: "<p>Apparent mass differences due to free convection were measured for
    1 kg mass standards. The observed temperature dependence was analysed, also that
    of some 20 g artefacts reported earlier. A model based on estimates of the convective
    heat transfer rate and the overall average velocity of the convective air current
    was used to interpret the experimental results.</p>"
