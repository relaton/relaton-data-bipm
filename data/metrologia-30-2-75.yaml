  content: "<p>We have measured the ratio of the NMR spin precession frequencies of
    optically pumped low pressure helium-3 and of protons in water, using free induction
    decay. This was done by direct substitution in a flux density of 0,1 T of samples
    in an accurately spherical 25 mm diameter sample cell, without removing the sample
    cell from the magnet. The water measurements were corrected to 25°C. The two sets
    of measurements were each referred to a 10 mm diameter spherical reference water
    sample which was ratioed out. A new method was devised to measure and correct
    for the different averaging of the residual inhomogeneities in the magnetic field
    by the helions and by the protons in the water. Our final result is μ<sub>h</sub>
    (<sup>3</sup>He)/μ'<sub>p</sub>= − 0,761 786 131 3(33). Using the CODATA 1986
    recommended value for γ́<sub>p</sub> gives γ<sub>h</sub>/2π = 32,434 092 1(97)
    MHz T<sup>-1</sup>. Combining the result with a measurement of γ<sub>h</sub> (<sup>3</sup>He)/γ<sub>p</sub>
    (H<sub>2</sub> gives the shielding factor of H<sub>2</sub> as σ<sub>H<sub>2</sub></sub>
    = 26,350(19) × 10<sup>-6</sup>, in good agreement with a theoretical value. Combining
    our result with a measurement of μ́<sub>p</sub>/μ<sub>B</sub> yields μ<sub>h</sub>
    (<sup>3</sup>He)/μ<sub>B</sub>= − 1,158 671 471(14) × 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p>"
