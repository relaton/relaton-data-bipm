abstract:
- content: "<p>The Russian global space navigation system GLONASS could provide a
    technique similar to GPS for international time comparison. The main limitation
    to its use for time transfer is the lack of commercially available time receivers.
    The University of Leeds built a GPS/GLONASS receiver five years ago and since
    then has provided continuous information about GLONASS time and its comparison
    with GPS time. For the last two years the VNIIFTRI and several other Russian time
    laboratories have used Russian-built GLONASS navigation receivers for time comparisons.
    Since June 1991, the VNIIFTRI has operated a GPS time receiver which offers, for
    the first time, an opportunity for the direct comparison of time transfers using
    GPS and GLONASS. This seven-month experiment shows that even with relatively imprecise
    data recording and processing, in terms of time metrology, GLONASS can provide
    continental time transfer at a level of several tens of nanoseconds.</p>"
