  content: "<p>An automated interferometer equipment is described which can be used
    for calibration of gauge blocks with lengths up to 1 000 mm. The main advantage
    of the new type of interferometer is that no prior knowledge on the length of
    the gauge block is required. The measurement method is based on scanning and it
    utilizes a white-light source and one stabilized 633 nm laser. White-light interference
    signals from the reference flat and from the front surface of the gauge block
    indicate the distance to be measured with the laser. The final length is determined
    from the average laser-signal phase shift between the gauge and the reference
    flat. Environmental conditions are measured and the necessary corrections are
    made automatically. An integrating sphere used for evaluation of the surface roughness
    correction is described. Results of the various test measurements with both short
    and long gauge blocks are given. The estimated overall uncertainty (2 Ïƒ) is 30
    nm for a 100 mm gauge block and 160 nm for a 1 000 mm gauge block. Repeatability
    of wringing is the main source of uncertainty with short gauge blocks. With long
    gauge blocks, the accuracy is limited by uncertainty in the temperature of the
    gauge and in the air refractive index.</p>"
