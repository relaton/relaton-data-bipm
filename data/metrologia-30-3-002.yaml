abstract:
- content: "<p>To examine the stability of prototypes of the kilogram after cleaning,
    surface analysis techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
    were applied to specimens cut from prototype material of Pt-10% Ir alloy. Traditional
    steam-jet cleaning (SJC) was compared with ultrasonic cleaning with solvents (UCS)
    in terms of cleaning effects and the progress of contamination. The results show
    that mass changes due to metallic factors such as oxidation, reduction and dissolution
    were negligibly small. In terms of carbon decrease and adsorption of water, UCS
    was superior to SJC. From analyses of peak area ratio by XPS, it was shown that
    the cleaner the surfaces, the higher the rate of contamination. But the contamination
    levels converged to a common value after a six-month exposure to air, irrespective
    of the cleaning method used. This finding is of great importance for the preservation
    of prototypes. The contaminating substances were found to be hydrocarbons from
    the ambient air. The mass gain for the surfaces of a prototype due to hydrocarbons
    after a six-month exposure to ambient air is estimated to be 4,3 μg for SJC and
    16 μg for UCS.</p>"
