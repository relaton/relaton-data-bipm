abstract:
- content: "<p>We report a complete description of a frequency standard based on the<sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub>-<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub><sup>24</sup>Mg
    transition at 601 GHz; in particular the metastable atomic source, the Ramsey-type
    interaction region, the submillimetric frequency synthesizer and the frequency-control
    loop are described both theoretically and experimentally. The main experimental
    results concerning the operation of the atomic beam, the Ramsey signal intensity
    and width versus some important parameters and the signal-to-noise ratio, with
    and without optical pumping, are reported and compared with theoretical predictions.
    The clock transition frequency has been measured with respect to UTC (IEN) with
    an uncertainty of ± 1 × 10<sup>-12</sup>; at present the frequency instability
    reaches the value of 2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for counting times of 3 000 s and the
    repeatability the level of 3 × 10<sup>-13</sup>. The accuracy budget is also reported
    and discussed as are possible improvements of the present prototype.</p>"
