- content: "<p>This meeting, organized by the Paul Scherrer Institute's Department
    of Applied Solid State Physics, will be held from 27–30 March 1994 at the Hotel
    Regina-Titlis, Engelberg, Switzerland. The aim is to bring together scientists
    from two important fields of current research and increasing industrial relevance.
    Optical metrology is a traditional discipline of applied optics which reached
    the nanometre scale a long time ago. Nanotechnology is setting new limits and
    represents a major challenge to metrology, as well as offering new opportunities
    to optics.</p><p>The meeting is intended to help define a common future for optical
    metrology and nanotechnology. Topics to be covered include:<p>nanometre position
    control and measuring techniques</p><p>ultrahigh precision interferometry</p><p>scanning
    probe microscopy (AFM, SNOM, etc.)</p><p>surface modification by scanning probe
    methods</p><p>precision surface fabrication and characterization</p><p>nanolithography</p><p>micro-optics,
    diffractive optics components, including\tsystems and applications</p><p>subwavelength
    optical structures</p><p>synthetic optical materials</p><p>structures and technologies
    for X-ray optics.</p></p><p>For further information please contact: \nJens Gobrecht
    (Secretary), Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232 Villigen-PSI, Switzerland. Tel.
    (41)56992529; Fax (41) 5698 2635.</p>"
