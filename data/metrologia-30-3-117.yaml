  content: "<p>The magnetostatics of cylindrical superconductors with parallel axes
    is formally analogous to the electrostatics of cylindrical normal conductors of
    the same geometry, provided that the London penetration depth can be neglected.
    This analogy when applied to the Thompson-Lampard theorem of electrostatics, which
    forms the basis of the calculable capacitor, leads to a method of deriving an
    SI standard of dc resistance, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>, given by <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>
    = μ<sub>0</sub> <italic>c</italic> (π/log 4) (<italic>f</italic><sub>J</sub>/<italic>f</italic><sub>opt</sub>)
    (<italic>n</italic><sub>fr</sub>/<italic>n</italic><sub>fq</sub>), where μ<sub>0</sub>
    <italic>c</italic> is the impedance of vacuum, <italic>f</italic><sub>J</sub>
    is the Josephson frequency of the voltage across the potential terminals of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>,
    <italic>f</italic><sub>opt</sub> is the optical frequency of an interferometer
    light source, <italic>n</italic><sub>fr</sub> is an optical interferometer fringe
    count and <italic>n</italic><sub>fq</sub> is a SQUID flux-quantum count. This
    paper gives the theory of the method, and offers some further theoretical results
    that point to the practical feasibility of the standard.</p>"
