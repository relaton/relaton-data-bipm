  content: "<p>Improvements to the NRC HeNe/CH<sub>4</sub> laser have produced a stable
    infrared source at 88 THz suitable for checking the stability of the CO<sub>2</sub>
    laser frequencies in the NRC phase-locked frequency chain. About 30 000 1 s average
    readings of the 88 THz laser frequency were obtained over the period 89-03-29
    to 91-05-10. The Allan deviation σ<sub>y</sub>(1 s) of each CO<sub>2</sub> laser
    frequency in the chain was determined to be less than 2,5 × 10<sup>-12</sup> (82
    Hz), when a new NRC hydrogen maser was used as a reference. The standard deviation
    of the mean of samples containing between 592 and 1 390 1 s average readings of
    the HeNe/CH<sub>4</sub> frequency, obtained on a given day, ranged from a fractional
    value 7,1 × 10<sup>-14</sup> to 3,0 × 10<sup>-13</sup>. The weighted standard
    deviation of 34 determinations of the HeNe/CH<sub>4</sub> laser frequency, obtained
    at various times over this period, was 73 Hz (8,3 × 10<sup>-13</sup>), and the
    mean frequency relative to the frequency derived from the International Atomic
    Time scale (TAI) was 88 376 181 599 431(73)Hz. Other tests showed no significant
    systematic errors in the phase-locked CO<sub>2</sub> laser frequencies.</p>"
