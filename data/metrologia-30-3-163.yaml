  content: "<p>We report a complete description of a frequency standard based on the
    <sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub>-<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub> <sup>24</sup>Mg transition
    at 601 GHz; in particular the metastable atomic source, the Ramsey-type interaction
    region, the submillimetric frequency synthesizer and the frequency-control loop
    are described both theoretically and experimentally. The main experimental results
    concerning the operation of the atomic beam, the Ramsey signal intensity and width
    versus some important parameters and the signal-to-noise ratio, with and without
    optical pumping, are reported and compared with theoretical predictions. The clock
    transition frequency has been measured with respect to UTC (IEN) with an uncertainty
    of ± 1 × 10<sup>-12</sup>; at present the frequency instability reaches the value
    of 2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for counting times of 3 000 s and the repeatability the
    level of 3 × 10<sup>-13</sup>. The accuracy budget is also reported and discussed
    as are possible improvements of the present prototype.</p>"
