abstract:
- content: <p>For about one year the time scales UTC (OCA) and UTC (TUG) were compared
    by means of GPS common-view and two-way satellite time transfer. At the end of
    the experiment, both links were independently "calibrated" by measuring the differential
    delays of the GPS receivers and the satellite Earth stations by transportation
    of one GPS receiver and one satellite terminal to the other site. The results
    obtained by the two methods differ by about 3 ns, but reveal a seasonal variation
    of about 8 ns which, most likely, is mainly the result of temperature-dependent
    delays in the GPS receiving equipment used.</p>
