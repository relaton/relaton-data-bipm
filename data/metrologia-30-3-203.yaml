abstract:
- content: "<p>The workshop is organized by two Italian institutions, the Istituto
    di Metrologia \"G Colonnetti\" (IMGC) of the\nConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,
    and the Institute of General Physics \"A Avogadro\" of the University of Torino.\nIt
    will be held in Torino from 9 to 11 March 1994 at Villa Gualino, where accommodation
    for participants is\navailable. The programme of the workshop includes plenary
    sessions of invited lectures and a final round table.</p><p>The main subject of
    the workshop will be the determination of the Avogadro constant through the measurement
    of the molar and atomic volume of single crystal silicon, but other methods will
    be analysed and discussed and experimental results compared with estimates obtained
    from the adjustment of the fundamental constants.</p><p>The aims of the workshop
    are:<p>state-of-the-art assessment</p><p>improved coordination of research work</p><p>definition
    of expected progress</p><p>discussion of the possibility of a new definition of
    the unit of mass.</p></p><p>The lecturers are eminent experts in their fields,
    which include X-ray and optical interferometry, measurement of density, molar
    mass and impurity content of silicon crystals. The workshop Proceedings will be
    published in a special issue of Metrologia.</p><p>Participation is free but the
    number of places is limited. Registration forms (to be returned no later than
    20 December 1993) and requests for the detailed programme should be addressed
    to G Mana, Istituto di Metrologia \"G Colonnetti\", Strada delle Cacce 73, 1-10135
    Torino, Italy. \nTel. (011) 39771; Fax (011) 346 761; E-mail LIDIA at IMGC.TO.CNR.IT.</p>"
