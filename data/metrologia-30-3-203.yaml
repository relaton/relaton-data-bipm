  content: "<p>The workshop is organized by two Italian institutions, the Istituto
    di Metrologia \"G Colonnetti\" (IMGC) of the\nConsiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche,
    and the Institute of General Physics \"A Avogadro\" of the University of Torino.\nIt
    will be held in Torino from 9 to 11 March 1994 at Villa Gualino, where accommodation
    for participants is\navailable. The programme of the workshop includes plenary
    sessions of invited lectures and a final round table.</p>\n<p>The main subject
    of the workshop will be the determination of the Avogadro constant through the
    measurement of the molar and atomic volume of single crystal silicon, but other
    methods will be analysed and discussed and experimental results compared with
    estimates obtained from the adjustment of the fundamental constants.</p>\n<p>The
    aims of the workshop are:\n <list list-type=\"unordered\">\n <list-item><p>state-of-the-art
    assessment</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>improved coordination of research work</p></list-item>\n
    <list-item><p>definition of expected progress</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>discussion
    of the possibility of a new definition of the unit of mass.</p></list-item>\n</list></p>\n<p>The
    lecturers are eminent experts in their fields, which include X-ray and optical
    interferometry, measurement of density, molar mass and impurity content of silicon
    crystals. The workshop Proceedings will be published in a special issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>.</p>\n<p>Participation
    is free but the number of places is limited. Registration forms (to be returned
    no later than 20 December 1993) and requests for the detailed programme should
    be addressed to G Mana, Istituto di Metrologia \"G Colonnetti\", Strada delle
    Cacce 73, 1-10135 Torino, Italy. \nTel. (011) 39771; Fax (011) 346 761; E-mail
