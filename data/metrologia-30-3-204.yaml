  content: "<p>This meeting, organized by the Paul Scherrer Institute's Department
    of Applied Solid State Physics, will be held from 27–30 March 1994 at the Hotel
    Regina-Titlis, Engelberg, Switzerland. The aim is to bring together scientists
    from two important fields of current research and increasing industrial relevance.
    Optical metrology is a traditional discipline of applied optics which reached
    the nanometre scale a long time ago. Nanotechnology is setting new limits and
    represents a major challenge to metrology, as well as offering new opportunities
    to optics.</p>\n<p>The meeting is intended to help define a common future for
    optical metrology and nanotechnology. Topics to be covered include:\n <list list-type=\"unordered\">\n
    <list-item><p>nanometre position control and measuring techniques</p></list-item>\n
    <list-item><p>ultrahigh precision interferometry</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>scanning
    probe microscopy (AFM, SNOM, etc.)</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>surface modification
    by scanning probe methods</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>precision surface fabrication
    and characterization</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>nanolithography</p></list-item>\n
    <list-item><p>micro-optics, diffractive optics components, including\tsystems
    and applications</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>subwavelength optical structures</p></list-item>\n
    <list-item><p>synthetic optical materials</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>structures
    and technologies for X-ray optics.</p></list-item>\n</list></p>\n<p>For further
