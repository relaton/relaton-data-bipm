- content: "<p>This meeting, organized by the Paul Scherrer Institute's Department
    of Applied Solid State Physics, will be held from 27–30 March 1994 at the Hotel
    Regina-Titlis, Engelberg, Switzerland. The aim is to bring together scientists
    from two important fields of current research and increasing industrial relevance.
    Optical metrology is a traditional discipline of applied optics which reached
    the nanometre scale a long time ago. Nanotechnology is setting new limits and
    represents a major challenge to metrology, as well as offering new opportunities
    to optics.</p><p>The meeting is intended to help define a common future for optical
    metrology and nanotechnology. Topics to be covered include:<list list-type=\"unordered\"><list-item><p>nanometre
    position control and measuring techniques</p></list-item><list-item><p>ultrahigh
    precision interferometry</p></list-item><list-item><p>scanning probe microscopy
    (AFM, SNOM, etc.)</p></list-item><list-item><p>surface modification by scanning
    probe methods</p></list-item><list-item><p>precision surface fabrication and characterization</p></list-item><list-item><p>nanolithography</p></list-item><list-item><p>micro-optics,
    diffractive optics components, including\tsystems and applications</p></list-item><list-item><p>subwavelength
    optical structures</p></list-item><list-item><p>synthetic optical materials</p></list-item><list-item><p>structures
    and technologies for X-ray optics.</p></list-item></list></p><p>For further information
    please contact: \nJens Gobrecht (Secretary), Paul Scherrer Institute, CH-5232
    Villigen-PSI, Switzerland. Tel. (41)56992529; Fax (41) 5698 2635.</p>"
