abstract:
- content: "<p>Two independent methods of measurement were used to determine the absolute
    spectral responsivity and external quantum efficiency of light-trapping silicon
    photodiode packages. These trap packages were calibrated first by the NIST High
    Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer at laser wavelengths of 633 nm and 442 nm. They
    were also measured in the NIST Spectral Comparator Facility with working standards
    traceable to a 100% quantum efficient radiometer (QED-200). The two sets of measurements
    agree to better than 0,1% at 633 nm and 0,25% at 442 nm.</p>"
