abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured the electrical and radiometric properties of a cryogenic
    bolometer/amplifier which is intended for use as a transfer standard in an infrared
    spectral comparator facility under development at the NIST. We have found its
    sensitivity to be similar 20 pW, instability &lt;1%, responsivity similar 1,7
    Ã— 10<sup>6</sup> V/W, spatial nonuniformity &lt;1% and nonlinearity &lt;1% over
    five decades. These results show that this device can be used for its intended
    purpose as an IR detector transfer standard.</p>"
