abstract:
- content: "<p>Progress in characterizing two bolometric absolute radiometers is described.
    Spatial variation in responsivity over the receivers is less than 0,2%, variation
    in responsivity between the four bolometers is less than 0,3% and their response
    relative to a photodiode was linear to within experimental uncertainty. Observations
    of noise in the radiometer heating power are reported and discussed.</p>"
