abstract:
- content: "<p>A national standard of low background irradiance from 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>
    to 10<sup>-3</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> has been created at the Research Institute
    for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI, Moscow). The standard is based on a cryogenic
    radiometer and a low temperature black body (LTBB) variable in temperature from
    80 K to 300 K.</p>"
