abstract:
- content: "<p>The system of radiometric and photometric standards at the PTB is presented,
    emphasizing traceability, cross-linking, and future developments. Traceability
    from the national standards to the respective reference standards of calibration
    laboratories of the German Calibration Service (DKD) is also included. The future
    realization of the detector-based spectral irradiance scale resulting in a reduced
    uncertainty is described.</p>"
