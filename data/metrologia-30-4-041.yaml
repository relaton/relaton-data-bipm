abstract:
- content: "<p>At the PTB radiometric scales are compared which are based on electrodynamics
    (electron storage ring BESSY), on thermodynamics (black body of known temperature
    T<sub>90</sub> of the International Temperature Scale) and on a thermal detector
    in combination with the electrical substitution principle (cryogenic radiometer).
    The uncertainty contributions of the different input parameters for establishing
    the independent radiometric scales are analysed in detail. According to this analysis
    spectral radiant powers in the visible are realized or expected to be realized
    (black body) with uncertainties (1 σ level) of 0,10% (BESSY), of 0,07% (black
    body, λ&gt;650 nm) and of 0,007% (cryogenic radiometer). Filter radiometers calibrated
    at the three independent primary standards are used as transfer instruments for
    the comparison. The measured values of the responsivities of the filter radiometers
    are estimated to be uncertain by 0,11% (BESSY), 0,08% (black body, λ&gt;650 nm),
    and 0,03% (cryogenic radiometer). Preliminary experimental results of the comparison
    between BESSY and the cryogenic radiometer are in agreement with the uncertainty
    analysis.</p>"
