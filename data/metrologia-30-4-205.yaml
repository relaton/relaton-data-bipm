abstract:
- content: "<p>The Proceedings published in this special issue of Metrologia are from
    New Developments and Applications in Optical Radiometry IV, also known as the
    NEWRAD '92 Conference. The conference was held from 5–7 October 1992 in Baltimore,
    Maryland, USA, and was organized through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The 1992 Conference
    was the fourth in a series of occasional international meetings held to integrate
    the activities of the space radiometry community with those of the laboratory
    metrology community.</p><p>The location of Maryland was chosen to bring the meeting
    back to the hemisphere of the Americas where the first of the series was held.
    NASA/Goddard was chosen as the sponsoring organization for this meeting because
    of the number and diversity of space measurement programmes which are managed
    there, and because of its proximity to the United States National Institute of
    Standards and Technology.</p><p>The general organization of the meeting included
    sessions on the Earth Observing System (which I chaired), the Shuttle Atlas I
    Mission and UV Calibrations (chaired by E Hilsenrath, NASA/Goddard), Cryogenic
    Radiometry (N Fox, NPL), Detector Radiometry (T Quinn, BIPM), Space-based Applications
    (J Metzdorf, PTB) and Ground-based Applications (C Cromer, NIST). Thirty-eight
    papers were presented orally, and poster sessions were also provided. Most of
    the presentations are represented in these Proceedings. The fifth meeting in this
    occasional series is scheduled for 19–21 September 1994 in Berlin. The Conference
    institutional host is the PTB, and the convener is Dr Joachim Fischer, Secretary.</p><p>The
    success of the meeting derived principally from the individual contributions of
    the presenters and the interest and attention of all the participants. The success
    of these Proceedings is attributable to the individual authors, the guest editors
    and the referees of the papers. Each paper was subjected to a critical review
    which was organized by the chairman of the session in which the paper was presented.
    The work of the guest editors and referees is gratefully acknowledged.</p><p>The
    drawing together of the papers in Metrologia format was carried out most capably
    by Dr David Blackburn and his staff. Without his help and encouragement the review
    process may never have converged to produce this publication.</p>"
