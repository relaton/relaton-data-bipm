  content: "<p>An anecdotal history of the evolution of satellite remote sensors for
    making Earth observations in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet spectral regions
    during the past three decades at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) is presented together with an intercomparison of the earlier scanning remote
    sensors and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) of the Earth
    Observing System (EOS) project. Developments in the pre-launch and in-flight radiometric
    calibration systems and techniques for these satellite remote scanners, sounders
    and television imagers are highlighted.</p>"
