abstract:
- content: "<p>The EOS Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) will study the
    ecology and climate of the Earth through acquisition of global multi-angle imagery.
    The MISR employs nine discrete cameras, each a push-broom imager. Of these, four
    point forward, four point aft and one views the nadir. Absolute radiometric calibration
    will be obtained pre-flight using high quantum efficiency (HQE) detectors and
    an integrating sphere source. After launch, instrument calibration will be provided
    using HQE detectors in conjunction with deployable diffuse calibration panels.
    The panels will be deployed at time intervals of one month and used to direct
    sunlight into the cameras, filling their fields-of-view and providing through-the-optics
    calibration. Additional techniques will be utilized to reduce systematic errors,
    and provide continuity as the methodology changes with time. For example, radiation-resistant
    photodiodes will also be used to monitor panel radiant exitance. These data will
    be acquired throughout the five-year mission, to maintain calibration in the latter
    years when it is expected that the HQE diodes will have degraded. During the mission,
    it is planned that the MISR will conduct semi-annual ground calibration campaigns,
    utilizing field measurements and higher resolution sensors (aboard aircraft or
    in-orbit platforms) to provide a check of the on-board hardware. These ground
    calibration campaigns are limited in number, but are believed to be the key to
    the long-term maintenance of MISR radiometric calibration.</p>"
