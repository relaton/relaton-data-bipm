  content: "<p>The CERES instrument has three radiometers which operate in the short-wave
    (0,3 μm to 5 μm), the long-wave (8 μm to 12 μm) and total broadband (0,3 μm to
    &gt;200 μm) spectral regions. The long-wave calibration plan for CERES provides
    for absolute radiometric calibration of the two CERES sensors operating in the
    long-wave portion of the spectrum. Ground calibration is carried out in the TRW
    Radiometric Calibration Facility (RCF), a cryogenic vacuum chamber with the capability
    to simulate radiometrically both cold space and Earth viewing conditions. Absolute
    calibration is made using a temperature-based radiometric scale created by a black-body
    radiance standard controlled at temperatures from 200 K to 320 K. In May 1992,
    the CERES radiometric test model (RTM), a developmental but functionally flight-like
    instrument, was calibrated at TRW in the RCF. This was the first end-to-end long-wave
    calibration of a CERES sensor and provided a test and initial validation of the
    long-wave calibration plan and procedures. The gain, offset, out-of-field response
    and spectral response were determined for each sensor. The end-to-end long-wave
    calibration plan is described and the RTM calibration and validation results are
    presented.</p>"
