abstract:
- content: "<p>Pre-flight and in-flight radiometric calibration plans are described
    for a multispectral optical imager of high spatial resolution for remote sensing
    of land surfaces and clouds from orbit, which will be launched in 1998 on NASA's
    EOS-AM1 spacecraft. The instrument named ASTER consists of three radiometers for
    three separate spectral regions, the visible and near-infrared radiometer (VNIR),
    the shortwave infrared radiometer (SWIR), and the thermal infrared radiometer
    (TIR). Absolute radiometric accuracy to better than 4% is required for the VNIR
    and SWIR radiance measurements, and from 1 K to 3 K, depending on the temperature
    region, from 200 K to 370 K for the TIR temperature measurements. The basic approach
    to in-flight calibration is to introduce a reference beam at the front end of
    the radiometer to calibrate the whole system in orbit. Thus the ASTER instrument
    is installed with internal on-board calibration units which include, as reference
    sources, incandescent lamps for the VNIR and SWIR and a black-body radiator for
    the TIR. Calibration reliability of the VNIR and SWIR is enhanced by a dual system
    of on-board calibration units and high stability halogen lamps. A ground calibration
    system of spectral radiances traceable to fixed-point black bodies is used for
    the pre-flight VNIR and SWIR calibrations.</p>"
