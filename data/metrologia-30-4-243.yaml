abstract:
- content: "<p>The SSBUV is part of the National Plan for monitoring the stratosphere.
    Ozone monitoring from space employs backscatter ultraviolet-type instruments on
    NOAA operational, NASA research and foreign environmental satellites. The SSBUV
    provides calibration data for these instruments using nearly coincident observations
    of the Earth's ultraviolet albedo from a series of Space Shuttle flights. The
    SSBUV also measures the middle ultraviolet solar irradiance as part of the ozone
    measurement. A major requirement for the SSBUV is that its calibration be known
    to about 1% from one flight to the next. To achieve this, the SSBUV conducts a
    rigorous calibration program involving multiple standard sources and detectors.
    The SSBUV has now flown four times, over a thirty-month period beginning in October
    1989. This paper deals with the calibration and radiometric stability before and
    after each of four Shuttle flights and is an update to the results reported after
    the first SSBUV flight. For the more recent flights, laboratory calibration precision
    continues to be better than 1%. Instrument sensitivity continued to degrade by
    1% to 3% after each flight, and is wavelength dependent. Measurements of the solar
    irradiance in the wavelength region 200 nm to 400 nm have a precision of 1% to
    2% from one flight to the next. Comparison of the SSBUV and the NOAA-11 SBUV-2
    solar irradiance measurements indicates that the SBUV-2 instrument is degrading
    less than 1% per year at wavelengths longer than 300 nm and by as much as 6% per
    year at wavelengths shorter than 250 nm.</p>"
