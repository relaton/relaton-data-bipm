abstract:
- content: "<p>We report results of an investigation of a lamp for spectral calibration
    that is based upon molecular fluorescence. An argon ion laser is used to excite
    the B state of molecular iodine and the resulting fluorescence provides a series
    of lines that cover the wavelength range 515 nm to 1 340 nm. The intensities of
    the lines are fixed with respect to one another and are appropriate for determining
    the relative spectral responsivity of an optical instrument. We discuss a specific
    example that demonstrates the salient features of this lamp.</p>"
