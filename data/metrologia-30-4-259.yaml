abstract:
- content: "<p>Historically, flat-plate diffusers of measured angular scattering properties
    are illuminated by NIST standards of spectral irradiance to provide a calculated
    spectral radiance standard in the wavelength region 250 nm to 340 nm for space-borne
    SBUV-2 instruments used to determine long-term changes in stratospheric ozone.
    Correspondingly, space-borne large-aperture scanning radiometers used to measure
    spectroradiometric properties of Earth scenes in the red and near-infrared regions
    have used internally illuminated integrating spheres. The spectral radiance of
    the aperture of an integrating sphere is calculated from its spectral irradiance
    which is referenced to NIST standards of spectral irradiance. Spectral radiance
    calibration constants in the region 250 nm to 340 nm derived using the flat-plate
    diffuser and spherical integrator techniques agree to within 1% in the wavelength
    region from 250 nm to 340 nm. The results presented are for the radiometric calibration
    of the SBUV-2 flight model number two which is the next instrument scheduled for
    flight.</p>"
