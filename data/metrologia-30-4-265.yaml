abstract:
- content: "<p>The need exists for a very stable, portable radiometer which can transfer
    readings from an absolute measuring cryogenic radiometer operating in a vacuum
    chamber to other laboratories. This will allow electro-optical instruments operating
    in either air or vacuum to be calibrated relative to the single absolute measuring
    cryogenic standard. It will also allow characterization of vacuum chamber windows
    by comparing measurements made in front of and behind the windows. To perform
    these functions the transfer standard must have good radiometric sensitivity and
    long-term repeatability in both air and vacuum. It must be reasonably compact
    and portable and must operate over a wide range of ambient temperatures. Ideally,
    the transfer standard is linear over a large dynamic range with direct readout
    in watts or watts/cm<sup>2</sup> or watts/cm<sup>2</sup>Â·sr and has a flat spectral
    response from UV to far-infrared wavelengths. Such a transfer standard radiometer
    utilizing a dualcavity detector is described. The dynamic range, radiometric accuracy
    and long-term stability of the transfer standard radiometer is presented. Stability
    data of better than 0,001% per day in air is shown.</p>"
