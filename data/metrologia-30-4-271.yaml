abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents the results from a comparative study of solar total
    irradiance data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) on board the
    Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), and the Solar Maximum Mission Active
    Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor-1 (SMM/ACRIM), for the overlap period 25
    October 1984 to 5 July 1989. Both measurements used active-cavity radiometers
    (ACR). For days when measurements are available from both satellites, the mean
    difference in the irradiance values is 2,18 WÂ·m<sup>-2</sup>. The data show good
    agreement both in the details of the day-to-day variations and in the long-term
    trends. The irradiance variations observed in the measurements track the solar
    activity cycle quite well. The amplitude of the solar cycle related irradiance
    variation is 0,1%. For the period October 1984 to July 1989, a correlation coefficient
    of 0,781 is obtained for the two data sets. The correlation becomes stronger with
    the increase in solar activity, but breaks down for low solar activity periods.
    Independent studies of ERBS/ERBE and Nimbus-7/ERB; SMM/ACRIM and Nimbus-7/ERB
    also show high correlation between the data sets during high solar activity periods.</p>"
