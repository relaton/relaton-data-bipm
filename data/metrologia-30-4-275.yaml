abstract:
- content: "<p>The Solar Ultraviolet Radiation and Correlative Emissions (SOURCE)
    mission is intended to advance our ability to specify the spectral irradiance
    of the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelength range through simultaneous,
    radiometrically accurate measurements of the solar EUV spectral irradiance and
    measurements, including EUV and visible images, of solar parameters that are correlated
    with the EUV flux. The data will be used in combination with empirical modelling
    to develop and validate a more accurate system of proxy, or surrogate, indices
    for the solar EUV flux.</p>"
