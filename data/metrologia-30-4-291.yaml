abstract:
- content: "<p>The PTB primary standards for radiant power in Braunschweig are the
    German national standard for detector calibrations within the spectral range of
    200 nm to 2,5 Î¼m. This paper presents the progress in development and optimization
    of a high accuracy measurement facility using a cryogenic radiometer as the primary
    standard. The following features are highlighted: method of dynamic power substitution;
    temperature dependence of the absorptance of the cavity; error reduction by distance-error-free
    calibration transfer; and concept of window-correction-free transfer.</p>"
