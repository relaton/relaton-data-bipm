  content: "<p>Different types of photodiode have been characterized with respect
    to uniformity, linearity, stability of responsivity and temperature coefficient
    at several wavelengths between 257 nm and 799 nm based on cryogenic radiometry
    and intensity stabilized lasers. The Hamamatsu S1337 photodiode was found to be
    the best suited for use as a high accuracy transfer standard for both the visible
    and UV spectral regions. For low-level radiant power measurement, this kind of
    photodiode can be calibrated via a cryogenic radiometer with a total uncertainty
    as low as ±0,02% in the visible and ±0,25% in the UV.</p>"
