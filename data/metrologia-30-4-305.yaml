abstract:
- content: "<p>The Cryogenic Solar Absolute Radiometer (CSAR) is a new primary radiometric
    standard for use in space and traceable to the International System of Units (SI).
    The CSAR will be capable of measuring the total irradiance of the Sun with an
    uncertainty of 0,01%, and a resolution of 0,001%, more than a factor of ten improvement
    over existing instruments. The standard is at present under development and is
    part of a proposal, Absolute Radiometric Measurements in Space (ARMS), which has
    been submitted to the European Space Agency in response to a Call for Opportunities
    for Columbus Pre-Cursor Flights. The CSAR is currently on the provisional payload
    of EURECA III.</p>"
