  content: "<p>A technique is presented for realizing spectral irradiance using a
    large-area, high temperature, uniform, black-body source and filter-radiometers
    that are calibrated using a High Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer. The method will
    be studied by calibrating irradiance lamps with this new technique and comparing
    the results with those obtained by the method currently employed at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Progress to date and preliminary
    results are presented. The ultimate goal of the programme is to reduce the measurement
    uncertainties in the spectral irradiance scales that are made available to industry
    by calibrating deuterium and tungsten-halogen irradiance lamps.</p>"
