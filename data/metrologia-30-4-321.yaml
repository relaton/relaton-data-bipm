  content: "<p>The paper describes the properties of a new large area InGaAs photodiode
    with near unity internal quantum efficiency. Measurements of linearity, spatial
    uniformity and dark current of the photodiodes are presented and compared with
    measurements on germanium photodiodes. The paper also describes the performance
    of a detector constructed from an arrangement of three of these photodiodes and
    shows how it has a calculable responsivity from 980 nm to 1 640 nm. It also describes
    how such a detector can be used as a sensor for a fibre-optic power meter with
    an uncertainty of around 0,1%.</p>"
