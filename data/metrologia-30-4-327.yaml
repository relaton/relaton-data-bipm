abstract:
- content: "<p>A brief history of the development of quantum-efficient detectors and
    their incorporation into light-trapping configurations is presented. Various light-trapping
    schemes are surveyed. A new refractive configuration is described which yields
    the largest field-of-view reported to date.</p>"
