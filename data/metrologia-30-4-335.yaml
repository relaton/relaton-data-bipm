abstract:
- content: "<p>The differential spectral responsivity method has been used to determine
    the linearity of large-area Ge detectors near room temperature. The nonlinearity
    caused by using a traditional transimpedance amplifier is discussed and the applicability
    of a bootstrapping technique to compensate for the low shunt resistance of the
    photodiode is shown. The detectors were found to be linear up to a saturation
    limit which is nearly independent of wavelength. The temperature dependence of
    the saturation level is also described.</p>"
