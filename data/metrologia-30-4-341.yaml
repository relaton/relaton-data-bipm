  content: "<p>The goal of the Low Background Infrared (LBIR) calibration facility
    at the NIST is to provide the infrared user community with a measurement base
    for both broadband and spectral radiometric calibrations in a low background environment.
    The standard detector used in this facility is the Absolute Cryogenic Radiometer
    (ACR). The ACR is an electrical substitution radiometer which is capable of measuring
    between 20 nW and 100 Î¼W of radiant power. By using an optical trap detector,
    an intercomparison with the ACR is made as part of a programme to monitor the
    long-term stability of the ACR. A comparison is also made between the optical
    trap detector and an in-house trap detector that was calibrated using the High
    Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer (HACR).</p>"
