  content: "<p>The errors associated with modelling the quantum efficiency of high
    quality silicon photodiodes in the ultraviolet using the semiconductor device-modelling
    program PC1D are discussed. Uncertainty spectra have been calculated for these
    errors, which are mainly a result of the application of basic solid-state models
    and parameters in the extreme case of ultraviolet absorption. The more critical
    parameters have been identified and, where possible, corrections have been made
    to account for them. The overall uncertainty associated with quantum efficiency
    modelling is found to be well below 0,2% for detection of radiation from 400 nm
    to 300 nm, and below 1% for radiation down to 250 nm.</p>"
