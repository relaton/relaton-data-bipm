abstract:
- content: "<p>Fatigue effects in germanium photodetectors were observed and studies
    carried out to determine the main components of these effects. Irradiance level,
    spectral distribution of the incident radiation and irradiated surface on the
    detector all play an important part in the existence and magnitude of fatigue
    effects. The time needed to recover the initial characteristics was also studied.</p>"
