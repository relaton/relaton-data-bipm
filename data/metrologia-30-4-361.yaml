  content: "<p>We have carried out high resolution spatial measurements of the surface
    reflectance and responsivity of single and trap-configured silicon photodiodes
    at laser wavelengths between 325 nm and 780 nm. The results indicate that the
    spatial nonuniformity of quantum efficiency for a given photodiode varies with
    laser wavelength and internal structure. For radiometric quality diodes this nonuniformity
    of response leads to uncertainties in detector measurements which can be reduced
    to 0,03% or better.</p>"
