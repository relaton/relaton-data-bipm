abstract:
- content: "<p>A new radiometric method which employs quantum properties of radiation
    and does not require the use of standard radiation sources and receivers has been
    suggested. This method uses the process of three-photon down conversion in non-central-symmetrical
    media to measure the quantum efficiency of photodetectors.</p>"
