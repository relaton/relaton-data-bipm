abstract:
- content: "<p>On board the ESA/NASA space mission SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
    there will be several VUV telescope/spectrometer systems to observe the solar
    disk and its corona in the wavelength range 15 nm to 160 nm. To determine the
    absolute spectral sensitivity of these instruments prior to launching, transfer
    source standards have been developed. These transfer standards consist of a high-current
    hollow cathode source combined with collimating optics. One standard uses a concave
    mirror at normal incidence for the wavelength range 50 nm to 160 nm and the other
    standard uses Wolter type II grazing incidence optics for the range 16 nm to 80
    nm. These transfer source standards are calibrated against the electron storage
    ring BESSY as a primary radiometric source standard.</p>"
