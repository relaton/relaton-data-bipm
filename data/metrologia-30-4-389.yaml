abstract:
- content: "<p>The stabilities of type 715, T-1, tungsten calibration lamps were evaluated
    aboard three spacecraft platforms during the period 1984 to 1989. In the 0,2 μm
    to &lt;5,0 μm broadband spectral region, the emitted radiant power from each lamp
    was measured using shortwave thermistor bolometers and active-cavity radiometers.
    The radiant power was found to be constant to ±1%. The responses of filter and
    silicon photodiode monitoring systems used to evaluate the lamps were found to
    degrade as much as 6% during the first two years in orbit.</p>"
