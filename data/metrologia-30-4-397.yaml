abstract:
- content: "<p>The ultraviolet spectrometers on the Voyager spacecraft are radiometrically
    stable and presently capable of making long-term, precise measurements of the
    solar spectral irradiance between 50 nm and 170 nm. If the detection efficiencies
    of these spectrometers were confirmed through a dedicated program of underflights,
    and if a campaign of regular Voyager observations of the Sun was instituted, some
    of the needs for timely, long-term solar EUV flux data could be efficiently met
    in this decade</p>"
