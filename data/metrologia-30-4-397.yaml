  content: "<p>The ultraviolet spectrometers on the <italic>Voyager</italic> spacecraft
    are radiometrically stable and presently capable of making long-term, precise
    measurements of the solar spectral irradiance between 50 nm and 170 nm. If the
    detection efficiencies of these spectrometers were confirmed through a dedicated
    program of underflights, and if a campaign of regular <italic>Voyager</italic>
    observations of the Sun was instituted, some of the needs for timely, long-term
    solar EUV flux data could be efficiently met in this decade</p>"
