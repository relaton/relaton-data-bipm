  content: "<p>The Atmospheric Optical Calibration System (AOCS) was developed at
    the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for making real-time, terrestrially based
    measurements of selected optical properties of the atmosphere. The original application
    of the AOCS was to provide measurements of atmospheric optical conditions pertinent
    to outdoor photovoltaic (PV) device performance measurements. It addresses the
    dependence of outdoor PV test results on the characteristics of the incident solar
    radiation that are dependent on these constantly changing atmospheric optical
    conditions. This paper describes the AOCS, its calibration and its application
    to PV testing. Additional applications related to the measurement of atmospheric
    optical properties are also mentioned.</p>"
