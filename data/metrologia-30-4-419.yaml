  content: "<p>A review is presented of recent claims on the effects of partial coherence
    in radiometric measurements, particularly in relation to spectral irradiance intercomparisons.
    It is shown that for practical sources typically used in radiometric laboratories,
    effects claimed to be due to partial coherence are equivalent to those of diffraction
    and interference associated with the use of extended sources. The relative importance
    of these effects may then be estimated using existing literature on diffraction
    corrections in radiometry. Estimates of the importance of coherence may be made
    from comparison of coherence dimensions with aperture sizes; where small apertures
    are used, coherence theory may be required to superimpose correlated fields.</p>"
