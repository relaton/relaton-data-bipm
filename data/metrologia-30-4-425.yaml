  content: "<p>Two spectral responsivity scales have been established at the National
    Physical Laboratory, UK. High quantum efficiency silicon photodiodes have been
    used to establish a continuous spectral responsivity scale for the spectral region
    400 nm to 920 nm. The scale can be disseminated by the NPL with an uncertainty
    of ±0,1%. Pyroelectric detectors fitted with a reflecting hemispherical cavity
    have been used to establish a spectral responsivity scale for the spectral region
    1 μm to 20 μm. This scale has an uncertainty of less than ±1,6%.</p>"
