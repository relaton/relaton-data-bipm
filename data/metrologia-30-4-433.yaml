abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance of high power carbon dioxide and free electron lasers
    depends upon the quality of mirrors used in them. A precise characterization of
    mirrors is required, and this is achieved by employing reference standards. Standards
    for the calibration of reflectance scale for the infrared region are not available.
    The present work describes the development of a specular reflectance standard
    at glancing angles of incidence from 10° to 70° for the 2,5 μm to 25 μm infrared
    region. Whereas aluminium and gold mirrors have been used as high reflectance
    value standards, single and double surface polished silicon and germanium have
    been employed as standards at low reflectance values.</p>"
