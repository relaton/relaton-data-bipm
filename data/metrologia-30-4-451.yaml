abstract:
- content: "<p>The 1994 Conference on Precision Electromagnetic Measurements will
    be held Monday 27 June to Friday 1 July 1994 in Boulder, Colorado, USA. The purpose
    of the bienennial meetings of the CPEM is to exchange information on a wide range
    of topics on precise electromagnetic measurements. These topics include:<list
    list-type=\"unordered\"><list-item><p>Advanced instrumentation including new sensors
    and measurement methods</p></list-item><list-item><p>Automated measurement methods</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dielectric
    and antenna measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p>Direct current and low-frequency
    measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fundamental constants and special standards</p></list-item><list-item><p>Laser,
    optical fibre and optical electronic measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p>RF,
    microwave and millimetre-wave measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p>Superconducting
    and other low-temperature measurements</p></list-item><list-item><p>Time and frequency
    measurements</p></list-item></list></p><p>CPEM'94 will be extended to five days
    to provide for added special sessions on the fundamental physical constants. The
    CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants plans to carry out the next least-squares
    adjustment of the fundamental constants in 1995 with a cutoff date for input data
    that is shortly after CPEM'94. Thus, CPEM'94 provides a particularly timely forum
    for discussion of results important to the 1995 adjustment.</p><p>The conference
    language will be English. Authors are requested to submit an abstract and summary
    by 18 January 1994. If the paper is accepted, the author will be notified and
    encouraged to prepare a full paper for IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and
    Measurement.</p><p>Conference Chairman</p><p>Donald B Sullivan, National Institute
    of Standards and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80303, USA</p><p>Technical

    and Technology, 325 Broadway, Boulder, Colorado 80303, USA</p><p>For further information,
