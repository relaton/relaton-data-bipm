abstract:
- content: "<p>An expression for the noise temperature of an arbitrarily shaped microwave
    cavity is derived and illustrated. The result is applied to a horn/cavity noise
    source and forms the basis for a set of primary reference noise standards that
    covers the millimetre wave frequency range in thirteen bands from WR-42 to WR-3.
    Power attenuation coefficients for sectoral horns are also presented.</p>"
