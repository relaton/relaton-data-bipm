abstract:
- content: "<p>In the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) the primary standard
    for on-line flowrate measurements using the laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) technique
    has been extended to a three-component LDA to improve velocity profile measurements
    in the boundary layers of a nozzle flow. The LDA flowrate measuring facility now
    consists of a two-colour argon ion LDA and a wavelength-stabilized GaAlAs diode
    laser LDA. The gas flowrate is obtained by numerical integration of the measured
    velocity profiles across the exit plane of the nozzle. High local resolution of
    the velocity profile measurements is achieved by perpendicular orientation of
    the measurement volumes of the two-component gas laser LDA and the semiconductor
    diode laser LDA (LD-LDA). This allows the resolution in the boundary layer to
    be improved significantly to velocity gradients. The present work presents the
    LD-LDA system for precise velocity profile measurements at flow velocities of
    up to 120 m/s; selected profile measurements are described in detail to demonstrate
    the high resolution and the symmetry of the flow profile. For the first time a
    wavelength-stabilized miniaturized diode laser LDA has been successfully applied
    in precise velocity measurements, and comparisons with well-established gas laser
    LDAs have been made. The uncertainty of the flowrate measurement up to 5 500 m<sup>3</sup>/h
    is 0,1% for air at atmospheric pressure. A turbine gas meter, type Elster G2500,
    was calibrated with the LDA and used as a transfer standard for an intercomparison
    with the Nederlands Meetinstituut (NMI) in the flowrate range up to 5 500 m<sup>3</sup>/h
    with and without the installation of perforated plates to condition the flow in
    the inlet section of the gas meter. The results of the comparison experiment clearly
    show the reliability and accuracy of the online flowrate measurement of gases
    and underline the necessity for a detailed research programme to investigate the
    relationship between installation effects, upstream flow conditions and the measurement
    uncertainty of gas meters. The design of a test rig now under construction at
    the PTB is shown. This will allow the diode laser LDA technique to be applied
    to the measurement of installation effects according to OIML Recommendation R-32.</p>"
