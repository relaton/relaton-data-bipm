abstract:
- content: "<p>The estimation of individual instabilities of N clocks, when only differences
    of clock readings are available, is examined without any a priori assumption about
    the lack of correlation between clocks. The instability of the N clocks is described
    by the N × N covariance matrix R but only the (N - 1) × (N - 1) covariance matrix
    S of the differences referred to the N-th clock may be estimated directly from
    measurements. The estimation of R from S is not unique but the solution domain
    is limited by the positive definiteness of R. The features of this domain are
    analysed and the conditions for the validity of the uncorrelation hypothesis are
    established. The modifications of the solution domain, when the number N of compared
    clocks increases, is examined showing that each added clock can reduce the domain
    and therefore the arbitrariness in estimating R. Examples with some experimental
    data illustrate the capabilities of this approach.</p>"
