  content: "<p>The estimation of individual instabilities of <italic>N</italic> clocks,
    when only differences of clock readings are available, is examined without any
    a priori assumption about the lack of correlation between clocks. The instability
    of the <italic>N</italic> clocks is described by the <italic>N × N</italic> covariance
    matrix <italic>R</italic> but only the (<italic>N</italic> - 1) × (<italic>N</italic>
    - 1) covariance matrix <italic>S</italic> of the differences referred to the <italic>N</italic>-th
    clock may be estimated directly from measurements. The estimation of <italic>R</italic>
    from <italic>S</italic> is not unique but the solution domain is limited by the
    positive definiteness of <italic>R</italic>. The features of this domain are analysed
    and the conditions for the validity of the uncorrelation hypothesis are established.
    The modifications of the solution domain, when the number <italic>N</italic> of
    compared clocks increases, is examined showing that each added clock can reduce
    the domain and therefore the arbitrariness in estimating <italic>R</italic>. Examples
    with some experimental data illustrate the capabilities of this approach.</p>"
