abstract:
- content: "<p>A general approach to comparisons in the presence of temporal drift
    is presented and comparison sequences are discussed for linear, quadratic and
    cubic drift. Circular comparison sequences of the form (ab..)<sub>n</sub> and
    (ab..)<sub>n</sub> a are proposed (where a, b,.. are different items, such as
    masses, and n is a repeat factor) with the best performance achieved when three
    to five items are involved in the comparison. A matrix least squares model is
    used to obtain information about the drift, the item differences and their uncertainties.
    The emphasis of the paper is on mass comparisons, where the dominant drift is
    in the balance zero, but the approach is applicable to comparisons generally and
    its application to gain drift is also presented.</p>"
