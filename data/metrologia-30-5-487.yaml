  content: "<p>A general approach to comparisons in the presence of temporal drift
    is presented and comparison sequences are discussed for linear, quadratic and
    cubic drift. Circular comparison sequences of the form (ab..)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>
    and (ab..)<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> a are proposed (where a, b,.. are different
    items, such as masses, and <italic>n</italic> is a repeat factor) with the best
    performance achieved when three to five items are involved in the comparison.
    A matrix least squares model is used to obtain information about the drift, the
    item differences and their uncertainties. The emphasis of the paper is on mass
    comparisons, where the dominant drift is in the balance zero, but the approach
    is applicable to comparisons generally and its application to gain drift is also
    presented.</p>"
