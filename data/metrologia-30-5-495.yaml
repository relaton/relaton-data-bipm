abstract:
- content: "<p>To evaluate uncertainty in mass measurements with accuracy and in accordance
    with recent international documents, a general model is developed, which takes
    account of the various contributing quantities in a multivariate context. On this
    basis, the variance-covariance matrix of the in-vacuo mass differences is constructed
    in its general form and tailored for application to some of the most commonly
    adopted weighing methods. The usual assumption of equal-variance, uncorrelated
    observations is shown to be inappropriate for mass comparisons.</p>"
