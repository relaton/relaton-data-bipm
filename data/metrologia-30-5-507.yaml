abstract:
- content: "<p>Mass spectrometric analysis shows that platinum resistance thermometers
    become contaminated by exposure to Ag and Cu at high temperatures. To study the
    rate at which such contamination occurs, bundles of Pt wires in quartz tubes were
    soaked in a silver fixed-point furnace. The results suggest that the sensing element
    of a platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) inserted into an Ag-contaminated thermometer
    well will begin to become contaminated after approximately 400 hours of accumulated
    use at the silver point. The experimental results suggest that the contamination
    may be avoided by interposing an additional, disposable quartz tube between the
    contaminated thermometer well and the PRT.</p>"
