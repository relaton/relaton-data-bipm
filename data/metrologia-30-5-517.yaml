  content: "<p>Each coherent system of units is based on a system of quantities in
    such a way that the equations between the numerical values expressed in coherent
    units have exactly the same form, including numerical factors, as the corresponding
    equations between the quantities. The highest international body responsible for
    the International System of Units (SI) is the Conférence Générale des Poids et
    Mesures (CGPM). However, the CGPM is not concerned with quantities or systems
    of quantities. That question lies within the scope of Technical Committee number
    twelve of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/TC 12). Quantities,
    units, symbols, conversion factors. To fulfil its responsibility, ISO/TC 12 has
    prepared the International Standard ISO 31, <italic>Quantities and Units</italic>,
    which consists of fourteen parts. The new editions of the different parts of the
    International Standard are briefly presented here.</p>"
