abstract:
- content: "<p>After three and a half centuries the Torricellian mercury manometer
    remains the most accurate pressure standard. State-of-the-art manometers achieve
    parts-per-million total uncertainties near atmospheric pressures and imprecisions
    as low as 0,01 Pa. The total uncertainty is determined primarily by uncertainties
    in the measurement of the height of the mercury surfaces and the average mercury
    density. The latter is limited generally by the uncertainty of the average temperature
    of the mercury. The techniques used to locate the mercury surfaces and determine
    their heights not only determine the imprecision and accuracy of the height measurement,
    but can also have a significant effect on the maintenance of a stable and uniform
    mercury temperature. This review discusses the factors important in high-accuracy
    manometers with particular emphasis on surface detection and height measurement
    techniques. Specifically discussed are capacitance detection, white-light fringes,
    optical interferometry, with and without floats, and ultrasonic measurements.</p>"
