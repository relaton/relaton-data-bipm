abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements have been performed to investigate the gas dependence
    of the absolute mode effective area A<sub>eff</sub> of a piston gauge. The gases
    studied were H<sub>2</sub>,<sup>3</sup>He,<sup>4</sup>He, N<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>
    and SF<sub>6</sub>. The data obtained were used to determine ΔA<sub>eff</sub>
    ≡ A<sub>eff</sub> (gas) - A<sub>eff</sub> (N<sub>2</sub>) in the pressure range
    1,4 kPa to 103 kPa for<sup>3</sup>He and 1,4 kPa to 162 kPa for H<sub>2</sub>,<sup>4</sup>He,
    CO<sub>2</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>. Above 1,4 kPa, the uncertainty in ΔA<sub>eff</sub>
    was ⩽ 2 parts per million. The measurements yielded effective area differences
    ranging from 26 ppm at 1,4 kPa to 4 ppm at 45 kPa; from 100 kPa to 162 kPa, the
    maximum difference, to within the resolution of the measurements, was constant
    at 6 ppm to 7 ppm.</p>"
