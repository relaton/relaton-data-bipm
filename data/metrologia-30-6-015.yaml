abstract:
- content: "<p>It is now possible to construct pressure balances for use as primary
    pressure standards with a reproducibility of less than 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. It
    is possible to characterize them in the SI system with an uncertainty of approximately
    5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. It would be satisfying to obtain a stability of the same
    order of magnitude and so ensure the same long-term uncertainty. This paper presents
    the methods used to check the stability of the piston-cylinder assemblies and
    describes the results obtained over a period of more than fifteen years.</p>"
