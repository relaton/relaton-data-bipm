abstract:
- content: "<p>Pressure metrologists and other research workers have always aimed
    at the accurate determination of the distortion coefficient Î» characterizing the
    effective area of a pressure balance. This paper presents a novel and unique treatment
    which incorporates both the elastic distortions of the piston and the cylinder,
    and the pressure-viscosity effect. The Finite Element method is used to calculate
    the elastic distortions, but an iterative solution is obtained for the pressure-viscosity
    effect. An extensive validation of the developed computer models have been carried
    out and one new finding is reported. It is concluded that for balances with complex
    geometries the distortion coefficient depends on the geometrical and material
    properties of a balance as well as on its operating pressure.</p>"
