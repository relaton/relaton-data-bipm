abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method is presented for the determination of the effective area
    and pressure distortion function of piston-cylinder assemblies taking into account
    only the geometric and physical configuration of the piston (being independent
    of the cylinder). The results obtained from the application of this method to
    the characterization of a piston-cylinder assembly constructed from tungsten carbide
    are also presented and several conclusions are drawn.</p>"
