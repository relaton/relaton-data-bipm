abstract:
- content: "<p>Primary standard piston gauges are frequently used to perform pressure
    comparisons, but at other times, and particularly in the pressure range greater
    than 300 MPa, suitable transfer standards are used for the same purpose. The IMGC
    and the NIST have completed a bilateral intercomparison for gauge pressure measurements
    in liquid media up to 600 MPa using a strain-gauge pressure transducer as the
    transfer standard. The main metrological characteristics of the transducer are
    discussed, particularly the stability with time and the uncertainty limits for
    use as a transfer standard. The pressure scale between 100 MPa and 600 MPa as
    maintained by the two laboratories is described, and the results of the comparison
    are discussed in order to demonstrate the agreement in pressure measurement between
    the IMGC and the NIST.</p>"
