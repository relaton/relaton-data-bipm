  content: "<p>The mercury U-tube manometer is a traditional pressure-measuring instrument
    and has played an important role as the primary standard in the atmospheric pressure
    range. It has also been used as the basis of standards for other pressure ranges.
    About thirty-five years ago, the National Research Laboratory of Metrology developed
    the precise mercury manometer using a white-light Michelson interferometer to
    detect the mercury menisci. We now introduce a new mercury U-tube manometer, developed
    as a national primary standard, to which some improvements and refinements have
    been added. Though the central principle is the same, the optical path of the
    reference arm of the interferometer has been redesigned to reduce the index-of-refraction
    corrections and some improvements have been incorporated to achieve more precise
    measurements on the U-tube conditions. The pressure range of the new manometer
    is 116 kPa and the uncertainty at 100 kPa is estimated to be about 0,4 Pa, in
    both absolute and gauge modes.</p>"
