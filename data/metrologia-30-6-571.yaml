abstract:
- content: "<p>A new family of primary standards for both absolute and relative pressures
    in the range 1 kPa to 120 kPa has been designed at the IMGC. The standards make
    use of laser interferometry, with floats supporting cube-corner retroreflectors,
    to detect the mercury menisci inside a U-tube and measure their vertical displacements.
    A description of the first apparatus, HG-3, and an evaluation of its measurement
    uncertainties are given; the overall uncertainty (at the ± 1 σ level) is lower
    than ± 0,24 Pa at 1 kPa and ± 0,46 Pa at full scale. A second-generation instrument,
    HG-5, now being constructed, includes several significant improvements, among
    which are better control and measurement of temperature and a different interferometric
    configuration.</p>"
