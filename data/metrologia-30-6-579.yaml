  content: "<p>This paper describes the principle and performance of a novel manometer
    developed for the measurement of pressures in the range of up 1 kPa. A heterodyne
    interferometer using a Zeeman stabilized He-Ne laser was used to detect the displacement
    of oil surfaces which reflect the laser beam directly. A system of double U-tube
    and double interferometer was used to compensate errors caused by thermal and
    vibrational disturbances. The total uncertainty of the measured pressure <italic>P</italic>
    is estimated to be Â± (2,1 + 0,032 <italic>P</italic>/Pa)mPa for gauge-mode pressures.
    The operation of the manometer has been confirmed by the calibration of three
    capacitance diaphragm gauges at gauge-mode pressures of up to 876 Pa.</p>"
