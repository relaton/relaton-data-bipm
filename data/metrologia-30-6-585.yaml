abstract:
- content: "<p>While hydraulic piston gauge technology dates from the mid-1800s, the
    first practical gas-lubricated pneumatic piston gauges for metrological applications
    were not developed until almost one hundred years later. The major reason for
    this delay was the need for adequate materials and machining technology to fabricate
    pistons and cylinders with tight enough tolerances for acceptable instrument operation.
    As the need for reduced uncertainties increased for gas pressure measurements
    in the ranges covered by manometry and above, technological improvement in gas-operated
    piston gauges advanced rapidly. Requirements for the development of high-quality
    air bearings added stimulus to the push for improved piston and cylinder technology.
    Investigations into the possible use of pneumatic piston gauges as primary pressure
    standards competitive with manometry had begun by 1965. Although lack of a fundamental
    detailed model of the vertical momentum transfer from the moving gas to the flanks
    of the piston currently somewhat limits this application, improvements in understanding
    and technology are continually being made. The relatively recent discoveries of
    the sometimes significant dependence of the effective area of certain pneumatic
    piston gauges on the gas species used during operation, or on whether the gauge
    is operating in the gauge or absolute mode, underscore the need for continued
    research in this field.</p>"
