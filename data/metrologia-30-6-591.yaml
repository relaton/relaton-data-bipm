  content: "<p>Gas-operated pressure balances as primary standards for absolute pressure
    are discussed, with emphasis on obtaining the effective area from the piston-cylinder
    dimensions and the mass in vacuum of the pressure balance floating element. The
    performance of one 35 kPa pressure balance is presented showing that an accuracy
    of better than 10 ppm can be achieved. Repeat measurements of the piston-cylinder
    dimensions ten years apart gave the same calculated effective areas to within
    3 ppm. These calculated areas vary by up to 2 ppm with gas pressure and gas type.
    Comparison with two interferometric manometers, using other nitrogen gas-operated
    pressure balances as transfer standards, resulted in effective areas -7 ppm and
    2,6 ppm different from the area calculated from the piston-cylinder dimensions.</p>"
