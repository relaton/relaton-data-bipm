  content: "<p>Measurements have been performed to investigate the gas dependence
    of the absolute mode effective area <italic>A</italic><sub>eff</sub> of a piston
    gauge. The gases studied were H<sub>2</sub>, <sup>3</sup>He, <sup>4</sup>He, N<sub>2</sub>,
    CO<sub>2</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>. The data obtained were used to determine Δ<italic>A</italic><sub>eff</sub>
    ≡ <italic>A</italic><sub>eff</sub> (gas) - <italic>A</italic><sub>eff</sub> (N<sub>2</sub>)
    in the pressure range 1,4 kPa to 103 kPa for <sup>3</sup>He and 1,4 kPa to 162
    kPa for H<sub>2</sub>, <sup>4</sup>He, CO<sub>2</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>. Above
    1,4 kPa, the uncertainty in Δ<italic>A</italic><sub>eff</sub> was ⩽ 2 parts per
    million. The measurements yielded effective area differences ranging from 26 ppm
    at 1,4 kPa to 4 ppm at 45 kPa; from 100 kPa to 162 kPa, the maximum difference,
    to within the resolution of the measurements, was constant at 6 ppm to 7 ppm.</p>"
