  content: <p>A semi-automated three piston gauge apparatus has been used to measure
    gas species and mode effects in a low pressure pneumatic dead-weight piston gauge.
    Two gases, He and N<sub>2</sub>, were used in both gauge and absolute modes, as
    well as several "intermediate" modes, to characterize a single gauge. The results
    of the measurements are compared with a model for crevice effects that incorporates
    both molecular and viscous flow regimes. The model has previously been applied
    to spin decay rate measurements on the four gases He, N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>
    and SF<sub>6</sub>, and has now been extended to account for differences in effective
    area arising from species changes. Mode effects remain that cannot be predicted
    by the model.</p>
