  content: "<p>The effective areas of two transfer standards were determined from
    cross-floating experiments. It was possible to reproduce the ratio of the effective
    areas of the primary standards using data obtained for the transfer standards
    within 1,6 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, but for the absolute effective area values of the
    transfer standards, relative differences up to 11,6 × 10<sup>-6</sup> were measured.
    Additional dimensional measurements were performed to discover the reason for
    the disagreement. It seems likely that this is due to problems in performing sufficiently
    accurate dimensional measurements.</p>"
