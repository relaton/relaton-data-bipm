  content: "<p>The FRS4 pressure balance, or piston gauge, extends the range of this
    type of instrument below the usual minimum of 1,5 kPa. It gives 0,001 Pa resolution
    from 0,000 Pa to 1 kPa and 0,01 Pa to 3,2 kPa. This is achieved using a piston
    with an effective area of 100 cm<sup>2</sup>. A novel mechanism holds the piston
    centrally in the cylinder without friction and without the necessity of rotation.
    The piston assembly is mounted on an electronic balance giving direct continuous
    readout in pascals. Calibration is by direct measurement to calculate effective
    area and by standard certified weights to characterize the electronic balance.
    The uncertainty is ± 0,002 Pa ± 0,003% of reading from 0,000 Pa to 1 009,999 Pa,
    and ± 0,01 Pa ± 0,003% of reading from 1 010,00 Pa to 3 200,00 Pa.</p>"
