  content: "<p>A brief historical review, beginning from the first half of the nineteenth
    century, illustrates the fundamental steps in the development of piston gauges
    for precise pressure measurements, which were stimulated by the growth of the
    steam industry and, generally, by hydraulic applications. The main different operational
    principles and methods for piston gauge characterization are reviewed and the
    state of the art is discussed from the standpoint of the achievement of the lowest
    possible measurement uncertainty. An analysis is made of the principal current
    research problems which are: (i) accurate determination of the effective area
    of piston-cylinder units at pressures up to several gigapascals; (ii) elastic
    distortion of piston-cylinder units as a function of applied pressure. This analysis
    may be a basis for future research work, with a view to acquiring better knowledge
    of the parameters which limit the accuracy of pressure measurements. Possibilities
    for the use of modern piston gauges in liquid media to pressures of gigapascal
    order are summarized.</p>"
