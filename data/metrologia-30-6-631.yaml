  content: "<p>An analytic approach, based on thin-wall theory, to the analysis of
    simple piston-cylinder systems is presented. The deformation of the cylinder,
    the pressure profile in the gap between the piston and the cylinder and the flow
    of oil are determined. The theory is extended further to calculate the effective
    areas of both the simple and the controlled clearance piston-cylinder systems,
    taking into account the distortion of the piston. The application of this work
    to thick-walled systems is discussed.</p>"
