abstract:
- content: "<p>Variations in the effective area of a pressure balance due to the cylinder
    mounting were listed as one of the influence quantities in the EUROMET Project
    220 on pressure balance uncertainties. As there were very few data on this subject,
    some experiments on two Desgranges &amp; Huot (DH) type 5200 pressure balances
    were carried out in the Centre for Metrology and Accreditation in Finland. The
    nominal areas of the two DH piston-cylinder assemblies used in the tests were
    98 mm<sup>2</sup>. One of them was taken as the standard and the other as the
    subject under test. The mounting torque of the standard was kept constant and
    that on the test assembly was varied from 0 Nm to 8 Nm. The effective area of
    the test assembly, determined by an ordinary cross-floating method, shows a small
    increase with increasing torque, the maximum increase in the area being approximately
    2 parts per million at the torque value of 8 Nm. The result is, of course, valid
    for this particular case only, but it obviously shows the order of magnitude for
    the torque effect. The cylinder mounting, according to the instructions given
    in the DH type 5200 balance manual, typically results in a torque value between
    0 Nm and 4 Nm.</p>"
