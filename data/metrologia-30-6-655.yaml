abstract:
- content: "<p>Pressure balances are generally calibrated by the cross-floating technique,
    where the forces acting on two similar devices in hydrostatic equilibrium are
    compared. It is a skilled and time-consuming process which has not previously
    lent itself to significant automation; computers have mostly been used only to
    calculate results after measurements have been taken. The objective of the present
    work was to develop real-time computerized measurement techniques to ease the
    calibration task, which would fully integrate into a single package with versatile
    software for calculating and displaying results. The calibration process is now
    conducted by studying graphical computer displays which derive their inputs from
    differential-pressure transducers and capacitance or optical displacement sensors.
    The mass imbalance between oil-operated pressure balances is calculated by interpolating
    between changes in piston rate-of-fall. Differential-pressure transducers are
    used to estimate mass imbalances between gas-operated balances, and a quick in
    situ method for determining their sensitivity has been developed. The new techniques
    have been successfully applied to a variety of pressure balance designs and substantial
    reductions in calibration times have been achieved. Reduced levels of scatter
    have revealed small systematic differences between gauge and absolute modes of
    operation.</p>"
