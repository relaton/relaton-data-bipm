  content: "<p>Pressure balances are generally calibrated by the cross-floating technique,
    where the forces acting on two similar devices in hydrostatic equilibrium are
    compared. It is a skilled and time-consuming process which has not previously
    lent itself to significant automation; computers have mostly been used only to
    calculate results after measurements have been taken. The objective of the present
    work was to develop real-time computerized measurement techniques to ease the
    calibration task, which would fully integrate into a single package with versatile
    software for calculating and displaying results. The calibration process is now
    conducted by studying graphical computer displays which derive their inputs from
    differential-pressure transducers and capacitance or optical displacement sensors.
    The mass imbalance between <italic>oil-operated</italic> pressure balances is
    calculated by interpolating between changes in piston rate-of-fall. Differential-pressure
    transducers are used to estimate mass imbalances between <italic>gas-operated</italic>
    balances, and a quick <italic>in situ</italic> method for determining their sensitivity
    has been developed. The new techniques have been successfully applied to a variety
    of pressure balance designs and substantial reductions in calibration times have
    been achieved. Reduced levels of scatter have revealed small systematic differences
    between gauge and absolute modes of operation.</p>"
