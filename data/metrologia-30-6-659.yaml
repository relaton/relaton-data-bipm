  content: "<p>In the metrological as well as in the practical sense, important fundamental
    differences exist between primary and secondary pressure standards. Working with
    the force measuring aspect of piston-cylinder type primary pressure standards
    has allowed the development of a digital readout pressure balance. Following recent
    evaluations, this new instrument has proven specifications that compare very favourably
    with those of the best traditional pressure balances.</p>"
