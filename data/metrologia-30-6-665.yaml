abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on a comparison of the high-accuracy determinations known, the
    most probable estimate of the value of the mercury density at 20 °C and 101 kPa
    is 13 545,850 kg m<sup>-3</sup>. However, the relevant individual measurement
    results differ by relative amounts of up to 3 × 10<sup>-6</sup> from one another,
    so exceeding the uncertainties of 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup> stated by the investigators.
    The potential causes of these deviations are discussed, and the uncertainty of
    the above value is estimated. As regards the thermal expansion and the compressibility
    of mercury, the measurement results published to date are compared, and the most
    probable values are estimated.</p>"
