abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Isothermal variation of pressure with time (at constant volume) for
    the initial pressure range 0,3 GPa to 1,1 GPa and variation of volume with time
    (at constant pressure) for the same pressure range, for commercially available
    pure castor oil, are presented. The phase transition aspects of the large decreases
    of pressure in the first of these variations and about 2% decrease of volume in
    the second, appearing after about twelve hours (or more), are briefly discussed.
    The variation of pressure with volume at constant room temperature for castor
    oil in its normal (isotropic) state and in its high-pressure phase, together with
    some of the metrological consequences of the phenomena observed, are also discussed.</p>"
