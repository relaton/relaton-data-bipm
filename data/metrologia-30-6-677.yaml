abstract:
- content: "<p>Calibration laboratories prefer to use piston manometers (dead-weight
    testers) for calibrating pressures in the range from a few pascals up to 1 000
    MPa. The high-precision pressure transducer P31AP is an alternative that can be
    calibrated as a secondary pressure standard and used as a reference pressure transducer.
    When using reference pressure transducers a simple manual or motor-driven pressure
    source should be available. The test pressure has no longer to be produced precisely
    as the actual pressure value can be measured by the reference pressure transducer
    at any time. Therefore there is nothing to prevent complete computer-controlled
    calibration of pressure transducers.</p>"
