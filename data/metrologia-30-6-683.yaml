abstract:
- content: "<p>A strain-gauge pressure transducer for hydrostatic pressure measurements
    up to 0,5 GPa with a free ceramic rod (or thick-walled cylinder) element in which
    pressure acts on the ends is presented. The operating principle and main metrological
    properties of the device are also described.</p>"
