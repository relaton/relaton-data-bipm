  content: "<p>A new manganin pressure gauge which has managanin wire of 0,12 mm diameter
    wound non-inductively on a newly designed bobbin was successfully temperature-seasoned
    at 140 °C for 48 hours under a controlled atmosphere of nitrogen and pressure-seasoned
    up to 1,4 GPa, and then tested at pressures of up to 1 GPa. From an analysis of
    the measured data by the least-squares method, the relationship between pressure
    and the electrical resistance was obtained as R<sub>p</sub> = R<sub>0</sub>[1
    + 2,558 3 × 10<sup>-5</sup> <italic>P</italic>/Pa - 1,97 × 10<sup>-10</sup>(<italic>P</italic>/Pa)<sup>2</sup>]
    where <italic>P</italic> represents pressure and <italic>R</italic> resistance.
    The maximum error of the gauge was found to be 0,12 MPa at 800 MPa, which corresponds
    to 0,012% of the full span, and the standard deviation of the residuals was 0,02
    MPa. The atmospheric pressure resistance showed very little variation, less than
    0,1 MPa. From these results it is proposed that the gauge can be used as a high-pressure
    transfer gauge for the intercomparison of built-in-high-pressure standards.</p>"
