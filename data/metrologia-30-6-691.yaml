abstract:
- content: "<p>A pressure transducer of a new type and operating to a maximum pressure
    of 1 GPa is described and its main metrological characteristics are given. This
    pressure transducer is of the free cylinder type; the strains on the cylindrical
    surface are detected by strain gauges bonded circumferentially and longitudinally
    to the active cylinder.</p>"
