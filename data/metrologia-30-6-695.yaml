  content: "<p>The possibility of using the optical properties of semiconductors for
    high-pressure calibration is discussed. Quantum-well luminescence and absorption
    are shown to be useful for measuring pressures up to 5 GPa and possibly up to
    10 GPa. Other candidates for optical calibrants like laser-diode emission or the
    sharp lines from modulation spectroscopy are briefly outlined. The semiconductor
    optical pressure sensors are superior to electrical sensors above 2 GPa because
    of their small size and the lack of electrical connections. They are over an order
    of magnitude more sensitive than the ruby gauge, but they work in a much lower
    pressure range.</p>"
