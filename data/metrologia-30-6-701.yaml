  content: "<p>The intercomparison is the best tool for the evaluation of the quality
    of a standard, and the validity of the estimation of its uncertainty. It is also
    the only way to detect possible systematic errors, experimental errors, missing
    items in the uncertainty budget or mistakes in calculation. Since 1975, many intercomparisons
    have been organized in the whole pressure range, all over the world. It would
    be a very large and difficult task to list them. Only the most significant are
    given as examples. The most recent are presented in other papers at this seminar.
    A review of the most commonly used transfer standards and their characteristics
    is given. The more significant data obtained from the intercomparisons (technical
    data and direct exchanges) are analysed.</p>"
