abstract:
- content: "<p>Results are summarized from thirteen laboratories which took part in
    the first four phases of an international intercomparison of pressure measurement
    standards in the range 10 kPa to 140 kPa, carried out under the auspices of the
    BIPM. The transfer standard was a gas-operated pressure balance (piston gauge).
    All participants took measurements in the absolute mode; several also took measurements
    in the gauge mode. The transfer standard showed good repeatability and long-term
    stability, and revealed some unexpected and significant differences between some
    of the participants.</p>"
