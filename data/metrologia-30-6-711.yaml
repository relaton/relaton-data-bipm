  content: "<p>An intercomparison between the primary pressure balance of the LNE
    and a mercury manometer developed at the All-Russian Research Institute for Physical,
    Technical and Radio-Technical Measurements (VNIIFTRI) for purposes of temperature
    measurement was undertaken in 1990. A short description of the two standards is
    given. The transfer standard was a pressure balance equipped with a piston-cylinder
    assembly that has the same characteristics as the standard of the Laboratoire
    National d'Essais (LNE). The results obtained from 30 kPa to 110 kPa showed a
    systematic relative difference of 12 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> between the two standards.
    This difference is significant, as the combined relative uncertainty at 1 Ïƒ level
    is estimated to be 4,2 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>. These results are analysed in
    this paper.</p>"
