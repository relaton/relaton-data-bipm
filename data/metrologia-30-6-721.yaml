abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the intercomparison decided upon by the CCM High Pressure
    Working Group in the pressure range 100 MPa to 700 MPa, an intercomparison has
    been carried out in the Western European countries. This paper gives the general
    results of the work. The standards intercompared were piston pressure balances
    of different types or pressure multipliers. The claimed relative uncertainties
    at the 1 standard deviation level were between 11 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and 93 × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    at 100 MPa, and between 27 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and 216 × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 700
    MPa. Demonstrating a very good agreement, the observed relative differences of
    the measured pressures were inside ± 50 × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 100 MPa and ± 170
    × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 700 MPa.</p>"
