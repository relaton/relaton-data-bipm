abstract:
- content: "<p>Following the advent of the BIPM Recommendation of 1981 and the ISO
    Guide of 1993, it should be possible to achieve much greater consistency in the
    ways in which the measurement uncertainties of pressure standards are evaluated
    and expressed. These documents divide uncertainty contributions into two groups,
    type A (random) and type B (others). The method of evaluating and combining uncertainty
    contributions is illustrated by two examples - a U-tube manometer and a pressure
    balance (piston gauge). In both cases the uncertainty contributions are subdivided
    into two further groups - those which are independent of the applied pressure
    and those which are proportional to it.</p>"
