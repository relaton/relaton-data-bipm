abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the ANSI MC88.1-1972 standard A Guide for the Dynamic
    Calibration of Pressure Transducers, the properties to be determined when calibrating
    a dynamic pressure transducer are sensitivity, amplitude as a function of frequency,
    phase as a function of frequency, resonant frequency, damping ratio, rise time
    and overshoot. A static calibration yields only the sensitivity. The properties
    of dynamic pressure transducers and various methods for determining them are reviewed.</p>"
