  content: "<p>According to the ANSI MC88.1-1972 standard <italic>A Guide for the
    Dynamic Calibration of Pressure Transducers</italic>, the properties to be determined
    when calibrating a dynamic pressure transducer are sensitivity, amplitude as a
    function of frequency, phase as a function of frequency, resonant frequency, damping
    ratio, rise time and overshoot. A static calibration yields only the sensitivity.
    The properties of dynamic pressure transducers and various methods for determining
    them are reviewed.</p>"
