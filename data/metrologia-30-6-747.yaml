abstract:
- content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a
    primary standard for the measurement of dynamic pressure and temperature. Our
    method requires a dynamic source and a technique for calibrating it. The source
    is a shock tube; the calibration technique is based on the properties of diatomic
    gas molecules measured by laser spectroscopic methods.</p>"
