  content: "<p>After the CCM Medium Pressure Working Group intercomparison indicated
    that the SMU primary mercury manometer differed by more than 20 ppm from other
    national standards, attention was paid to determining and eliminating the possible
    sources of these deviations. These efforts included replacing or redesigning some
    of the manometer components. The modified manometer design is presented in this
    paper. A piston gauge has been calibrated in the absolute mode using nitrogen
    as a pressure media, with the primary standard manometers at four national standards
    laboratories: Slovenský Metrologický Ústav (SMU), Bratislava; Amt für Standardisierung,
    Messwesen und Warenprüfung (ASMW), Berlin; Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB), Braunschweig; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
    Gaithersburg; over a period of six years. Each of these manometers is of a different
    design. This has provided a basis from which to determine how the design changes
    affect the SMU manometer performance. The results indicate that the previous systematic
    deviations have been eliminated in the upper pressure ranges. The results for
    all four manometers agree to within their claimed uncertainties, however at the
    lowest pressures significant differences still exist and require further investigation.</p>"
