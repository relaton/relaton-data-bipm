- content: "<p>The Comité Consultatif pour la Masse et les Grandeurs Apparentées (CCM),
    through its High Pressure and Medium Pressure Working Groups, organized this Second
    International Seminar on Pressure Metrology from 1 kPa to 1 GPa, which was held
    at the Laboratoire National d'Essais (LNE), Paris, France, from 2 to 4 June 1993.</p><p>The
    scope of the seminar was to review the state of the art of pressure measurements
    in the 1 kPa to I GPa pressure range and to present innovative contributions by
    standards laboratories, universities and industry. The seminar was organized in
    six sessions: liquid-column manometers; piston gauge pressure standards; properties
    of liquids and gases relevant to pressure metrology; pressure transducers and
    transfer standards; pressure standard comparison (methods and results); dynamic
    pressure measurements.</p><p>Each session opened with the presentation of a review
    paper on major requirements in that field and, at the end of the seminar, a general
    discussion was organized on the actual limits of accuracy of static and dynamic
    pressure measurements in fluid media, and the fundamental problems in pressure
    metrology between 1 kPa and 1 GPa.</p><p>The seminar was attended by sixty scientists
    from twenty-four countries, all working in the field of pressure measurements.
    Forty-nine papers were presented. The participation of scientists from so many
    countries indicates the importance of pressure metrology from the scientific and
    industrial points of view. Most papers were presented by scientists from national
    standards laboratories, with eight papers from universities and four from industry.</p><p>Eleven
    papers reported the results of cooperative work involving metrological institutions
    dealing with high pressure, generally national standards laboratories, an indication
    that scientific links are already well established at this level. Links are also
    strengthening between industry and standards laboratories. Although industrial
    participation at the seminar was relatively small, it was at a high level.</p><p>This
    special issue of  Metrologia brings together all the seminar papers accepted for
    publication after a careful review process controlled directly by the organizing
    committee of the seminar and the  Metrologia editor.</p><p>I feel that we have
    succeeded reasonably well. The papers published here focus on important achievements
    in pressure measurements and the main problems which the scientific community
    is working to resolve in the future. Various achievements are reported, ranging
    from a general improvement in accuracy to new devices and techniques.</p><p>I
    would like to thank all those who helped with this seminar. First, the members
    of the organizing committee: Chairman of the CCM Medium Pressure Work ing Group,
    P Stuart, (NPL, UK); J Bonhoure (BIPM); V Borovkov (VNIIFTRI, Russia); C Ehrlich
    (NIST, USA); J Jager (PTB, Germany); J C Legras (LNE); Chairman of the CCM Low
    Pressure Working Group, C Tilford (NIST, USA); S Yamamoto (NRLM, Japan); R Wirniewski
    (WUT, Poland); not forgetting the institutions that allowed them to spend considerable
    time on the preparation and organization of the seminar. I extend my thanks to
    V E Bean (NIST, USA), A Ooiwa (NRLM, Japan), and A J Rostocki (WUT, Poland), who
    joined the organizing committee as guest editors and helped to see the papers
    presented at the seminar through the review process and into print.</p><p>Many
    thanks are also due to A Bryden, Director of the Laboratoire National d'Essais,
    and to J C Legras of the LNE Pressure Laboratory, for hosting the seminar and
    for taking care of all practical problems. A special thanks to T J Quinn, Director
    of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, for his continuous support and
    encouragement in the preparation of the seminar.</p><p>Grateful thanks to Desgranges
    et Huot, France, for their hospitality in Paris; and to D-H Instruments Co., USA,
    and Ruska Co., USA, which sponsored the seminar through their fmancial support
    for the publication of these Proceedings.</p><p>A special mention must be made
    of D Blackburn,  Metrologia editor, his assistant C Lawrence, and the administrative
    staff of the BIPM, for their valuable contribution.</p><p>Last but not least,
    thanks to all participants who, through their work, have given us the opportunity
    to present the state of the art in pressure measurements and to evaluate future
    requirements. This experience will surely be repeated. Such international contacts
    inspire the dream of a better world where science and technology are at the service
    of humanity.</p>"
