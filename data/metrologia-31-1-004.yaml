abstract:
- content: "<p>Samples of Pt-10% Ir have been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
    (XPS) to assess environmental contamination of reference kilogram masses. Samples
    were sputtered clean and distributed to four places where reference kilograms
    are kept at the NPL. All four specimens showed carbon and oxygen contamination
    which will be reported elsewhere in detail. All four specimens additionally showed
    mercury contamination, with levels that varied from venue to venue. Of all metals,
    mercury has the highest vapour pressure, is commonly used in laboratories and
    reacts with platinum; with hindsight our results are not surprising. The most
    contaminating venue studied, leading to an effective mass increase of a reference
    kilogram due to mercury of 0,26 Î¼g/day, was the case enclosing the UK primary
    balance. The mercury is not removed by washing or by scrubbing with a chamois
    leather soaked in ethanol and ether. The mercury level is therefore probably stable
    after a period following manufacture, unless the mass is exposed to a venue with
    a higher mercury level than previously. Similar studies with stainless steels
    showed no effect. This problem is, therefore, probably confined to the Pt and
    Pt-Ir masses only. We recommend that in relation to Pt or Pt-Ir masses (i) all
    equipment containing mercury be removed from weighing laboratories, (ii) venues
    be monitored for mercury by XPS, and (iii) further work be done to determine whether
    best mass stability would be achieved by controlled mercury saturation after the
    reference mass is made, or by storage in a rigorously contaminant-free environment.</p>"
