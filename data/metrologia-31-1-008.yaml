abstract:
- content: "<p>A mercury triple point apparatus has been developed which permits the
    observation of long freezes and melts with little intervention. We have developed
    a sealed glass cell containing 2,5 kg of mercury which was filled simply by pouring
    rather than by vaccum distillation. The cell is installed in a temperature-controlled
    bath of our own design. Melting plateaux of more than 24 hours duration are recorded
    with the bath setpoint approximately 3 Â°C higher than the mercury triple point
    temperature. Much longer plateaux are possible by setting the bath closer to the
    triple point temperature. The temperature of the triple point of mercury has been
    determined as 234,308 5 K on the IPTS-68 with a standard deviation of 0,1 mK based
    on measurements with five platinum resistance thermometers. The result is in excellent
    agreement with the values 234,308 3 K and 234,308 6 K as determined at the NIST
    (formerly the NBS, USA) by Furukawa and Bigge and at the NPL (UK) by Chattle and
    Butler, respectively. A platinum resistance thermometer tracks the hydrostatic
    gradient within the cell over a distance of 10 cm and is in agreement with the
    value of 7,1 mK per metre of liquid as given in the texts of the IPTS-68 and the
    ITS-90. The measurements yield a value of 234,315 9 K on the ITS-90 for the triple
    point of mercury cell investigated.</p>"
