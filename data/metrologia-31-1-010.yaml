abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of resistance ratios (W) for platinum resistance thermometers
    was obtained at the triple point of Hg and the melting point of Ga in order to
    study their relationship. It was found that using measured values for one of the
    fixed points, a linear equation will predict the value of the other. These measurements
    also indicate that the fixed points of Hg and of Ga are inconsistent by about
    1,5 mK in the sense that either the melting point of Ga or the triple point of
    Hg was assigned too high a value on the ITS-90.</p>"
