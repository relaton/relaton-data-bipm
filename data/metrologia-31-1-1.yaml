abstract:
- content: <p>Directly comparing the "mechanical" with the "electrical" joule by the
    levitated mass method implies accurately measuring the vertical displacement of
    the centre of gravity of a levitated superconducting body. The required accuracy
    of some parts in 10<sup>9</sup> over relatively small displacements of a few millimetres
    when the stability of a standard mass is to be monitored, and the special conditions
    under which the measurements must be made, pose a number of specific problems.
    The principles of the D. I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology measurements system
    are discussed. Estimates of the potential of the system, based upon some preliminary
    results, are presented.</p>
