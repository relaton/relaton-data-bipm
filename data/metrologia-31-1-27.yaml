abstract:
- content: "<p>A new interpolation equation for the calibration of infrared pyrometers
    was derived by using the reference wavelength method. The errors associated with
    the new interpolation equation were calculated by comparing the temperature scale
    based on the interpolation equations with that determined by the fundamental method
    based on Planck's radiation law. To assess the usefulness of the new interpolation
    equation, the errors were compared with those associated with the interpolation
    equation previously used which was derived by the effective wavelength method.
    We find that the new interpolation equation can interpolate and extrapolate the
    temperature scale of an infrared pyrometer calibrated by the multiple-point-calibration
    method with small error over a wide temperature range. The equation is especially
    useful for the calibration of infrared pyrometers, when making measurements at
    low temperatures (&lt; 600 Â°C) with the response band in the long-wavelength infrared
    region.</p>"
