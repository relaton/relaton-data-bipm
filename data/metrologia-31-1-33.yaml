  content: "<p>A comparison of the frequencies of stabilized He-Ne/<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    lasers at Î»=633 nm in Helsinki (Finland) is reported. This comparison involved
    two lasers from the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (Russian Federation)
    and the Technical Inspection Centre (Finland). The frequency difference between
    laser radiations is 2,8 kHz with a standard uncertainty of 3,4 kHz.</p>"
