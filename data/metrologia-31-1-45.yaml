- content: "<p>Comparisons of the Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) were made with those of the Swiss Federal Office of
    Metrology (OFM), Wabern, Switzerland, in November 1992 and of the Nederlands Meetinstituut-Van
    Swinden Laboratorium (NMi), Delft, the Netherlands, in March 1993. Direct and
    indirect comparison results indicate agreement between the voltage standards to
    within 1 nV.</p>"
