  content: "<p>A set of resistance ratios (<italic>W</italic>) for platinum resistance
    thermometers was obtained at the triple point of Hg and the melting point of Ga
    in order to study their relationship. It was found that using measured values
    for one of the fixed points, a linear equation will predict the value of the other.
    These measurements also indicate that the fixed points of Hg and of Ga are inconsistent
    by about 1,5 mK in the sense that either the melting point of Ga or the triple
    point of Hg was assigned too high a value on the ITS-90.</p>"
