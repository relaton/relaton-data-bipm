- content: "<p>Summer School, 27 June to 8 July 1994, Viana do Castelo, Hotel do Parque,
    Portugal</p><p>Optical fibres, with their extremely low transmission loss, untapped
    bandwidth and controllable dispersion, dominate a broad range of technologies
    in which applications must respond to the increasing constraints of today's specifications
    as well as envisage future requirements.</p><p>Optical fibres dominate communications
    systems. In the area of sensors, fibre optics will be fully exploited for their
    immunity to EMI, their high sensitivity and their large dynamic range.</p><p>The
    maturity of single mode optical technology has led to intensive R&amp;D of a range
    of components based on the advantages of transmission characteristics and signal
    processing.</p><p>Specifications and intercompatibility requests for the new generation
    of both analogue and digital fibre optical components and systems has created
    a demand for sophisticated measuring techniques based on unique and complex instruments.</p><p>In
    recent years there has been a signification evolution in response to the explosion
    of applications and the tightening of specifications. These developments justify
    a concerted effort to focus on trends in optical fibre metrology and standards.</p><p>Objective</p><p>The
    objective of this school is to provide a progressive and comprehensive presentation
    of current issues concerning passive and active optical fibre characterization
    and measurement techniques. Passive fibre components support a variety of developments
    in optical fibre systems and will be discussed in terms of relevance and standards.
    Particular attention will be paid to devices for metrological purposes such as
    reference fibres and calibration artefacts.</p><p>The characterization and testing
    of optical fibre amplifiers, which have great potential in telecommunications,
    data distribution networks and as a system part in instrumentation, will be covered.</p><p>Methods
    of measurement and means of calibration with traceability will be discussed, together
    with the characterization requirements of the new generation of analogue and digital
    fibre optical systems, which require sophisticated measurement techniques employing
    complex instruments unique to optical measurements.</p><p>The school will foster
    and enhance the interaction between material, devices, systems, and standards-oriented
    R&amp;D communities, as well as between engineers concerned with design and manufacturers
    of systems and instrumentation.</p><p>Topics</p><p><list list-type=\"ordered\"><list-item><p>Review
