    <p><bold>17 to 21 October 1994, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre</bold></p>
    <p>The International Laboratory Accreditation Conference (ILAC) is an informal international forum for discussion of issues related to laboratory accreditation. Conferences are held biennially at different locations around the world, and the 1994 conference will be held in Hong Kong from 17 to 21 October. Some three hundred delegates from forty countries are expected.</p>
    <p>ILAC was established in 1977 by the heads of several national testing authorities. Its objectives are:
     <list list-type="ordered">
     <list-item><p>to promote the exchange and dissemination of information and ideas on laboratory accreditation systems and other arrangements for assessing the quality of test results;</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>to facilitate and encourage the international acceptance of laboratory test and calibration results, inter alia, through bilateral and multilateral recognition of laboratory accreditation systems; and</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>to co-operate and collaborate with international organizations on matters relating to laboratory accreditation and other testing arrangements.</p></list-item>
    </list></p>
    <p><bold>Registration</bold></p>
    <p>It is expected that the Hong Kong conference will be at least as popular as recent conferences in Ottawa (1992), Turin (1990) and Auckland (1988), so early registration is advisable. For further details write to the ILAC Secretariat, c/o 36th Floor, Immigration Tower, 7 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong, or fax (852) 824 1302.</p>
