abstract:
- content: "<p>We have extended the new TA2 post-processed time scale at the NIST
    beyond our previous reports to include all of the period from January 1984 to
    December 1992. Derived from the ensemble of clocks at the NIST, this time scale
    includes the benefits of several recent refinements to the algorithm. By iteratively
    running the algorithm on the ensemble clock data and characterizing anomalous
    behaviour in the dominant individual clocks of the ensemble between iterations,
    we obtain an optimized scale which benefits from the informed anticipation of
    that anomalous behaviour and demonstrates an overall decrease in scale disruption.
    Herein we discuss changes to the TA2 algorithm that we made while processing the
    eight-year run, our method of characterizing anomalous behaviour in individual
    clocks, the way unanticipated anomalous behaviour is dealt with by the algorithm,
    and our resulting nine-year time scale.</p>"
