abstract:
- content: "<p>Experimental results indicate that  R<sub>o</sub>, the resistance of
    a platinum resistance thermometer at the triple point of water, is a logarithmic
    function of the cooling rate following high-temperature use of the thermometer.
    It is also shown that annealing at a constant cooling rate from the maximum temperature
    is a more efficient use of annealing time than soaking at constant temperatures
    between  T<sub>max</sub> and 450 Â°C.</p>"
