abstract:
- content: "<p>Adsorption layers on stainless steel mass standards (OIML classes E1
    and E2) have been determined directly and precisely by the optical method of ellipsometry
    as a function of relative humidity in the range 0,03 ⩽ h ⩽ 0,77, the relevant
    influencing factors being surface cleanliness, roughness, steel composition and
    ambient temperature. Under the same environmental conditions, two pairs of 1 kg
    artefacts, having geometrical surfaces differing in area by about δ A = 390 cm<sup>2</sup>,
    but the same material properties and surface finish as the mass standards, have
    been compared on a 1 kg mass comparator. The two independent measuring techniques
    yield strongly correlated results, the standard uncertainties of the measured
    surface coverings being &lt;or=0,005 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>. The sorption behaviour
    of carefully polished surfaces (average peak-to-valley height R<sub>z</sub> ⩽
    0,12 μm) is well described by the BET equation for multilayer adsorption, the
    adsorption isotherm being of type II according to the BET classification. For
    clean, well-polished surfaces the BET parameters μ<sub>m</sub> = 0,008 4 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>
    and c<sub>B</sub> = 8,9 were found; the corresponding coefficient in the limited
    humidity range 0,30 ⩽ h ⩽ 0,60 is 31 × δh ng cm<sup>-2</sup>. The sorption behaviour
    of precision stainless steel mass standards is mainly influenced by the degree
    of surface cleanliness: uncleaned standards with an absolute surface covering
    of μ' ⩾ 0,7 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> show sorption-induced mass variations which are
    greater by about a factor of 2,5 relative to the clean surfaces.</p>"
