  content: "<p>Adsorption layers on stainless steel mass standards (OIML classes E1
    and E2) have been determined directly and precisely by the optical method of ellipsometry
    as a function of relative humidity in the range 0,03 ⩽ <italic>h</italic> ⩽ 0,77,
    the relevant influencing factors being surface cleanliness, roughness, steel composition
    and ambient temperature. Under the same environmental conditions, two pairs of
    1 kg artefacts, having geometrical surfaces differing in area by about δ <italic>A</italic>
    = 390 cm<sup>2</sup>, but the same material properties and surface finish as the
    mass standards, have been compared on a 1 kg mass comparator. The two independent
    measuring techniques yield strongly correlated results, the standard uncertainties
    of the measured surface coverings being &lt;or=0,005 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>. The sorption
    behaviour of carefully polished surfaces (average peak-to-valley height <italic>R</italic><sub>z</sub>
    ⩽ 0,12 μm) is well described by the BET equation for multilayer adsorption, the
    adsorption isotherm being of type II according to the BET classification. For
    clean, well-polished surfaces the BET parameters μ<sub>m</sub> = 0,008 4 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>
    and <italic>c</italic><sub>B</sub> = 8,9 were found; the corresponding coefficient
    in the limited humidity range 0,30 ⩽ <italic>h</italic> ⩽ 0,60 is 31 × δ<italic>h</italic>
    ng cm<sup>-2</sup>. The sorption behaviour of precision stainless steel mass standards
    is mainly influenced by the degree of surface cleanliness: uncleaned standards
    with an absolute surface covering of μ' ⩾ 0,7 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> show sorption-induced
    mass variations which are greater by about a factor of 2,5 relative to the clean
    surfaces.</p>"
