abstract:
- content: "<p>Using the two independent measuring techniques, mass comparison and
    ellipsometry, described in Part I, adsorption layers on stainless steel mass standards
    and artefacts of nominal value 1 kg have been determined directly and precisely
    as a function of pressure in the range 5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa ⩽ p ⩽ 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>
    Pa. For clean, polished surfaces (average peak-to-valley height R<sub>z</sub>
    ⩽ 0,12 μm) reversible sorption isotherms with a coefficient of (0,024 ± 0,005)
    μg cm<sup>-2</sup> were found due to the transition from normal pressure (relative
    humidity h = 0,03) to the pressure of 0,1 Pa. For uncleaned surfaces this coefficient
    rises by a factor of about 2,5. At pressures below 0,1 Pa irreversible adsorption
    was observed with a constant adsorption rate of about 0,012 μg cm<sup>-2</sup>
    d<sup>-1</sup>, independent of the surface cleanliness. This sorption effect is
    attributed to continuous condensation of oil particles originating from the turbomolecular
    pump used.</p>"
