  content: "<p>Using the two independent measuring techniques, mass comparison and
    ellipsometry, described in Part I, adsorption layers on stainless steel mass standards
    and artefacts of nominal value 1 kg have been determined directly and precisely
    as a function of pressure in the range 5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa ⩽ <italic>p</italic>
    ⩽ 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> Pa. For clean, polished surfaces (average peak-to-valley
    height <italic>R</italic><sub>z</sub> ⩽ 0,12 μm) reversible sorption isotherms
    with a coefficient of (0,024 ± 0,005) μg cm<sup>-2</sup> were found due to the
    transition from normal pressure (relative humidity <italic>h</italic> = 0,03)
    to the pressure of 0,1 Pa. For uncleaned surfaces this coefficient rises by a
    factor of about 2,5. At pressures below 0,1 Pa irreversible adsorption was observed
    with a constant adsorption rate of about 0,012 μg cm<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>,
    independent of the surface cleanliness. This sorption effect is attributed to
    continuous condensation of oil particles originating from the turbomolecular pump
    used.</p>"
