  content: "<p>A new concept for the standardization structure of long-distance measurements
    is proposed. It is based on using absolute laser interferometry for transfer of
    the length unit to a base-line of 1 km length. The use of an evacuated interference
    base-line makes it possible to create a standard base-line of the highest accuracy,
    reliably connected with the common frequency-time-length standard. The base-line
    length may be extended by means of precise two-wavelength optical range finders
    correcting for the atmospheric index of refraction.</p>"
