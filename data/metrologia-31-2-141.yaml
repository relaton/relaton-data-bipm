  content: "<p>Five transportable Zener-diode dc voltage standards have been developed,
    fabricated and investigated at the NPO VNIIFTRI. The standards were designed to
    transfer the unit of electromotive force (emf) from Josephson reference standards
    to measuring instruments. Following the results of these investigations, standard
    N 02 has been used for intercomparison of the Russian Josephson reference standards.</p>"
