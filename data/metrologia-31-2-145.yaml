  content: "<p>Thermoelectric properties of a new gold/palladium (Au/Pd) thermocouple
    are investigated at the aluminium and silver freezing point cells. The Au/Pd thermocouple
    generates a high thermal emf and the reproducibility is ±0,2 μV at 961,78 °C.
    The immersion characteristics of the Au/Pd thermocouple are found to be superior
    to the conventional type S (Pt-10% Rh/Pt) thermocouple, and it has a larger sensitivity
    than the extensively studied gold-platinum (Au/Pt) thermocouple. Its easy maintenance
    and good thermoelectric properties merit serious consideration as an alternative
    but preferred temperature sensor in the range of 0 °C to 1 000 °C.</p>"
