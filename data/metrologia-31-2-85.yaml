  content: "<p>Experimental results indicate that <italic>R</italic><sub>o</sub>,
    the resistance of a platinum resistance thermometer at the triple point of water,
    is a logarithmic function of the cooling rate following high-temperature use of
    the thermometer. It is also shown that annealing at a constant cooling rate from
    the maximum temperature is a more efficient use of annealing time than soaking
    at constant temperatures between <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> and 450 Â°C.</p>"
