abstract:
- content: <p>A study has been made of the surfaces of Immaculate 5, En58AM and Nimonic
    105 materials by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, (a) after cleaning using simple
    washing methods and (b) after contamination in the laboratory environment for
    periods of up to 156 days, using filtered and unfiltered laboratory air. All surfaces
    are covered by a thin oxide and this is further covered by a thin layer of carbonaceous
    contamination of atmospheric origin. Some of the contamination is removed by surfactants
    contained in various proprietary cleaners or by boiling water (used to mimic steam-cleaning
    methods). The first exposure to boiling water increases the chromium content of
    the oxide. Exposure to the environment causes the carbonaceous contamination thickness
    to grow at a rate described by either simple diffusion theory or by a "logarithmic"
    theory such that the increase in mass of a kilogram artefact is around 15 Î¼g/year
    after five years. If the laboratory air is filtered and moves at a low rate the
    carbonaceous contamination growth is low, but if the filter is removed and the
    flow rate raised, the carbonaceous contamination rate increases. It is recommended
    that masses made from these materials are initially subject to a wash in boiling
    water for 5 minutes to develop a stable oxide thickness, stored in static filtered
    air to reduce the carbonaceous contamination and are cleaned using a dilute aqueous
    solution of gentle surfactant cleaners or possibly by a steam-cleaning method.
    Some further work confirming this by weighing is required.</p>
