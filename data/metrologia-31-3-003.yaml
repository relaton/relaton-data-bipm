abstract:
- content: "<p>It is useful to recall that the (late nineteenth-century) Baltimore
    Lectures of Lord Kelvin indicated that the likely sizes of atomic particles spanned
    almost two decades. Yet in the early years of the present century, Sir William
    Bragg's ansatz, together with the oil-drop e, gave the first reliable estimate
    of the scale of crystal interplanar spacings. The converse process of using an
    XRCD approach to obtain a value for the Avogadro constant was, prior to the advent
    of x-ray interferometry, limited by the need to connect optical and x-ray wavelengths
    before using the latter to estimate unit cell dimensions in crystals. Other limitations
    of these early measurements included the use of water as a density standard and
    the assignment of molar masses to individual specimens based on geochemical abundance
    averages. All these difficulties were overcome, in principle, with the application
    of x-ray/optical interferometry to the determination of lattice periods, the use
    of solid object density standards, and the determination of densities and isotopic
    abundances on individual monocrystalline specimens. While the present-day situation
    is addressed in other contributions to this workshop, the present essay attempts
    to place some of the early work in context and to look also to the future.</p>"
