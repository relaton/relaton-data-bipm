abstract:
- content: "<p>It is now possible to obtain indirect values of the Avogadro constant
    N<sub>A</sub> having comparatively small combined standard uncertainties by appropriately
    combining the values of a number of other fundamental physical constants. These
    constants, whose values in several important cases can be obtained from electrical
    measurements, include the Rydberg, fine-structure, Josephson, von Klitzing, Planck,
    and Faraday constants, the molar mass of the proton, the proton-electron mass
    ratio, and the shielded proton gyromagnetic ratio. This paper gives the expressions
    that relate N<sub>A</sub> to these other fundamental constants and the values
    of N<sub>A</sub> that can be obtained from these expressions using the currently
    available data. It also briefly discusses the prospects of obtaining an indirect
    value of N<sub>A</sub> with a combined standard uncertainty that is small enough
    to allow the redefinition of the kilogram.</p>"
