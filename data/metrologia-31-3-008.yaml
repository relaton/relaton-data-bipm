abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements of silicon crystal density for the determination of the
    Avogadro constant are reviewed. Volume, mass and hydrostatic-weighing measurements
    are considered from the technical standpoints of error sources and uncertainty
    of measurement. The outlook on the possibility of achieving experimental uncertainties
    of less than 10<sup>-7</sup> is described. Attention is paid to the necessity
    of reducing the sources of uncertainty in the density arising from the surface,
    such as silica layers and damaged crystalline layers.</p>"
