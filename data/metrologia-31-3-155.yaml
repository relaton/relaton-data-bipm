abstract:
- content: <p>This special issue of Metrologia brings together contributions to the
    International Workshop on the Avogadro Constant and the Representation of the
    Silicon Mole, held in Turin, Italy, from 9 to 10 March 1994. It was organized
    by the Istituto di Metrologia "G Colonnetti" (IMGC) del Consiglio Nazionale delle
    Ricerche (CNR) and the Istituto di Fisica Generale "A Avogadro" (IFG) dell'Università
    di Tonno. It was sponsored by the CNR, the University of Turin, the Regione Piemonte,
    and the Commission of the European Communities – DG XII.</p><p>The workshop was
    a follow-up to previous international meetings held in Turin to commemorate Amedeo
    Avogadro, one in 1911 (the centenary of the publication of his hypothesis) and
    another in 1957 (the centenary of his death). On this occasion the workshop was
    motivated by the requirements of researchers engaged in the international project
    on the determination of the Avogadro constant by the x-ray crystal density method.
    Sixty-four participants representing eight countries attended the workshop. Doctoral
    students in metrology from Turin University and researchers working in adjacent
    fields were also present. The lectures were chosen so as to review the different
    aspects of this project, to illustrate progress in research, and to indicate future
    developments to scientists working in different fields of physics, metrology and
    technology. Complementary approaches to the N<sub>A</sub> determination based
    on electrical measurements were also reported and analysed. During the workshop,
    a number of specialist meetings allowed experts to discuss specific topics, to
    exchange information on results and techniques, and to improve the coordination
    of their activities.</p><p>In their opening addresses, Prof. C Castagnoli (Director
    of the IFG) and Prof. L Crovini (Director of the IMGC) welcomed the participants
    and introduced the work in progress with a view to making a more precise determination
    of the Avogadro constant. They mentioned the expected influence of this work on
    the set of consistent values of the fundamental physical constants and on the
    definition of the mass unit.</p><p>Dr T Quinn, Director of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures, chaired the final discussion, drawing attention to the message
    of the workshop and its contribution to mass metrology.</p><p>Grateful thanks
    are addressed to all lecturers and participants and to the guest editors and reviewers
    of the papers for their contribution to the success of the workshop.</p>
