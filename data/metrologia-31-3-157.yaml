abstract:
- content: '<p>Ladies and Gentlemen</p><p>To quote Mr Jean Terrien: "Physics must
    be one step ahead of metrology". A long-serving Director of the BIPM, he said
    these words when visiting the IMGC in 1970 as a member of the scientific board
    of our Institute.</p><p>At that time it was still an open question whether the
    IMGC should start research work on the absolute measurement of silicon lattice
    spacing. Mr Terrien underlined the revolutionary character of x-ray interferometry
    and, eventually, he caused the balance needle to lean towards the... right direction.
    Mr Terrien correctly foresaw that, like Michelson''s interferometer of 1880, x-ray
    interferometry could have a prominent place in today''s science and technology.
    And while, in the first case, after more than a century we can see instruments
    based on electromagnetic wave interaction within every one''s reach in laboratories
    and, sometimes, in workshops, in the second case, twenty-five years since the
    first development of an x-ray interferometer we can witness its role in nanometrology.</p><p>Today
    and tomorrow we meet to discuss how to go beyond the sixth decimal place in the
    value of the Avogadro constant. We are aware that the quest for this achievement
    requires the cooperation of scientists with complementary capabilities. I am sure
    that the present workshop is a very good opportunity to present and discuss results
    and to improve and extend existing cooperation.</p><p>The new adjustment of fundamental
    constants envisaged by the CODATA Task Group is redoubling scientists'' efforts
    to produce competitive values of N<sub>A</sub>. The results of the measurements
    of the silicon lattice spacing in terms of an optical wavelength, which were available
    for the 1986 adjustment, combined with the determination of silicon molar volume,
    demonstrate how such an N<sub>A</sub> determination produces a consistent set
    of other constants and opens the way to a possible redefinition of the kilogram.</p><p>We
    shall see in these two days how far we have progressed along this road.</p><p>For
    us at the IMGC this is an extremely valuable opportunity to compare our results
    with others using combined x-ray and optical interferometry to measure Si lattice
    spacing and dimensional and mass metrology to determine Si density.</p><p>The
    initial impetus for the organization of this workshop was given by several colleagues,
    and with special emphasis and competence by the late Prof. Peter Seyfried of the
    PTB. We all mourn the loss of such a distinguished scientist to whom very important
    achievements in N<sub>A</sub> determination have to be credited. Prof. Seyfried
    was well known at the IMGC, some of our scientists having very profitably cooperated
    with him and his co-workers—a cooperation that is being steadily carried on.</p><p>I
    wish to acknowledge the endorsements of the Regione Piemonte, of the CNR, of Turin
    University, and of the Commission of the European Communities, in terms of grants
    and other resources without which the workshop could not have been realized.</p><p>I
    also wish to very warmly thank my colleagues on the Organizing Committee who have
    worked so well for this event.</p><p>Lastly, I am pleased to acknowledge the fruitful
    cooperation between the IMGC and the Istituto di Fisica Generale "A Avogadro"—not
    the first case of its kind and, I am convinced, not the last.</p><p>To conclude,
    let me draw your attention to an enlargement of an Italian stamp commemorating
    A Avogadro. The statement reads: "Equal volumes of gas in the same temperature
    and pressure conditions contain the same number of molecules". He simply stated
    the existence of such a number, leaving us with the pleasure of measuring it.</p>'
