  content: <p>The nineteenth-century history of the mole concept, of the determination
    of the Loschmidt number and of the Avogadro constant, is interesting in several
    respects. While Avogadro's hypothesis (1811) played a key role in the development
    of the mole concept, it was only one of the epistemic tools that chemists used
    in their long search for a consistent system of molecular and atomic weights.
    This line of research and thought was fully mature in the 1880s. Following a Laplacian
    programme until the 1880s, physicists tried to guess the range of the so-called
    molecular forces, but the development of the kinetic theory of gases introduced
    a new interest in the determination of the number of "particles" present in gaseous
    systems. In this respect Loschmidt's papers (1865) represented the transition
    between the two types of interest in the molecular reality. However, it was only
    in the first decade of the twentieth century that the theoretical and experimental
    determination of physical quantities directly related to the Avogadro constant
    received full attention by scientists such as Planck, Einstein, Rutherford and
    Perrin.</p>
