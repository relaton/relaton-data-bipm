abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper summarizes the activities of several national metrological
    institutes in replacing the kilogram artefact by the mass of a certain number
    of silicon atoms. This atomic path requires a very precise determination of the
    Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub> with a relative uncertainty of better than 5 Ã—
    10<sup>-8</sup>. At present, the most limiting factors are the variability, from
    sample to sample, of the isotopic abundances and the content of impurities and
    vacancies, and difficulty in the realization of accurate density standards. Recently,
    several improvements in molar mass and density determinations have been made,
    so a further reduction of the level of relative uncertainty towards 10<sup>-7</sup>
    may be expected in the near future. Beyond that, new experimental methods will
    be required.</p>"
