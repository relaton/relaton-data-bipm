  content: "<p>The paper summarizes the activities of several national metrological
    institutes in replacing the kilogram artefact by the mass of a certain number
    of silicon atoms. This atomic path requires a very precise determination of the
    Avogadro constant <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> with a relative uncertainty of
    better than 5 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup>. At present, the most limiting factors are the
    variability, from sample to sample, of the isotopic abundances and the content
    of impurities and vacancies, and difficulty in the realization of accurate density
    standards. Recently, several improvements in molar mass and density determinations
    have been made, so a further reduction of the level of relative uncertainty towards
    10<sup>-7</sup> may be expected in the near future. Beyond that, new experimental
    methods will be required.</p>"
