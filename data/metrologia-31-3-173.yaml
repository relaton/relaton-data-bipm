  content: "<p>It is useful to recall that the (late nineteenth-century) Baltimore
    Lectures of Lord Kelvin indicated that the likely sizes of atomic particles spanned
    almost two decades. Yet in the early years of the present century, Sir William
    Bragg's ansatz, together with the oil-drop <italic>e</italic>, gave the first
    reliable estimate of the scale of crystal interplanar spacings. The converse process
    of using an XRCD approach to obtain a value for the Avogadro constant was, prior
    to the advent of x-ray interferometry, limited by the need to connect optical
    and x-ray wavelengths before using the latter to estimate unit cell dimensions
    in crystals. Other limitations of these early measurements included the use of
    water as a density standard and the assignment of molar masses to individual specimens
    based on geochemical abundance averages. All these difficulties were overcome,
    in principle, with the application of x-ray/optical interferometry to the determination
    of lattice periods, the use of solid object density standards, and the determination
    of densities and isotopic abundances on individual monocrystalline specimens.
    While the present-day situation is addressed in other contributions to this workshop,
    the present essay attempts to place some of the early work in context and to look
    also to the future.</p>"
