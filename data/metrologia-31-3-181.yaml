  content: "<p>It is now possible to obtain indirect values of the Avogadro constant
    <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> having comparatively small combined standard uncertainties
    by appropriately combining the values of a number of other fundamental physical
    constants. These constants, whose values in several important cases can be obtained
    from electrical measurements, include the Rydberg, fine-structure, Josephson,
    von Klitzing, Planck, and Faraday constants, the molar mass of the proton, the
    proton-electron mass ratio, and the shielded proton gyromagnetic ratio. This paper
    gives the expressions that relate <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> to these other
    fundamental constants and the values of <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> that can
    be obtained from these expressions using the currently available data. It also
    briefly discusses the prospects of obtaining an indirect value of <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>
    with a combined standard uncertainty that is small enough to allow the redefinition
    of the kilogram.</p>"
