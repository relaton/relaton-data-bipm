  content: "<p>Highly purified silicon single crystals are excellent standards for
    length measurements at the atomic scale and the value of the silicon (220) lattice
    spacing is an important item of information for the establishment of a self-consistent
    set of fundamental physical constants. This article surveys silicon <italic>d</italic><sub>220</sub>
    determinations by describing the measurement method and the most important features
    of x-ray/optical interferometry. A summary of the <italic>d</italic><sub>220</sub>
    values so far obtained is also given. The measurement procedure is described in
    detail, with emphasis on the critical points deserving particular attention in
    error analysis. Bottle-necks evidenced in experiments are pointed out and the
    possible evolution of x-ray/optical interferometry is analysed.</p>"
