abstract:
- content: "<p>Highly purified silicon single crystals are excellent standards for
    length measurements at the atomic scale and the value of the silicon (220) lattice
    spacing is an important item of information for the establishment of a self-consistent
    set of fundamental physical constants. This article surveys silicon d<sub>220</sub>
    determinations by describing the measurement method and the most important features
    of x-ray/optical interferometry. A summary of the d<sub>220</sub> values so far
    obtained is also given. The measurement procedure is described in detail, with
    emphasis on the critical points deserving particular attention in error analysis.
    Bottle-necks evidenced in experiments are pointed out and the possible evolution
    of x-ray/optical interferometry is analysed.</p>"
