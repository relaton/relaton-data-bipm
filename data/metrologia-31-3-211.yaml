abstract:
- content: "<p>We have determined the modulation parameters of the x-ray fringes emitted
    by a scanning symmetric LLL x-ray interferometer in order to estimate the contributions
    - in the budget of systematic errors related to the value of the Si d<sub>220</sub>
    lattice parameter - made by aberrations occurring during a non-ideal trajectory
    of the movable component. We have followed the Takagi approach to the dynamic
    theory of x-ray diffraction and used a computational tool which solves the relevant
    equations for any wavefront, for any absorption of the incident radiation and
    for the most common geometric configurations.</p>"
