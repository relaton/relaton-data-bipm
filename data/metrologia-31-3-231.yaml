  content: "<p>The ultimate roundness achievable on a 90 mm diameter sphere (ball)
    made from single-crystal silicon depends largely on the mechanics of the grinding
    and polishing process. Paramount is the uniformity of contact between the ball
    and lap while grinding or polishing in a totally random way. It is also necessary
    to have roundness and sphericity measurement capabilities which are able to resolve
    and reliably characterize surface topography down to the level of several nanometers.
    During the final fracture mode grinding process of the ball using 1 μm aluminium
    oxide abrasive a specularly reflecting surface at normal incidence is produced
    with a roundness deviation referred to the centre of the fitted least-square sphere
    (LSS) &lt; 100 nm. The character of the error surface strongly reflects the cubic
    structure of the silicon crystal, with peaks often associated with the ⟨111⟩ crystal
    axis and valleys associated with the ⟨100⟩ crystal axis. Sphericity is determined
    from a 3D data set optimally integrated into an error surface with a standard
    uncertainty of 4 nm, generated from complete sets of 2D roundness profiles measured
    on regularly sampled great circles with a standard uncertainty below 3 nm. Computer-animated
    visualizations of the sphericity error surface are used to enhance its topography,
    resulting in very clear views of the cubic symmetries arising from the fabrication
    processes and the physical properties of the silicon. After polishing, the ball
    errors based on a fitted LSS are reduced to less than ± 30 nm.</p>"
