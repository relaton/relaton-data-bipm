abstract:
- content: "<p>The present status of molar mass measurements of silicon is summarized
    because of their relevance to modern determinations of the Avogadro constant:
    principles of the measurement, measurement procedures and preparation of the synthetic
    isotope mixtures used to calibrate the measurements are described. Typical results
    are shown and the potential for improvements achievable in the near future is
    outlined.</p>"
