abstract:
- content: <p>We report first-principles density-functional theory calculations of
    the dependence of the Si lattice parameter on temperature and isotopic composition.
    The origin of the "unusual" lattice contraction on heating to about 120 K is traced
    to the entropy contribution to the Helmholtz free energy. The lattice parameter
    difference in isotopic compositions is largest at low temperature and decreases
    monotonically with increasing temperature. Far away from the defect, the defect-induced
    displacement amplitudes due to substitutional heterovalent impurities decrease
    nonmonotonically and are anisotropic.</p>
