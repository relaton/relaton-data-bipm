abstract:
- content: "<p>Silicon crystals are the key material in electronics today because
    the technology is based almost exclusively on single-crystal silicon. Modern electronic
    devices require the silicon crystals to be of very high purity and crystalline
    perfection. This paper describes the processes and problems of industrial production
    of highly pure silicon crystals and describes their properties. Because of the
    beneficial effect of oxygen during high-temperature device processing, most electronic
    devices are made from the oxygen-rich crucible-pulled Czochralski silicon. In
    experiments to determine the Avogadro constant and redefine the kilogram, only
    the purer float-zone grown silicon can be used.</p>"
