  content: "<p>The physical methods used to analyse the residual impurities in non-doped
    float-zoned silicon are presented with an emphasis on low-temperature spectroscopy.
    Photoluminescence and absorption spectra of residual impurities in high-purity
    materials illustrate the possibilities of spectroscopic techniques. The hydrostatic
    expansion of the Si lattice due to a high concentration of interstitial O (O<sub>i</sub>)
    can be probed by the stress-induced shift of C-related lines relative to the position
    in O<sub>i</sub>-lean material. Values of the volume change near the P and As
    atoms, which are residual impurities in Si, can be obtained from the electronic
    spectra; the method used is outlined and the results compared with theoretical
    calculations.</p>"
