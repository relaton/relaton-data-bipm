  content: "<p>The centrifugation method has advantages in producing silicon isotopes.
    The selection of appropriate working gas, development of gas centrifuges, their
    arrangement for effective separation of the isotopes and optimization of the production
    process are considered. The resulting mole fraction of <sup>28</sup>Si is better
    than 0,999 9. The requirements for the production processes in growing single
    crystals and the related problems are analysed in detail and estimates of the
    uncertainties associated with the necessary tests are given.</p>"
