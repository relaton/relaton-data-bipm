  content: "<p>The absolute density of Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) has been determined
    over the range 1 °C to 40 °C by weighing a hollow sphere of known volume in air-free
    water samples of measured isotopic content. The volume of the sphere as a function
    of temperature is known as a result of a combination of interferometric and mechanical
    measurements. The measured densities are tabulated. A formula (as proposed by
    Thiesen <italic>et al</italic>) and a fifth-order polynomial in temperature have
    been fitted to the tabulated data by least-squares analysis. The density calculated
    from the polynomial is estimated to have a standard uncertainty ranging from 0,64
    parts in 10<sup>6</sup> at 15 °C to 1,4 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> at 1 °C and 40
    °C. Comparisons are made with published data.</p>"
