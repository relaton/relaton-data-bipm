abstract:
- content: "<p>In Bragg's approach to the determination of the Avogadro constant,
    the measurement of silicon density as the ratio of mass to volume is an essential
    step. With a view to achieving a relative uncertainty of 10<sup>-7</sup> in the
    determination of N<sub>A</sub>, the computation of the volumes of solid density
    standards manufactured in the form of optically-polished silicon balls was investigated.
    Apart from a negligible difference, the volume considered is that of a sphere
    having the same average diameter. The estimation of the average diameter is studied
    in the angular momentum domain by using spherical harmonics as a basis and results
    are assessed by Monte Carlo simulation. The N-point approximation is investigated
    in detail and a formula for the uncertainty and sampling which minimize aliasing
    is also given. If the spectrum is bandwidth limited, it is demonstrated that N-point
    means exist, which give the average diameter exactly. The work involves least-squares
    estimation and refers to discrete Fourier transforms, Nyquist sampling criterion
    and analogies with quantum mechanical formulae.</p>"
