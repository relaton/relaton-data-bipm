  content: "<p>In Bragg's approach to the determination of the Avogadro constant,
    the measurement of silicon density as the ratio of mass to volume is an essential
    step. With a view to achieving a relative uncertainty of 10<sup>-7</sup> in the
    determination of <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>, the computation of the volumes
    of solid density standards manufactured in the form of optically-polished silicon
    balls was investigated. Apart from a negligible difference, the volume considered
    is that of a sphere having the same average diameter. The estimation of the average
    diameter is studied in the angular momentum domain by using spherical harmonics
    as a basis and results are assessed by Monte Carlo simulation. The <italic>N</italic>-point
    approximation is investigated in detail and a formula for the uncertainty and
    sampling which minimize aliasing is also given. If the spectrum is bandwidth limited,
    it is demonstrated that <italic>N</italic>-point means exist, which give the average
    diameter exactly. The work involves least-squares estimation and refers to discrete
    Fourier transforms, Nyquist sampling criterion and analogies with quantum mechanical
    formulae.</p>"
