abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes the design and testing of a method to measure
    the Newtonian gravitational constant G. The method uses a torsion balance in which
    a small cylindrical mass is suspended from a slender fibre. Two large cylindrical
    masses produce a gravitationally induced torque on the small mass. This induced
    torque is balanced by the electrostatic torque produced by an electrometer. A
    servo-control system adjusts the electrostatically induced torque so that the
    fibre does not twist during the measurement. The torque produced by the electrometer
    is calibrated by an acceleration method that uses torques much larger than those
    produced by the gravitational attraction of the large masses. Other features of
    the method include a reduction in sensitivity of the measurement to density variations
    in the suspended mass, a measurement strategy which reduces the effect of drift
    in the measurement and computer control of the measurement. Preliminary measurements
    of the terms used to calculate G showing an uncertainty of 2,5 parts in 10<sup>4</sup>
    can currently be achieved. The limiting factor at present is the variation in
    the gravitational potential seen as the apparatus accelerates. Indications are
    that further modifications and measurements will provide a value of G with an
    uncertainty of about 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>"
