  content: "<p>This paper describes the design and testing of a method to measure
    the Newtonian gravitational constant <italic>G.</italic> The method uses a torsion
    balance in which a small cylindrical mass is suspended from a slender fibre. Two
    large cylindrical masses produce a gravitationally induced torque on the small
    mass. This induced torque is balanced by the electrostatic torque produced by
    an electrometer. A servo-control system adjusts the electrostatically induced
    torque so that the fibre does not twist during the measurement. The torque produced
    by the electrometer is calibrated by an acceleration method that uses torques
    much larger than those produced by the gravitational attraction of the large masses.
    Other features of the method include a reduction in sensitivity of the measurement
    to density variations in the suspended mass, a measurement strategy which reduces
    the effect of drift in the measurement and computer control of the measurement.
    Preliminary measurements of the terms used to calculate <italic>G</italic> showing
    an uncertainty of 2,5 parts in 10<sup>4</sup> can currently be achieved. The limiting
    factor at present is the variation in the gravitational potential seen as the
    apparatus accelerates. Indications are that further modifications and measurements
    will provide a value of <italic>G</italic> with an uncertainty of about 1 part
    in 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>"
