abstract:
- content: "<p>It would appear from a publication by K A Nugent and J L Gardner (1992
    Metrologia 29 319-324) that the so-called correlation-induced shifts of spectral
    lines can be interpreted as a diffraction effect. Explicit calculations are presented,
    showing that the effect occurs even in partially coherent light propagating in
    free space, in the absence of any diffracting bodies.</p>"
