abstract:
- content: "<p>Some fifteen years ago, the Institut National de Métrologie (France)
    opted to produce its secondary mass standards in XSH alacrite and adopted a mechanical
    cleaning method using ethanol and isopropanol. This paper concerns the influence
    of this cleaning method and presents some of the results obtained on two alacrite
    kilograms. The influence of the cleaning process is not the same on the two standards
    which are nevertheless as similar as possible from the manufacturing point of
    view. Alcohol cleaning leads to mass variations of several tens of micrograms
    causing the standard to be unstable for several months. It finally reaches a mass
    value that is stable, but is not reproducible.</p>"
