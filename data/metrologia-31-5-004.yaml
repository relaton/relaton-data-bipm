abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate measurements have been made of the quantized Hall resistance
    (QHR) corresponding to the quantum number  i  = 2,  R<sub>H</sub> (2), of two
    GaAs-based heterostructures using alternating current in the frequency range from
    1 Hz to 1,6 kHz. The QHR is compared with a conventional ac reference resistance
    standard (Vishay type) of the same nominal value. The measurements are made with
    an alternating current comparator bridge at 1 Hz and with a coaxial ac bridge
    from 400 Hz to 1,6 kHz. The quantum Hall effect (QHE) sample is connected to the
    coaxial bridge using a double series connection. An analysis of the circuit properties
    of the sample shows that this technique of connection is sufficient to define
    the QHR as a four terminal-pair impedance. It also avoids perturbing effects from
    small capacitances between the terminals of the sample and from inductive reactances
    in series with the terminals. At frequencies up to at least 1,6 kHz a central
    region on the Hall resistance plateau has been observed for which the Hall resistance
    \ R<sub>H</sub> (2) is independent of the magnetic flux density to within 1 part
    in 10<sup>8</sup>. The ratio of  R<sub>H</sub> (2) to the reference resistance
    varies by less than 2 parts in 10<sup>7</sup> from 1 Hz to 1,6 kHz. A significant
    part of this variation is probably due to the frequency dependence of the reference
    resistance itself.</p>"
