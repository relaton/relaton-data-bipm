  content: "<p>An intercomparison of two <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> stabilized He-Ne
    lasers at λ ≈ 543 nm, recommended as length standards, has been made between the
    DFM and the PTB, and is the first international comparison at this wavelength
    reported so far. Both lasers use saturated absorption of iodine in an external
    cell, one (PTB) using frequency-modulation spectroscopy, the other (DFM) using
    the first or third harmonic detection techniques. The range of the frequency differences
    between the two lasers was from 11,8 kHz to 18,4 kHz, with a mean of Δ<italic>f</italic>
    = 14,2 kHz and a standard uncertainty of 1,9 kHz. A minimum value for the two-probe
    relative standard uncertainty of 2,5 × 10<sup>-13</sup> (140 Hz) is reached after
    5 000 s. The hyperfine line splittings were measured by the beat-frequency technique,
    and good agreement was found between the two completely different laser systems.
    Measurements of frequency dependence on modulation amplitude, iodine pressure,
    and pump power are also reported.</p>"
