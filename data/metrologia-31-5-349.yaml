abstract:
- content: "<p>An expression for the attenuation of a plated coaxial line that is
    applicable over the entire usable frequency range of the line is derived. The
    result compares well with experiment and shows that accurate line attenuation
    estimates are possible for plated lines even in the presence of a complicated
    plating surface such as diffused copper and gold.</p>"
