  content: "<p>Accurate measurements have been made of the quantized Hall resistance
    (QHR) corresponding to the quantum number <italic>i</italic> = 2, <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub>
    (2), of two GaAs-based heterostructures using alternating current in the frequency
    range from 1 Hz to 1,6 kHz. The QHR is compared with a conventional ac reference
    resistance standard (Vishay type) of the same nominal value. The measurements
    are made with an alternating current comparator bridge at 1 Hz and with a coaxial
    ac bridge from 400 Hz to 1,6 kHz. The quantum Hall effect (QHE) sample is connected
    to the coaxial bridge using a double series connection. An analysis of the circuit
    properties of the sample shows that this technique of connection is sufficient
    to define the QHR as a four terminal-pair impedance. It also avoids perturbing
    effects from small capacitances between the terminals of the sample and from inductive
    reactances in series with the terminals. At frequencies up to at least 1,6 kHz
    a central region on the Hall resistance plateau has been observed for which the
    Hall resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub> (2) is independent of the magnetic
    flux density to within 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>. The ratio of <italic>R</italic><sub>H</sub>
    (2) to the reference resistance varies by less than 2 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>
    from 1 Hz to 1,6 kHz. A significant part of this variation is probably due to
    the frequency dependence of the reference resistance itself.</p>"
