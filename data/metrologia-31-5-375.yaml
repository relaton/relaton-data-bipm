  content: "<p>In a previous study (Part I) we showed that the material used for national
    prototype and reference masses, Pt-10% Ir, is susceptible to mercury contamination
    even at the very low levels of mercury present in air in weighing laboratories.
    In this study we measure the mass uptake per unit area of Pt-10% Ir exposed to
    mercury vapour, as a function of time, using the mass response of a quartz crystal
    microbalance with electrodes of Pt-10% Ir. This system can detect with accuracy
    mass increases equivalent to less than 0,1 Î¼g on a prototype kilogram. It is shown
    that there is a rapid adsorption of the first monolayer of mercury, but this mercury
    then diffuses into the solid allowing further mercury to adsorb. The quantity
    of mercury absorbed does not tend towards any immediate limit, but instead continues
    to grow in proportion to the square root of time. A consideration of the morphology
    of polished surfaces suggests this growth will continue for between 10 and 600
    years. We conclude that our earlier recommendation to clean all environments where
    reference masses are housed, particularly with regard to mercury, is essential
    for maintaining the stability of Pt-10% Ir masses. Significant mass instability
    due to mercury sorption will occur for atmospheric mercury levels well below current
    health and safety limits.</p>"
