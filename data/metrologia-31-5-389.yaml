  content: "<p>Modulation broadening of the iodine absorption components of a <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    stabilized He-Ne laser at the transition 11-5, R(127) is studied in this report.
    The mathematical model used for computer simulation is described. Simulation results
    are presented for the frequently used d, e, f and g components and compared with
    the results of the measurements. The effect of <sup>127</sup>I<sup>129</sup>I
    components on <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> absorption spectra is investigated.
    The level of the relative <sup>127</sup>I<sup>129</sup>I line strength can be
    readily found by fitting the simulation results into the measured frequency shift
    data. The limitations of the conventional matrix analysis in the presence of <sup>129</sup>I
    are considered.</p>"
