abstract:
- content: "<p>Modulation broadening of the iodine absorption components of a<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    stabilized He-Ne laser at the transition 11-5, R(127) is studied in this report.
    The mathematical model used for computer simulation is described. Simulation results
    are presented for the frequently used d, e, f and g components and compared with
    the results of the measurements. The effect of<sup>127</sup>I<sup>129</sup>I components
    on<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> absorption spectra is investigated. The level of
    the relative<sup>127</sup>I<sup>129</sup>I line strength can be readily found
    by fitting the simulation results into the measured frequency shift data. The
    limitations of the conventional matrix analysis in the presence of<sup>129</sup>I
    are considered.</p>"
