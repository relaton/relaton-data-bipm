  content: <p>A brief presentation is given of the most important developments in
    the history of quantity calculus. Starting with the early introduction of the
    concept "physical quantity" by Maxwell in his work on electricity and magnetism,
    attention is focused in particular on the foundations of the calculus with physical
    quantities given by Wallot in the 1920s. For illustration and better understanding
    of the praxis of quantity calculus, special attention is paid to the three- and
    four-dimensional systems of physical quantities used for theoretical description
    in the fields of electricity and magnetism. Special emphasis is placed on understanding
    controversies and confusion caused by differences in interpretation of the concepts
    "quantity" and "unit" in physical language and in the mathematical description
    of physical phenomena. A short presentation is given of the further development
    of various studies on the algebraic structure and the axiomatic foundation of
    the calculus with physical quantities developed by Landolt, Stille, Fleischmann
    and others. Quantity calculus constituted the basis for obtaining consensus on
    the introduction of the International System of Units (SI) and allowed the formulation
    of international standards on definitions and symbols for quantities and units
    by the various international scientific and standardizing organizations.</p>
