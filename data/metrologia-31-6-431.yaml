abstract:
- content: "<p>An application of atomic frequency standards is the establishment of
    atomic time scales. International Atomic Time is the official basis by which events
    are dated. However, the need to distinguish between theoretical times and their
    realizations, the need for a relativistic treatment and the survival of previous
    astronomical times generate a complex situation. Specific problems raised by time
    scales, the relationships they have with one another and with the successive definitions
    of the second, are examined.</p>"
