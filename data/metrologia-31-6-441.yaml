abstract:
- content: "<p>First, a historical emphasis is developed by a short review of the
    relationships between the ampere, the kilogram and the fundamental constants.
    Then, progress in Japan on the absolute determination of the electrical quantities
    and fundamental constants is reviewed. Following this, the technological basis
    of the absolute determination of the magnetic flux quantum (Φ<sub>0</sub>) is
    presented with emphasis on the basic concepts. This is followed by a discussion
    of the uncontrolled parameters accompanying a variety of sources of uncertainty
    in the realization of the principle. Finally, the significance of the Φ<sub>0</sub>
    determination is discussed with an assessment of the prospects it offers with
    respect to the relationship between the ampere and the kilogram.</p>"
