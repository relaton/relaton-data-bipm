abstract:
- content: "<p>The use of the term amount of substance of an elementary entity is
    expounded. Methods of measurement of the ratio of two amounts of substance are
    described. The SI unit of amount of substance, the mole, is introduced. Quantities
    involving amount of substance, including molar mass, molar quantities in general,
    the Avogadro constant, the molar gas constant, and the Faraday constant, are defined.
    An historical account is given of the notion of amount of substance and of the
    unit mole. Some personal views are advanced about the desirability of a new name
    for amount of substance and for derived quantities.</p>"
