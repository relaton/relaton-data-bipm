- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The use of the term <italic>amount of substance</italic> of an <italic>elementary
    entity</italic> is expounded. Methods of measurement of the ratio of two amounts
    of substance are described. The SI unit of amount of substance, the mole, is introduced.
    Quantities involving amount of substance, including molar mass, molar quantities
    in general, the Avogadro constant, the molar gas constant, and the Faraday constant,
    are defined. An historical account is given of the notion of amount of substance
    and of the unit mole. Some personal views are advanced about the desirability
    of a new name for amount of substance and for derived quantities.</p>"
