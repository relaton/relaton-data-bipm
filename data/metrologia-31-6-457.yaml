  content: "<p>Recent international political developments have given rise to the
    formation of powerful free trade and economic areas. This situation has placed
    new demands on metrology. Starting from the objectives and tasks of the national
    metrology institutes, the traditional activities are realization, maintenance
    and dissemination of the units. For quality assurance in industry, the traceability
    of measurement and test equipment to national measurement standards and its assurance
    plays an important part. In individual countries, national calibration services
    and testing laboratories form an indispensable modern infrastructure for the distribution
    of metrological competence. The creation of a uniform single European market and
    the recent establishment of the European Economic Area (EEA) from 1 January 1994,
    have given metrology new impetus. The dissemination of the units in the intraregional
    European area - with the objective of mutually recognizing calibration certificates
    by removing technical barriers to trade - requires not only technical competence
    but also transparency through confidence-building measures. The traceability of
    measurements and their assurance by interlaboratory comparisons are of decisive
    importance and require that international cooperation should be extended. Moreover,
    countries outside the EEA have shown an increasing interest in the mutual recognition
    of certificates so an interregional assurance of traceability has to be guaranteed.
    As a result of this development, international organizations of long standing
    such as the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) are confronted with
    new tasks and new organizations such as the International Laboratory Accreditation
    Conference (ILAC) have been formed.</p>"
