abstract:
- content: "<p>Many international organizations have contributed to the development
    of the International System of Units (SI). The highest international authority
    on units is the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), which is an
    intergovernmental body. Legal aspects of units and metrology are dealt with by
    the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML), whereas scientific questions
    in this field are dealt with by scientific unions such as the International Union
    of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), and the International Union of Pure and Applied
    Chemistry (IUPAC). Among their many tasks the international standards organizations,
    i.e. the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International
    Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), implement the SI as adopted by the CGPM. They
    also standardize quantities, i.e. their definitions, names, and letter symbols.
    The main purpose of this article is to present these two organizations for standardization
    and to describe their role in the standardization of quantities and units.</p>"
