abstract:
- content: "<p>An outline is given of the organizational structure of the Convention
    du Mètre, the basis for international agreement on units of measurement, followed
    by a brief discussion on why accurate measurements are required. The Système International
    d'Unités (SI) is introduced and the definition and practical realization of each
    of its base units are discussed. Prospects for improvements in their practical
    realizations and, in the case of the kilogram, prospects for a new definition
    based on atomic or fundamental constants are outlined.</p>"
