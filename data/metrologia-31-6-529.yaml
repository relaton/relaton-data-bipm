  content: "<p>Experience and experimental results obtained from joint research on
    the transfer of metrology standards by Japan and Asian countries over about twenty
    years are presented. Transferred technologies on length, mass, temperature, volume
    and pressure standards in the tropics are described. The present situation of
    force standards in Asia is discussed in terms of the results of intercomparisons.</p>"
