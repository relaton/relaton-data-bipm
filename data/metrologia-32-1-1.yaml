abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper develops a model that provides the means to calculate the
    errors and uncertainties in radiation thermometry measurements affected by reflections.
    This addresses the serious and frequently encountered problem of ensuring traceability
    when measuring the temperature of non-black objects. Measurement strategies are
    outlined for the three situations where there exists an extraneous source of radiation
    at a much lower, similar, and much higher temperature than that of the object
    of interest. In the first strategy shorter-wavelength thermometers have smaller
    reflection errors and experimental uncertainties than longer-wavelength thermometers.
    In the second strategy there is an optimum operating wavelength that makes a compromise
    between the reflection error and the uncertainty. In the third strategy, which
    corrects for the reflection error, there is also an optimum wavelength for which
    the uncertainty attains a minimum value. By considering all of the practical factors
    involved, this approach reveals limitations in previous error analyses which concluded
    that the longest-wavelength thermometers should be used to minimize reflection
    errors. Recommendations are given for the use of the three strategies in minimizing
    reflection errors and uncertainties.</p>"
