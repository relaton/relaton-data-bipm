abstract:
- content: "<p>LASSO is a time transfer experiment which uses a laser link to a geostationary
    satellite. It allows time comparisons between remote clocks. A new concept of
    operation is proposed: the comparison of ground clocks by monitoring the satellite
    clock seen from each station. This technique has been successfully tested between
    McDonald Observatory (Texas) and the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur (France).
    The common sessions show that LASSO allows intercontinental time transfer, as
    well as satellite clock monitoring, with a precision better than 100 picoseconds.</p>"
