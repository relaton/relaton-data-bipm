abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a report on an international comparison of Automatic Network
    Analysers (ANAs) carried out between three European standards laboratories: the
    NPL (UK), the Telecom-PTT (Switzerland) and the VSL (the Netherlands). Six different
    transfer standards consisting of a 50 Ω air line, a 25 Ω Beatty standard, a 20
    dB attenuator, a 50 dB attenuator, and two terminations, all fitted with type-N
    50 Ω connectors, were used, and measurements were made of reflection and transmission
    parameters over the frequency range 0,4 GHz to 18 GHz. A selection of the results
    is presented with some analysis of the implications of the results for the different
    calibration procedures and their relative advantages. The problems inherent in
    comparing the large amounts of data generated by ANAs is also discussed and examples
    are given of some of the methods of displaying such data in a useful manner.</p>"
