abstract:
- content: "<p>A critical review is presented of the parameters which are continuously
    or periodically verified in order to maintain the long-term stability of BIPM
    standards of air kerma and absorbed dose for<sup>60</sup>Co. Some problems encountered
    in the measurement of the ionization current and in the determination of calibration
    factors are described and resolved.</p>"
