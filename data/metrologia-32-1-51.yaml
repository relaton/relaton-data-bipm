  content: "<p>Two-way time transfer via satellite is one of the most precise methods
    of time synchronization. This method makes it possible to obtain 0,1 nanosecond
    precision and decrease systematic error to the nanosecond level. The two-way time
    transfer system designed in Russia and the results of experiments are described.
    The experiments consist of two-way time transfer via satellite, ground station
    delay measurements and a relativity effect calculation. The results of two-way
    time transfer are compared with GLONASS data.</p>"
