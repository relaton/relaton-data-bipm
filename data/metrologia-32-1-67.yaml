    <p>27-30 September 1995, Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, UK</p><p>First announcement</p><p>The conference is the first in a Euroconference Series on the theme of advanced mathematical tools in metrology. Its aims are to present and promote recent and current applications of mathematical modelling and analysis. statistics, numerical methods and software to metrology/measurement science.</p><p>Emphasis will be placed on the benefits that mathematical tools can bring to problems facing researchers and practitioners of metrology. Tutorial sessions in key areas of mathematics will support the applications talks.</p><p>A previous meeting on the subject, in Torino in September 1993, led to improved communication between several organizations and acted as a catalyst for developing a number of international collaborations.</p><p>Metrologists will benefit from formal and informal opportunities to discuss problems. Mathematicians
    will gain from an increased awareness of a range of metrological disciplines and the identification of common areas for mathematical application. Important themes will be realistic statistical uncertainty estimation and quality management systems.</p><p>Support for a number of young European researchers is available.</p><p>Call for papers</p><p>There are opportunities for a limited number of unsolicited papers. Abstracts of at most 300 words should be submitted to the address below by 14 April 1995 by e-mail, fax, or conventional mail. LaTeX source is encouraged. Indicate your full name, organization, address, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address.</p><p>It is intended that the proceedings will be published.</p><p>Further details are available from the following address.
