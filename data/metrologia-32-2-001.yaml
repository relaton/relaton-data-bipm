abstract:
- content: "<p>An analysis of the resistance-temperature relationship for six low-temperature
    platinum resistance thermometers is carried out to determine the thermodynamic
    accuracy of the ITS-90 below 273 K. The use of smooth thermodynamic functions
    in a model equation for platinum resistance indicates that there is a significant
    deviation of the ITS-90 from thermodynamic values over the range 80 K to 270 K.
    The deviation is consistent with recent results in acoustic and gas thermometry,
    namely around 10 mK at 150 K. For this reason a re-evaluation of the existing
    thermodynamic data on the temperature scale appears warranted.</p>"
