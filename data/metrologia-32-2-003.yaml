abstract:
- content: "<p>The triple point of mercury appears to be assigned an incorrect temperature
    on the ITS-90. This conclusion is based on fixed-point correlations and the disagreement
    of the a-coefficients for the deviation functions associated with the calibration
    of platinum resistance thermometers above and below 273,16 K. The disagreement
    of the a-coefficients is particularly important as it implies a slope discontinuity
    in the ITS-90 at 273,16 K. The proposed remedy involves modification of the ITS-90
    platinum resistance thermometer low-temperature reference function. With the revised
    reference function, it is also necessary to lower the argon triple point temperature
    by 0,7 mK to 83,8051 K to preserve acceptable sub-range consistency. The mercury
    point retains its ITS-90 assigned value of 234,3156 K. With this modification,
    the a-coefficient obtained from any sub-range calibration above 273,16 K may be
    used in the low-temperature deviation functions in place of a measurement at the
    mercury triple point.</p>"
