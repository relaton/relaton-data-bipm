abstract:
- content: "<p>A horizontal cavity-type tungsten crucible with alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
    inside was manufactured to realize a high-temperature reference point near 2000°C.
    Melting and freezing plateaus with a supercooling phase were observed. The melting
    temperature is about 2045°C which is lower, by 8°C, than previously reported values.</p>"
