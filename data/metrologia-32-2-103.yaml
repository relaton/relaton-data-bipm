  content: <p>The chemical steps needed to prepare specimens for "absolute" atomic-weight
    [(mean) relative atomic mass] determinations are outlined and discussed in detail
    for the atomic weight of silicon, <italic>A</italic><sub>r</sub> (Si), as recently
    measured for a redetermination of the Avogadro constant. The estimated combined
    uncertainties arising from the chemical procedures in that <italic>A</italic><sub>r</sub>
    (Si) measurement are shown to be almost equal to those from the associated mass-spectrometric
    measurements.</p>
