abstract:
- content: <p>The chemical steps needed to prepare specimens for "absolute" atomic-weight
    [(mean) relative atomic mass] determinations are outlined and discussed in detail
    for the atomic weight of silicon, A<sub>r</sub> (Si), as recently measured for
    a redetermination of the Avogadro constant. The estimated combined uncertainties
    arising from the chemical procedures in that A<sub>r</sub> (Si) measurement are
    shown to be almost equal to those from the associated mass-spectrometric measurements.</p>
