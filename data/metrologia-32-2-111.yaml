abstract:
- content: "<p>Three independently developed and conceptually different algorithms
    to calculate the volume of nearly perfect spheres with high precision have been
    applied and compared. Spherical harmonic decomposition, direct numerical integration
    and B-spline interpolation over radial data points have been applied to common
    data sets derived from sphericity measurements on 93 mm nominal diameter spheres
    manufactured from single crystals of silicon with maximum radial peak-to-valley
    errors ranging from 54 nm to 259 nm. Sphericity measurements are relative to an
    arbitrary datum sphere and for this comparison of calculated volume they have
    therefore been normalized using a nominal value for mean diameter. Five measurement
    sets on four different spheres were analysed and the range of calculated volumes
    for the three algorithms varied from 0,8 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> to 4 parts in
    10<sup>9</sup>.</p>"
