abstract:
- content: "<p>The quotient h/m<sub>n</sub> (h Planck constant, m<sub>n</sub> neutron
    mass) has been measured with a relative uncertainty of 7,7 × 10<sup>-8</sup>.
    The result is h/m<sub>n</sub> = 3,956 033 320 (302) × 10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>.
    To obtain it, a beam of neutrons with an identical and well-known wavelength was
    produced by Bragg reflection in a perfect silicon crystal; the velocity of the
    neutrons was measured using a very precise time-of-flight method. According to
    the de Broglie equation, h/m<sub>n</sub> is equal to the product of these two
    quantities. From h/m<sub>n</sub> the value of the fine-structure constant α can
    be derived. The measured value of h/m<sub>n</sub> leads to α<sup>-1</sup> = 137,03601082
    (524) (relative uncertainty 3,9 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). The experiment was carried
    out at the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France.</p>"
