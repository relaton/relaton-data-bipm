  content: "<p>A set of seven gauge blocks was circulated and calibrated by ten European
    national metrology institutes and one accredited laboratory. Measurements were
    made of central length, variation in length, flatness and, where possible, of
    the coefficient of thermal expansion. Agreement on the measurement results for
    the central length is excellent. It lies roughly within Â±20 nm and seems to depend
    less on length than on the quality of the measurement faces, their wringing capability
    and the skill of the operator. The measurements of flatness and variation in length,
    on the other hand, differ substantially from one to another. A comparison of these
    results is difficult, however, since in practical measurements, the border zone
    defined by the standard is not quantitatively implemented. The few reported measurements
    of the thermal expansion coefficient are in good agreement. The comparison reflects
    the state of the art of gauge block calibration in Western European national metrology
    institutes. It also raises the question of whether the tolerances for flatness
    and variation in length can be checked interferometrically with reasonable effort.</p>"
