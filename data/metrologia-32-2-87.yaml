  content: "<p>The triple point of mercury appears to be assigned an incorrect temperature
    on the ITS-90. This conclusion is based on fixed-point correlations and the disagreement
    of the <italic>a</italic>-coefficients for the deviation functions associated
    with the calibration of platinum resistance thermometers above and below 273,16
    K. The disagreement of the <italic>a</italic>-coefficients is particularly important
    as it implies a slope discontinuity in the ITS-90 at 273,16 K. The proposed remedy
    involves modification of the ITS-90 platinum resistance thermometer low-temperature
    reference function. With the revised reference function, it is also necessary
    to lower the argon triple point temperature by 0,7 mK to 83,8051 K to preserve
    acceptable sub-range consistency. The mercury point retains its ITS-90 assigned
    value of 234,3156 K. With this modification, the <italic>a</italic>-coefficient
    obtained from any sub-range calibration above 273,16 K may be used in the low-temperature
    deviation functions in place of a measurement at the mercury triple point.</p>"
