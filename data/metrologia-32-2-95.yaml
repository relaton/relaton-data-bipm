  content: "<p>Internal-mirror helium-neon lasers operating at the wavelengths 543
    nm, 612 nm and 633 nm have been frequency locked to iodine transitions using modulation
    transfer with the same simple external cell stabilizing system. With this inexpensive
    system, the 633 nm laser exhibited a frequency reproducibility better than 1 part
    in 10<sup>10</sup> and results indicate even better stability for the other two
    lasers. These lasers could therefore be used as national standards for length
    measurement.</p>"
