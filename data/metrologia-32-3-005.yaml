abstract:
- content: "<p>In the error budget for absolute measurements of g, one of the most
    important contributions is the uncertainty of the frequency of the stabilized
    laser used as the reference wavelength. This was confirmed during the third International
    Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters held at the BIPM in 1989, at which the frequencies
    of all the lasers used in the gravimeters were checked by beat frequency against
    a BIPM reference laser. This problem was solved by the replacement of a He-Ne
    laser at λ ≈ 633 nm stabilized by the requirement that the intensity of two orthogonal
    modes be equal by a laser stabilized with respect to the saturated absorption
    of iodine at the same wavelength. A new design of portable laser, realized at
    the BIPM and developed by commercial companies, is described and the capabilities
    of this laser for use as a primary standard of wavelength or reference wavelength
    in a new generation of absolute gravimeters are presented. The results of the
    frequency calibration of the lasers used in the absolute gravimeters which participated
    in the fourth International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters held at the BIPM
    in May and June 1994 are also presented.</p>"
