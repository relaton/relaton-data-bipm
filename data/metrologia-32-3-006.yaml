abstract:
- content: "<p>Data from the 1994 International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters
    were processed with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    Geosciences Lab protocols and processing algorithms. The rootmean-square discrepancy
    between results obtained from individual groups and the NOAA processing is 2,3
    μGal; the average discrepancy is 1,5 μGal. The sources of the discrepancies are
    probably (i) differences in the vertical gradients used for datum level transfers,
    (ii) inconsistencies between processing algorithms, and (iii) differences in data
    editing criteria.</p>"
