abstract:
- content: "<p>Artificial accelerations are used for the absolute calibration of relative
    gravimeters. Such accelerations are generated by the Frankfurt calibration system.
    The system consists of three stepper-motor-driven spindle blocks which can be
    mounted on any arbitrary body: here in the experiment a platform where spring
    gravimeters can be placed. The vertical motions of stepper-motor-driven spindle
    blocks are controlled by glass gauges. In a digital feedback loop, imperfections
    of the screw can be compensated. The driving functions for the stepper motors
    are sinusoidal waves with periods between 200 s and 2400 s. With the stroke of
    the system (± 10 mm) artificial accelerations up to ± 1000 × 10<sup>-8</sup> m
    s<sup>-2</sup> can be generated. During the experiment twelve gravimeters were
    investigated. The calibration factors as well as the frequency transfer functions
    of the instruments were determined with accuracies of better than 10<sup>-3</sup>.
    The results coincide well with the calibration factors derived from the gravity
    calibration line in Sèvres for the same instruments.</p>"
