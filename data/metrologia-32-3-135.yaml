    <p>Measurement of the acceleration due to gravity (<italic>g</italic>) began in the mid-seventeenth century when C Huygens constructed the first pendulum clock. Until 1818 all gravity determinations were absolute (i.e. the value of  <italic>g</italic> was evaluated). In that year a pendulum device suitable for relative gravimetry in the field (the gravity difference between two sites being the observed quantity) was first employed. Since then the use of relative gravimetry has increased rapidly, first with the development of sophisticated pendulum devices and then with spring-type gravimeters. A very high level of accuracy, sometimes a few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>, can now be achieved.</p>
    <p>However, relative gravimetry relies on absolute gravimetry for the determination of the gravity datum and of the gravity scale, the latter being important for the calibration of relative gravimeters. After the Second World War, with the development of lasers and of high-precision time-interval counters, the ballistic method began to be employed in the measurement of  <italic>g</italic>. Today some thirty absolute gravimeters are available world wide and are used in classical geodetic projects (gravity datum and scale) and in projects dealing with crustal deformations, volcanic and seismic hazards, sea level fluctuation and so on.</p>
    <p>The International Gravity Commission, a body of the International Association of Geodesy, has since 1981 recognized the need for periodic comparisons of absolute gravimeters in order to detect possible systematic errors and to define the accuracy level of the methodology. A Working Group (WG6 - Intercomparison of Absolute Gravimeters) is responsible for the organization of these comparisons.</p>
    <p>This special issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> is devoted to the Fourth International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG94) which was held in SÃ¨vres, at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, from 24 May to 8 June 1994. Eleven absolute gravimeters from Austria, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, the USA and the BIPM took part in the comparison. At the same time, fourteen relative gravimeters were used to observe a microgravity network covering the five sites chosen for the absolute gravimeters and to measure the vertical gradient of  <italic>g</italic> at each site.</p>
    <p>ICAG94 also provided the opportunity to intercompare relative gravimeters and measuring techniques, as well as new calibration tools for these devices.</p>
    <p>A workshop, where instrument features, data processing and analysis procedures were discussed in detail, completed the meeting.</p>
    <p>Following the 1994 series of measurements, WG6 has decided to continue the comparisons at the BIPM on a four-yearly basis, supplemented by secondary comparisons to be organized on a continental scale (North America, Europe and Asia) to allow for an easier and possibly wider participation. The first such meeting has since been held at the Table Mountain Geophysical Observatory, NOAA, Boulder, CO, USA, in 1995.</p>
    <p>Technological progress and the development of new devices for ballistic gravimetry call for a constant effort to be made in the comparison and validation of the gravimeters, both absolute and relative, used in scientific research and services to third parties.</p>
