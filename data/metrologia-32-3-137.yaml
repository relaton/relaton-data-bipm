abstract:
- content: "<p>In 1994, from 24 May to 8 June, the fourth International Comparison
    of Absolute Gravimeters was held at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures,
    Sèvres, France. Eleven absolute gravimeters were operated at five sites and then
    compared by means of a high-precision gravity network which was itself observed
    throughout the period. The results demonstrate that absolute gravimetry can be
    carried out to an accuracy of 3 μGal to 4 μGal, which represents a substantial
    improvement since the first international comparison (1981, 10 μGal). The relatively
    low rate of improvement, one third of an order of magnitude in fifteen years,
    is certainly limited by current technology for measuring small time and space
    intervals. A notable finding of the comparison was an unsuspected source of systematic
    error which can be eliminated by new hardware or corrected through a correction
    algorithm.</p>"
