abstract:
- content: "<p>Observations made with the JILA2 absolute gravimeter operated by the
    Geological Survey of Canada, during the 1989 and 1994 International Comparisons
    of Absolute Gravimeters, show that orientation-dependent systematic errors are
    introduced at the BIPM A3 site. With improved electronics, we can better identify
    instrument-induced vibrations which have a deleterious effect on the observations.
    Observations made in 1989 are compared with the measurements made in 1994. Furthermore,
    instrument orientation in 1994 is shown to have a damaging effect on the observations.
    This may suggest better designs for absolute gravity piers located on unconsolidated
    material.</p>"
