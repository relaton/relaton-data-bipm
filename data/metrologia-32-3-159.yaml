  content: "<p>We describe the design improvements incorporated in a new generation
    of absolute gravimeters, the FG5. A vertically oriented (in-line) interferometer
    design is used to remove the influence of floor vibration and tilt on the optical
    path length. The interferometer uses an iodine-stabilized laser as a primary length
    standard, with circuitry for automatic peak detection and locking. The seismic
    isolation system is an active long-period seismometer (Super Spring). The new
    design has improved passive isolation and thermal drift characteristics over previous
    systems. Programming flexibility and control of the test mass trajectory have
    been improved. The computer system has also improved real-time analysis and system
    capability. The FG5 instrument has a higher level of robustness, reliability and
    ease of use. These design advances have led to an instrumental uncertainty estimate
    of 1,1 × 10<sup>-8</sup> m s<sup>-2</sup> (1,0 μGal). Instrument agreement among
    nine similar devices is 1,8 μGal and observations under optimal conditions exhibit
    standard deviations of 5 μGal to 8 μGal.</p>"
