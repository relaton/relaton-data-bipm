  content: "<p>In the error budget for absolute measurements of <italic>g</italic>,
    one of the most important contributions is the uncertainty of the frequency of
    the stabilized laser used as the reference wavelength. This was confirmed during
    the third International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters held at the BIPM in
    1989, at which the frequencies of all the lasers used in the gravimeters were
    checked by beat frequency against a BIPM reference laser. This problem was solved
    by the replacement of a He-Ne laser at λ ≈ 633 nm stabilized by the requirement
    that the intensity of two orthogonal modes be equal by a laser stabilized with
    respect to the saturated absorption of iodine at the same wavelength. A new design
    of portable laser, realized at the BIPM and developed by commercial companies,
    is described and the capabilities of this laser for use as a primary standard
    of wavelength or reference wavelength in a new generation of absolute gravimeters
    are presented. The results of the frequency calibration of the lasers used in
    the absolute gravimeters which participated in the fourth International Comparison
    of Absolute Gravimeters held at the BIPM in May and June 1994 are also presented.</p>"
