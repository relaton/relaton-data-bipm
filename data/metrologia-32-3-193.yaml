abstract:
- content: "<p>Data from FG5 absolute gravimeters have been analysed using processing
    software developed by Edinburgh University. The work aims to understand apparent
    inconsistencies between relative and absolute observations and the variation of
    absolute gravity estimates outside the 10 nm s<sup>-2</sup> to 20 nm s<sup>-2</sup>
    (10 nm s<sup>-2</sup> = 1 Î¼Gal) range expected for FG5 instruments. Data from
    FG5-103 at Edinburgh, Birkenhead, Teddington and Taunton, FG5-107 at Taunton,
    FG5-105 at Teddington and FG5-101 at Onsala, Sweden, have been reprocessed. Fitting
    time-distance pairs to an equation of motion without a vertical gradient of gravity
    gives an estimate for g at some fraction of the way down the drop. None of the
    current theories correctly predicts the observed fraction of 0,43, so accurate
    results can only be found by including the vertical gradient terms to obtain a
    value of gravity at the top of the drop. Observations of the vertical gradient
    at some absolute sites have shown it to be nonlinear, so that using the same value
    in the equation of motion as for datum corrections can lead to significant errors.
    Solving the full equation of motion should give a constant estimate of gravity
    for all lengths or starting positions of the drop. This is rarely the case in
    the samples analysed here and the estimates may vary by up to 250 nm s<sup>-2</sup>.
    Systematic site- and instrument-dependent structure in the time-position residuals
    biases the solution. Removing the stacked residuals produces gravity estimates
    which are constant and independent of the drop length or starting position. In
    order to find the gravity offset caused by the system response, the residuals
    are modelled by a small number of damped sinusoids.</p>"
