  content: "<p>Data from FG5 absolute gravimeters have been analysed using processing
    software developed by Edinburgh University. The work aims to understand apparent
    inconsistencies between relative and absolute observations and the variation of
    absolute gravity estimates outside the 10 nm s<sup>-2</sup> to 20 nm s<sup>-2</sup>
    (10 nm s<sup>-2</sup> = 1 Î¼Gal) range expected for FG5 instruments. Data from
    FG5-103 at Edinburgh, Birkenhead, Teddington and Taunton, FG5-107 at Taunton,
    FG5-105 at Teddington and FG5-101 at Onsala, Sweden, have been reprocessed. Fitting
    time-distance pairs to an equation of motion without a vertical gradient of gravity
    gives an estimate for <italic>g</italic> at some fraction of the way down the
    drop. None of the current theories correctly predicts the observed fraction of
    0,43, so accurate results can only be found by including the vertical gradient
    terms to obtain a value of gravity at the top of the drop. Observations of the
    vertical gradient at some absolute sites have shown it to be nonlinear, so that
    using the same value in the equation of motion as for datum corrections can lead
    to significant errors. Solving the full equation of motion should give a constant
    estimate of gravity for all lengths or starting positions of the drop. This is
    rarely the case in the samples analysed here and the estimates may vary by up
    to 250 nm s<sup>-2</sup>. Systematic site- and instrument-dependent structure
    in the time-position residuals biases the solution. Removing the stacked residuals
    produces gravity estimates which are constant and independent of the drop length
    or starting position. In order to find the gravity offset caused by the system
    response, the residuals are modelled by a small number of damped sinusoids.</p>"
