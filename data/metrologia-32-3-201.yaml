abstract:
- content: "<p>A new approach to the analysis of absolute gravimeter operation proposes
    that the measured value of gravity should be found as a mean-weighted value of
    the acceleration of a free-moving body averaged within every measurement. The
    weighting functions of absolute gravimeters are determined. They depend on the
    gravimeter model used and the allocation of chosen data points within a single
    measurement. The effective measurement heights of absolute gravimeters can thus
    be found and the corrections due to linear gravity gradient and finite speed of
    light established. The results presented cover both direct free-fall and symmetric
    rise-and-fall types of apparatus.</p>"
