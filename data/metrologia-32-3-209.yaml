abstract:
- content: "<p>At the 1994 International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters in SÃ¨vres,
    a platform oscillating vertically with a sinusoidal motion was used to produce
    defined accelerations which were applied to gravimeters for their calibration.
    Gravimeters equipped with different types of feedback systems were compared. This
    allowed an evaluation of filtering effects. A long series of tidal recordings,
    and a calibration obtained by this platform method, gave tidal factors for the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). Comments on previous recordings
    are included.</p>"
