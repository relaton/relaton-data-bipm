abstract:
- content: "<p>A new moving mass calibration apparatus and process for LaCoste-Romberg
    feedback gravimeters are presented. The apparatus is based on the well-defined
    and relatively simple gravity field of a cylindrical mass. The main target of
    the new calibration apparatus was to reach a relative accuracy of 0,1% to 0,2%
    in the calibration of Earth tide registering gravimeters. The authors carried
    out a number of calibrations with the apparatus and report their results. They
    also investigated the effect of several external factors influencing the calibration
    process. Results so far confirm that the apparatus fulfils the original target.</p>"
