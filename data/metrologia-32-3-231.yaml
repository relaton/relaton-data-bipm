  content: "<p>Two Scintrex CG3M gravimeters were calibrated and compared with other
    relative meters (LaCoste-Romberg and Scintrex meters) at the fourth International
    Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters at Sèvres, France (30 May to 2 June 1994).
    LaCoste-Romberg meters were used as reference. Three main experiments were carried
    out at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. First, a calibration of
    the two Scintrex CG3M meters on a new baseline of five points, spanning a range
    of about 8 mGal. It is shown that both Scintrex meters provide results similar
    to within 0,005 mGal, even in noisy places, and that Scintrex results are similar
    to those of LaCoste-Romberg instruments to within an accuracy better than 0,010
    mGal. Second, measurements of vertical gradient at four points were carried out.
    The results for the Scintrex meters lie within 0,007 mGal/m and are similar to
    those of LaCoste-Romberg meters to within an accuracy of around 0,010 mGal/m.
    Third, a series of continuous records (each of about 10 minutes) was carried out
    with three LaCoste-Romberg and the Scintrex meters at four adjacent points. A
    repeatability of better than 0,005 mGal was obtained for one Scintrex meter. There
    is a difference of 0,010 mGal with LaCoste-Romberg data. These results confirm
    that the Scintrex meter is suitable for measuring small gravity differences, similar
    to those observed on active volcanoes.</p>"
