abstract:
- content: "<p>The overall uncertainty between the fixed points underlying the primary
    calibration of standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) may be described
    by terms, each of which is associated with the uncertainty at a given fixed point
    T<sub>j</sub>, within the sub-range covered by the calibration. Each term is calculated,
    using the appropriate deviation function ΔW(T), by imposing an uncertainty of
    value zero at the other fixed points. Deviation functions with a non-zero value
    of the deviation ΔW(T<sub>0</sub>) at the triple point of water, T<sub>0</sub>,
    are not defined in the ITS-90, since, nominally, ΔW(T<sub>0</sub>) = 0. For this
    reason the propagation of the uncertainty at T = T<sub>0</sub> is usually accounted
    for only indirectly through its contribution to the uncertainties δW(T<sub>j</sub>),
    where j ≠ 0. By slightly extending the current mathematical scheme within the
    formalism provided by the ITS-90 it is shown that the uncertainty δW(T<sub>0</sub>)
    at the triple point of water is also directly propagated.</p>"
