  content: "<p>The goal of good performance of a time scale from a small set of atomic
    clocks has been realized. This time scale is both synchronized to UTC within the
    internationally agreed goal of a few hundred nanoseconds and syntonized to the
    SI second to less than 1 × 10<sup>−13</sup>. This has been accomplished using
    an algorithm to combine the readings of the clocks in an adaptive way based upon
    their actual performance and by a smooth automatic steering operation to maintain
    synchronism with UTC. This time scale, <italic>UTC</italic>(INPL), is a virtual
    time scale, or software clock, and is expected to have the advantage over a single
    primary clock of being more robust, more reliable and more stable than any of
    its physical member clocks, and insensitive to environmental perturbations. International
    measurements and comparisons by the GPS common-view approach have validated the
    performance. The frequency stability σ<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>(τ) is less
    than 4 × 10<sup>−14</sup>. The software is PC-based and fully automatic. The concepts
    used in the generation of a virtual time scale are applicable to other areas of
    metrology and if incorporated could yield significant improvement in other international
    standards.</p>"
