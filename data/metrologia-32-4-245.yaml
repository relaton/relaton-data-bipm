abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of good performance of a time scale from a small set of atomic
    clocks has been realized. This time scale is both synchronized to UTC within the
    internationally agreed goal of a few hundred nanoseconds and syntonized to the
    SI second to less than 1 × 10<sup>−13</sup>. This has been accomplished using
    an algorithm to combine the readings of the clocks in an adaptive way based upon
    their actual performance and by a smooth automatic steering operation to maintain
    synchronism with UTC. This time scale, UTC(INPL), is a virtual time scale, or
    software clock, and is expected to have the advantage over a single primary clock
    of being more robust, more reliable and more stable than any of its physical member
    clocks, and insensitive to environmental perturbations. International measurements
    and comparisons by the GPS common-view approach have validated the performance.
    The frequency stability σ<sub>y</sub>(τ) is less than 4 × 10<sup>−14</sup>. The
    software is PC-based and fully automatic. The concepts used in the generation
    of a virtual time scale are applicable to other areas of metrology and if incorporated
    could yield significant improvement in other international standards.</p>"
