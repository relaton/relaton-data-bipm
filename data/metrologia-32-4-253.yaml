  content: "<p>The overall uncertainty between the fixed points underlying the primary
    calibration of standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) may be described
    by terms, each of which is associated with the uncertainty at a given fixed point
    <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, within the sub-range covered
    by the calibration. Each term is calculated, using the appropriate deviation function
    Δ<italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic>), by imposing an uncertainty of value zero
    at the other fixed points. Deviation functions with a non-zero value of the deviation
    Δ<italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>) at the triple point of water,
    <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>, are not defined in the ITS-90, since, nominally,
    Δ<italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>) = 0. For this reason the propagation
    of the uncertainty at <italic>T</italic> = <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> is usually
    accounted for only <italic>indirectly</italic> through its contribution to the
    uncertainties δ<italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>),
    where <italic>j</italic> ≠ 0. By slightly extending the current mathematical scheme
    within the formalism provided by the ITS-90 it is shown that the uncertainty δ<italic>W</italic>(<italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>)
    at the triple point of water is also <italic>directly</italic> propagated.</p>"
