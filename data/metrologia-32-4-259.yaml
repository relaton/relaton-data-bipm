  content: "<p>Measurements of the effective radiance temperature of a high-temperature
    graphite tube black-body furnace are compared with those calculated from two theoretical
    models. The first model extends the conventional annular zone model by including
    effects of vignetting and temperature gradients. Because the black-body surface
    is not a perfect diffuse reflector, this is found to be insufficiently accurate
    and a Monte-Carlo integration with a diffuse/Fresnel-specular surface model is
    presented, which gives good agreement with the measured data.</p>"
