  content: "<p>A new determination of the numerical value of the gravitational constant
    <italic>G</italic> was carried out by means of an apparatus consisting of a fibreless
    torsion balance which was carried by the buoyancy of a floater in a liquid; the
    angular deflection of the balance was compensated with the aid of a control loop
    and an electrostatic torque transmitter; the reacting bodies were cylinders. The
    result obtained for <italic>G</italic> differs from the CODATA value by about
    +6 Ã— 10<sup>-3</sup> in relative value. No dependence on the materials or on the
    distance between the cylinders was found. The apparatus is described, the methods
    of evaluation and the results are reported, the possible sources of errors are
    discussed.</p>"
