abstract:
- content: "<p>A new determination of the numerical value of the gravitational constant
    G was carried out by means of an apparatus consisting of a fibreless torsion balance
    which was carried by the buoyancy of a floater in a liquid; the angular deflection
    of the balance was compensated with the aid of a control loop and an electrostatic
    torque transmitter; the reacting bodies were cylinders. The result obtained for
    G differs from the CODATA value by about +6 Ã— 10<sup>-3</sup> in relative value.
    No dependence on the materials or on the distance between the cylinders was found.
    The apparatus is described, the methods of evaluation and the results are reported,
    the possible sources of errors are discussed.</p>"
