  content: "<p>The construction, performance and application of a 30 metre high mercury
    column is discussed. This thermostated, mercury-in-steel column is used to calibrate
    differential piston gauges up to about 300 MPa. The applied principle is the so-called
    cumulative method, introduced by Holborn and Schultze. Above 260 MPa the calibrations
    become problematical, probably due to a strong increase in viscosity of the pressure-transmitting
    oil. At pressures of about 161 MPa, 199 MPa and 248 MPa comparisons have been
    carried out with a Harwood controlled-clearance piston gauge. The relative differences
    in pressure are 12 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, 101 × 10<sup>-6</sup> and 28 × 10<sup>-6</sup>,
    respectively.</p>"
