  content: "<p>An analysis of calibration data suggests that <italic>W</italic><sub>ref</sub>(In)
    and <italic>W</italic><sub>ref</sub>(Ga), the resistance ratios at the freezing
    point of indium and the melting point of gallium, may have been assigned temperatures
    a fraction of one millikelvin higher and lower, respectively, on the ITS-90, than
    the values indicated by some high-purity samples. Illustrations are given of how
    the quality of calibration services can be assessed using issued calibration data.</p>"
