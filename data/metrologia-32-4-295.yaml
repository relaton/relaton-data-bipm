abstract:
- content: "<p>An analysis of calibration data suggests that W<sub>ref</sub>(In) and
    W<sub>ref</sub>(Ga), the resistance ratios at the freezing point of indium and
    the melting point of gallium, may have been assigned temperatures a fraction of
    one millikelvin higher and lower, respectively, on the ITS-90, than the values
    indicated by some high-purity samples. Illustrations are given of how the quality
    of calibration services can be assessed using issued calibration data.</p>"
