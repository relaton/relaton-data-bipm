  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A detailed description of the He-Ne/<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> laser
    wavelength standards developed at the National Metrology Institute of Turkey (UME),
    using high-frequency modulation and featuring a long-term relative instability
    of a few parts in 10<sup>14</sup>, is presented. The frequency dependence of the
    lasers on the iodine gas pressure, modulation width and saturating field intensity
    have been studied with a very low uncertainty level, and the common effect of
    these parameters on the output frequency has been demonstrated. A new method of
    accurately measuring modulation width has been realized, making an important contribution
    to the improvement of reproducibility of this type of wavelength standard. An
    international comparison between the laser standards of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the UME has been performed. Several iodine cells studied
    in a laser with an accurate servo-system, reveal a correlation between the spacing
    of the molecular resonances, the gas contamination in the iodine cell, and the
    output frequencies of the laser when locked to different iodine components.</p>"
