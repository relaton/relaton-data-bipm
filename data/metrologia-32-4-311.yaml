abstract:
- content: <p>Adopting the phrase "quantity of dimension one" instead of "dimensionless
    quantity" raises a number of questions. After recalling what underlies the concept
    of dimension, the respective merits and drawbacks of both phrases are reviewed
    and discussed. In conclusion the author would like to have the current phrase
    "dimensionless" maintained.</p>
