abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of the<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> stabilized
    lasers, used as wavelength standards and belonging to the National Metrology Institute
    of Turkey (UME) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), has
    been performed at the BIPM. A frequency stability of 45 Hz (a standard deviation
    for a series of measurements over four days at an averaging time of about one
    hour), or 1 part in 10<sup>13</sup>, has been achieved. This indicates significant
    progress in the stabilization of this type of frequency standard and establishes
    a new level for international comparisons at 633 nm. The frequency difference
    between the UME and the BIPM standards, which incorporate quite different laser
    components and iodine cells, has been found to be 0,7 kHz, much smaller than the
    reproducibility usually reported for this kind of laser standard. For the portable
    UME standard, the difference in frequencies found before and after the comparison,
    when measured against a stationary UME laser, was less than 3 Ã— 10<sup>-13</sup>.</p>"
