  content: "<p>The absolute density of pure water was determined with an accuracy
    better than 1 part in 10<sup>6</sup>. The method used was hydrostatic weighing
    in which a fused-quartz sphere, whose volume was measured by optical interferometry,
    was weighed in water. The density obtained in the hydrostatic weighing was corrected
    for impurity effects using differential densimetry and, using mass spectrometry,
    was further corrected for isotopic composition. A total of eighteen samples was
    measured using three spheres. The density of pure water at 16 째C (ITS-90) and
    0,101 325 MPa having isotopic composition equal to that of Standard Mean Ocean
    Water was found to be 998,9468 kg m<sup>-3</sup> with a combined standard uncertainty
    of 0,0006 kg m<sup>-3</sup>. The maximum density at about 4 째C, as calculated
    from our previous measurements of thermal expansion, was found to be 999,9756
    kg m<sup>-3</sup> with an uncertainty of 0,0008 kg m<sup>-3</sup>.</p>"
