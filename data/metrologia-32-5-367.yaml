  content: "<p>A measuring system based on digital compensators is described. This
    can be used to calibrate inductive voltage dividers (IVDs) at extremely low frequencies.
    The division error at 1 Hz expressed relative to the complex division factor <italic>D</italic>
    at 32 Hz was found to be 1,9 × 10<sup>-5</sup> in magnitude (uncertainty of measurement
    <italic>u</italic><sub>m</sub> = 1,2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and -7,8 × 10<sup>-5</sup>
    rad in phase (<italic>u</italic><sub>p</sub> = 6,5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> rad) for
    an IVD selected as an example. Additional characteristics such as the two-port
    parameters of the IVD can be measured by adding to the divider reference impedances
    in order to obtain a six-port network.</p>"
