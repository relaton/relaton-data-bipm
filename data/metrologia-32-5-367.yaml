abstract:
- content: "<p>A measuring system based on digital compensators is described. This
    can be used to calibrate inductive voltage dividers (IVDs) at extremely low frequencies.
    The division error at 1 Hz expressed relative to the complex division factor D
    at 32 Hz was found to be 1,9 × 10<sup>-5</sup> in magnitude (uncertainty of measurement
    u<sub>m</sub> = 1,2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and -7,8 × 10<sup>-5</sup> rad in phase
    (u<sub>p</sub> = 6,5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> rad) for an IVD selected as an example.
    Additional characteristics such as the two-port parameters of the IVD can be measured
    by adding to the divider reference impedances in order to obtain a six-port network.</p>"
