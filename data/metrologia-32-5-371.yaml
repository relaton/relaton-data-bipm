abstract:
- content: <p>A precision monochromatic thermometer was constructed using a linear
    array of silicon photodiodes that in connection with a grating monochromator acted
    as a wavelength-selective detector. The thermometer was used to realize the ITS-90
    between 962 °C and 2100 °C according to its formal definition. The estimated standard
    uncertainty (1σ level) in the scale realization ranged from 0,01 °C at 962 °C
    to 0,21 °C at 2100 °C. This scale was compared with the scale realized with the
    primary standard thermometer of the Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" using
    two pyrometric lamps as transfer sources. The average differences between the
    two scales obtained from three measurement runs did not exceed 0,13 °C and were
    within the combined uncertainties in the realization of the scales over all the
    interval from 962 °C to 2100 °C.</p>
