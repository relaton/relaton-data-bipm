abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of an international comparison of iodine-stabilized He-Ne
    lasers at λ ≈ 633 nm, made by beat-frequency techniques, between the CEM (Spain),
    the IPQ (Portugal) and the BIPM are presented. Four lasers took part in the ten-day
    period of measurements, and were compared once or twice a day. The frequency differences
    between the lasers were all less than 6 kHz and the highest standard uncertainty
    of the mean of the frequency differences between two lasers was 7 kHz. These results
    lie inside the standard uncertainty given in the mise en pratique of the definition
    of the metre. Parameters which affect the frequency of the lasers, such as modulation
    width, iodine pressure and laser power, were also investigated.</p>"
