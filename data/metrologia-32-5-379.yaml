  content: "<p>The results of an international comparison of iodine-stabilized He-Ne
    lasers at λ ≈ 633 nm, made by beat-frequency techniques, between the CEM (Spain),
    the IPQ (Portugal) and the BIPM are presented. Four lasers took part in the ten-day
    period of measurements, and were compared once or twice a day. The frequency differences
    between the lasers were all less than 6 kHz and the highest standard uncertainty
    of the mean of the frequency differences between two lasers was 7 kHz. These results
    lie inside the standard uncertainty given in the <italic>mise en pratique</italic>
    of the definition of the metre. Parameters which affect the frequency of the lasers,
    such as modulation width, iodine pressure and laser power, were also investigated.</p>"
