abstract:
- content: "<p>An on-site comparison of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) resistance standards
    of the Swiss Federal Office of Metrology (OFMET) and of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made in November 1994. Measurements of a 100 Ω
    standard in terms of R<sub>H</sub>(2), the quantized resistance corresponding
    to the quantum number 2, agreed to (9 ± 17) parts in 10<sup>10</sup>. Measurements
    of 10 000 Ω/100 Ω and 100 Ω/1 Ω ratios agreed to (0,8 ± 18) parts in 10<sup>10</sup>
    and (7,5 ± 27) parts in 10<sup>10</sup>, respectively.</p>"
