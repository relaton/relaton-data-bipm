abstract:
- content: "<p>The pressure coefficients of six 1 Ω Thomas-type resistance standards
    have been measured at the Norwegian Metrology and Accreditation Service (Justervesenet
    - JV). The typical value is 2 nΩ/hPa with a combined standard uncertainty of 0,05
    nΩ/hPa. To minimize temperature effects, the experiment was carried out at a temperature
    near the peak value of each resistor, 26,8 °C. This will also be the new JV maintenance
    temperature for 1 Ω Thomas resistance standards in the future.</p>"
