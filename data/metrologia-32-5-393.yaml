abstract:
- content: "<p>New measurements of the thermal expansion of the copper used to manufacture
    the VNIIFTRI gas thermometer were performed and the temperature scale was corrected.
    The deviations of recalculated T(gas) scale from the IPTS-68 scale and from the
    ITS-90 scale in the range 13 K to 308 K were found.</p>"
