abstract:
- content: "<p>Narrowband filter radiometers are being used in the development of
    a new method of irradiance scale realization at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST). To improve the accuracy of the current spectral-irradiance
    scale, we propose to eliminate several steps from the calibration process and
    to use the filter radiometers and a high-temperature black body in realizing the
    scale. Ultimately, the filter radiometers will be calibrated against a trap detector
    measured at the NIST High Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer, which maintains an expanded
    uncertainty at 633 nm of 0,0266% for a coverage factor of  k  = 2. In this work,
    the filter and detector were calibrated as a unit using the NIST Detector Comparator
    Facility, and the aperture areas were measured by flux comparison with a uniform
    source. Six filter radiometers covering the spectral range 350 nm to 1100 nm were
    used to measure a known irradiance source; the measurements agreed with predictions
    to within 1%. Comparisons were also conducted with three NIST standard photometers,
    and similar agreement was observed. Since the irradiance source and the photometers
    were calibrated using independent methods, our results not only verify the calibration
    of the filter radiometers but also imply that the NIST scales of spectral irradiance
    and illuminance are consistent. Future plans include characterization of a high-temperature
    black body and the calibration of quartz-halogen irradiance lamps using this black-body
    source.</p>"
