abstract:
- content: <p>The realization and dissemination of ultraviolet spectral responsivity
    scales at the 0,1% level require a solid-state detector with a predictable, and
    preferably an invariant, spectral responsivity. Unfortunately, the most widely
    used detectors for the ultraviolet, silicon photodiodes, have a spectral responsivity
    that varies rapidly in the ultraviolet due to multiple ionization and recombination
    effects. This paper describes the properties of alternative wide-bandgap photodiodes
    such as GaAsP and GaP, together with specially developed detectors based on SiC.
    These devices are "solar blind" to various degrees, thus offering significant
    advantages over silicon photodiodes in certain applications. Measured quantum
    efficiency for all these types of photodiode is presented, together with an evaluation
    of permanent and short-term changes in quantum efficiency of the detectors following
    exposure to UV radiation.</p>
