abstract:
- content: "<p>A detector calibration facility based on a rare gas ionization chamber
    has been built at the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Japan. We have realized a windowless
    system by applying strong differential pumping, which features no spectral limitation
    and easy gas handling. In the auto-ionization region near the xenon absorption
    edge, photon flux was found to be underestimated and this limited the maximum
    available wavelength to 92 nm. The uncertainty (1σ) for a Si photodiode calibration
    was estimated to be within ±9% in the wavelength range 10 nm to 92 nm.</p>"
