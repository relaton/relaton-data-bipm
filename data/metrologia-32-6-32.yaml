abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper gives the results of an indirect comparison of a cryogenic
    radiometer from the Institut National de Metrologie (INM), France, and from the
    Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) with a QED-200 from the Van Swinden
    Laboratorium (VSL), the Netherlands. This comparison was performed at a laser
    wavelength of 543,515 nm (in vacuum) and at a power level of 100 µW. If this QED-200
    is assumed to be stable with time, then two cryogenic radiometers of different
    design have been shown to agree to 3 × 10<sup>-5</sup> with an uncertainty 3 ×
    10<sup>-4</sup> at the 1σ level.</p>"
