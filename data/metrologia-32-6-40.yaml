abstract:
- content: "<p>The stability and reproducibility of secondary-standard sources and
    detectors are the main problems and the fundamental trouble of spectroradiometry
    in the ultraviolet spectral range. The high accuracy of the spectroradiometric
    unit for primary standards based on synchrotron radiation sources is lost by transferring
    that unit to unstable or irreproducible secondary standards. The best secondary-standard
    sources and detectors for units of spectral radiance, irradiance, radiant power
    and flux for the wavelength range 30 nm to 400 nm are described. Integral radiometers
    for different applications are presented.</p>"
