abstract:
- content: "<p>Radiometry based on black bodies remains one of the fundamental fields
    of radiometry. Black bodies are widely used as standard sources in radiometry
    of noncoherent optical radiation from the ultraviolet to the far-infrared spectral
    regions. Outstanding progress in radiometry has been made in the last decade due
    to development of high-precision cryogenic radiometers, which have made it possible
    to decrease the measurement uncertainty to 0,01%. New technology and optical physics
    call for significant improvement in the accuracy of black-body-based radiometry
    and the practical realization of spectral radiance and irradiance scales having
    an accuracy of 0,1%. However, the accuracy of black-body-based radiometry is now
    limited by the accuracy of thermodynamic temperature measurements of a radiating
    cavity. For example, the uncertainty of spectral radiance and spectral irradiance
    scales is from 0,5% to 1% in the UV due to uncertainties in pyrometric measurements.
    The required uncertainty of modern black-body-based radiometry is about 0,1%.
    This can be achieved by using the latest advances in the field of high-precision
    radiometric instrumentation, such as absolute radiometers, large-area high-temperature
    black bodies and synchrotrons.</p>"
