abstract:
- content: "<p>Electron storage rings are in use or planned for use in the extension
    of radiometry into ranges of higher photon energies, from the visible spectral
    region continuously to the x-ray region up to photon energies of at least 100
    keV. The storage rings serve as broadband primary standard sources for the development
    of a source-based radiometry and as sources of tuneable monochromatic photon fluxes
    for the development of a detector-based radiometry in combination with primary
    standard detectors. The state of the art is briefly summarized based on results
    obtained at the Berlin storage ring BESSY I (maximum electron energy 850 MeV),
    which was optimized for radiometry from the outset. Further progress in radiometry
    is expected at the future storage ring BESSY II (start of operation in 1998).
    At this third-generation storage ring (maximum electron energy 1,9 GeV) radiation
    from undulators, wigglers and wavelength shifters will be used for radiometry
    in addition to traditional synchrotron radiation from bending magnets. Furthermore,
    there are prospects at BESSY II to extend radiometry into the Î³-ray range with
    photon energies in the MeV region by scattering laser and undulator photons at
    stored relativistic electrons.</p>"
