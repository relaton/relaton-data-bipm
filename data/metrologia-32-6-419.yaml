  content: "<p>Electron storage rings are in use or planned for use in the extension
    of radiometry into ranges of higher photon energies, from the visible spectral
    region continuously to the x-ray region up to photon energies of at least 100
    keV. The storage rings serve as broadband primary standard sources for the development
    of a <italic>source-based radiometry</italic> and as sources of tuneable monochromatic
    photon fluxes for the development of a <italic>detector-based radiometry</italic>
    in combination with primary standard detectors. The state of the art is briefly
    summarized based on results obtained at the Berlin storage ring BESSY I (maximum
    electron energy 850 MeV), which was optimized for radiometry from the outset.
    Further progress in radiometry is expected at the future storage ring BESSY II
    (start of operation in 1998). At this third-generation storage ring (maximum electron
    energy 1,9 GeV) radiation from undulators, wigglers and wavelength shifters will
    be used for radiometry in addition to traditional synchrotron radiation from bending
    magnets. Furthermore, there are prospects at BESSY II to extend radiometry into
    the Î³-ray range with photon energies in the MeV region by scattering laser and
    undulator photons at stored relativistic electrons.</p>"
