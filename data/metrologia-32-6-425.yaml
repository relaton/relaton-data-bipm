  content: "<p>Improvements in synchrotron radiation and high-temperature black-body
    sources will provide a method of realizing scales of spectral radiance and irradiance
    with uncertainties comparable with those provided by absolute cryogenic radiometers.
    This paper discusses planned improvements in the synchrotron radiation facility
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and how these improvements
    can be exploited to accurately measure the temperature of a high-temperature black
    body developed at the All-Russian Research Institute for Optophysical Measurements
    (VNIIOFI), thus allowing substantial improvement in radiometric scales.</p>"
