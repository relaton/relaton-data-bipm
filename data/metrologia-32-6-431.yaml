abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper describes the stabilization and radiometric characterization
    of a Russian-made high-temperature black body. The black body is actively controlled
    at around 2500 K, emitting radiation which is stable in radiance to Â±0,01% at
    800 nm, over several hours. Techniques are described which show how the radiance
    of the black body can be maintained at a constant level from day to day. The techniques
    used to determine the absolute spectral radiance of the black body using a laser-characterized
    monochromator are also described.</p>"
