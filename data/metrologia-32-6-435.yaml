abstract:
- content: "<p>A radiometric method to measure high temperatures of black bodies using
    broadband-filter detectors is presented. Results of temperature measurements using
    a linear pyrometer and filter detectors, respectively, are compared. The performance
    of the black-body source and the realization of an interim detector-based spectralirradiance
    scale are described and discussed. The new scale is compared with the results
    of the 1990 Comité Consultatif de Photométrie et Radiométrie intercomparison of
    spectral-irradiance measurements.</p>"
