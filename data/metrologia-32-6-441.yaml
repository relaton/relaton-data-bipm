  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has developed a large-area
    black body (LABB) for accurate realization of the spectral irradiance in the red
    and near-infrared spectral range. Its temperature is measured by standard Pt-resistance
    thermometers according to the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).
    The black body consists of two concentric sodium heatpipes, the inner one with
    temperature stability of ±2 mK forming the radiating cavity. The relative uncertainty
    of the spectral irradiance of the LABB in the red spectral range is 6 × 10<sup>-4</sup>
    at the freezing point of silver, the largest contribution resulting from the thermodynamic
    uncertainty of the temperature scale. This allows the ITS-90 to be checked by
    a comparison of the LABB with a cryogenic radiometer using calibrated filter radiometers
    as transfer standards. The thermodynamic temperatures obtained in the range 660
    °C to 962 °C agree with <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> within the combined 1σ
    uncertainties.</p>"
