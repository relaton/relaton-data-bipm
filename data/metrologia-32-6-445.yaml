abstract:
- content: "<p>Freezing-point black bodies used as primary standards of spectral radiance
    at two national standards laboratories are directly intercompared for the first
    time. The spectral radiance ratio is directly measured for a copper freezing-point
    black body from the National Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM), Japan, and
    a gold freezing-point black body from the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST), USA. Narrowband spectral radiance measurements at five wavelengths
    between 546 nm and 878 nm show the NRLM copper to NIST gold freezing-point temperature
    interval to be 20,39 K ± 0,12 K (2σ), in good agreement with the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) value of 20,44 K, and comfortably within the
    combined uncertainties assigned to the realization of the ITS-90 from each source.</p>"
