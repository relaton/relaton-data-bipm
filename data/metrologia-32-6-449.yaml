  content: "<p>A comparison of the spectral-radiance scales of the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the All-Russian Research Institute for
    Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI) was carried out in 1989 and 1990. The spectral
    range of the comparison was between 240 nm and 2400 nm. The transfer standards
    were argon-filled tungsten ribbon filament lamps. The NIST/VNIIOFI agreement was
    0,5 % to 1 % in the 240 nm to 800 nm range, and better than 0,5% between 900 nm
    and 2400 nm. On average, the spectral radiances measured at the VNIIOFI were slightly
    higher than the NIST values.</p>"
