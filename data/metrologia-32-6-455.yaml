  content: "<p>A method of realizing the lumen on the basis of recent developments
    in the field of black-body design is proposed as an alternative to the traditional
    goniophotometric technique. It is shown that a precision, large-area, high-temperature
    black body (HTBB) operating at temperatures up to 3200 K could be used for the
    direct realization of the lumen.</p>"
