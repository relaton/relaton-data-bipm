abstract:
- content: "<p>The electron storage ring BESSY in Berlin is used as a primary standard
    source with a calculable spectral radiant power from the near-infrared to the
    x-ray region. In order to reduce the uncertainties of the realized radiant power
    scale, improvements have been made in the measurement of the electron beam current
    and in the instrumentation of the radiometry laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB). Diffraction at the stray light aperture stops in the beam
    line, stray light and fluorescence of the exit window were investigated in the
    visible. Thus, the spectral radiant power can now be realized with a relative
    uncertainty (1σ level) of 3 × 10<sup>-3</sup> at a photon energy of 15 keV in
    vacuum and of 8 × 10<sup>-4</sup> in the visible in air behind an exit window.
    To investigate the agreement with other well-established radiometric primary standards,
    BESSY was compared in the visible with the highly accurate laser-based cryogenic
    radiometer of the PTB Berlin, using two filter radiometers (centre wavelengths
    676 nm and 800 nm) as transfer standards. The results of four comparison runs
    confirm the uncertainty of the realized radiant power scale of BESSY in the visible.</p>"
