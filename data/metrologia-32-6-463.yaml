  content: "<p>The spectral responsivity scales of eighteen national standards laboratories
    have been compared within the wavelength range 250 nm to 1000 nm using two different
    types of silicon photodetector. Overall, good agreement was found between the
    scales of the participating laboratories, although some large deviations were
    also observed, especially in the ultraviolet.</p>"
