  content: "<p>Use of a transmission trap detector with four silicon photodiodes for
    absolute radiometry is described. The photodiodes are arranged in a three-dimensional
    array so that the small amount of light not absorbed after four reflections is
    transmitted in a direction coaxial with the input direction. The transmittance
    of the trap is measured for each application to determine the correction to the
    ideal photodetector response. Results at a wavelength of 633 nm show consistent
    power measurements for transmission losses in the range 0.3% to 3%, depending
    on the orientation of the trap detector relative to the polarization direction
    of the input beam. Trap power measurements are compared with a cryogenic radiometer.</p>"
