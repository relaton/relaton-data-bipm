  content: "<p>Narrowband filter radiometers are being used in the development of
    a new method of irradiance scale realization at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST). To improve the accuracy of the current spectral-irradiance
    scale, we propose to eliminate several steps from the calibration process and
    to use the filter radiometers and a high-temperature black body in realizing the
    scale. Ultimately, the filter radiometers will be calibrated against a trap detector
    measured at the NIST High Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer, which maintains an expanded
    uncertainty at 633 nm of 0,0266% for a coverage factor of <italic>k</italic> =
    2. In this work, the filter and detector were calibrated as a unit using the NIST
    Detector Comparator Facility, and the aperture areas were measured by flux comparison
    with a uniform source. Six filter radiometers covering the spectral range 350
    nm to 1100 nm were used to measure a known irradiance source; the measurements
    agreed with predictions to within 1%. Comparisons were also conducted with three
    NIST standard photometers, and similar agreement was observed. Since the irradiance
    source and the photometers were calibrated using independent methods, our results
    not only verify the calibration of the filter radiometers but also imply that
    the NIST scales of spectral irradiance and illuminance are consistent. Future
    plans include characterization of a high-temperature black body and the calibration
    of quartz-halogen irradiance lamps using this black-body source.</p>"
