abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental system using correlated photons for radiometric purposes
    has been set up at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
    We use pairs of correlated photons to produce spatial maps of the absolute efficiency
    of a photomultiplier photocathode at four wavelengths. We also compare this technique
    with measurements carried out by conventional means tied to existing radiometric
    standards. These initial comparisons show an average agreement within ~0,6% between
    the two methods. The results show that correlated photons can be a useful tool
    in radiometry and that the method holds enough promise to warrant further studies.</p>"
