  content: "<p>The polarization characteristics of a pn-junction Si photodiode and
    a Au-GaAsP Schottky photodiode which were revealed when the detectors were used
    obliquely to the incident radiation were investigated theoretically and experimentally
    in the spectral region from the vacuum ultraviolet to the visible. The experimental
    results in both cases were well explained by an optical model in the ultraviolet
    to the visible spectral range. It was found that the effect of beam divergence
    on the detector response could be negligible in the visible and resulted in a
    smaller response below about 90 nm for both the Si and the Au-GaAsP photodiode.
    The silicon photodiode showed complex spectral variation of polarization properties
    between 100 nm and 400 nm.</p>"
