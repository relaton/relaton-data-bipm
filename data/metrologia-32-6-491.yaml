abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance of high-resolution, fully depleted silicon detectors
    at low photon energies has been found to be dominated by incomplete charge collection
    due to the pn junction entrance window. Two alternative experimental methods to
    characterize this behaviour have been investigated by using monochromatized synchrotron
    radiation at the radiometry laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    with the electron storage ring BESSY: the measurement of the dc photocurrent relative
    to a calibrated diode and the measurement of the energydispersive response function
    in the single photon counting mode. Both methods are discussed and compared with
    a theoretical model including a microscopic description of the photoelectric absorption
    and a charge-collection probability function.</p>"
