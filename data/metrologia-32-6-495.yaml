abstract:
- content: "<p>Detector-based bandfilter radiometry has recently become increasingly
    popular in the fields of absolute spectral-irradiance measurements, black-body
    temperature determination and comparison with sourcebased measurements. This paper
    introduces an advanced data-reduction method which handles all bandfilter measurements
    together. An analytical function approximation is used on Planckian radiation
    multiplied by a polynomial emissivity.</p>"
