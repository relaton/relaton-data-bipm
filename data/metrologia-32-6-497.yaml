abstract:
- content: "<p>A detector spectral-responsivity scale based on the intrinsic properties
    of radiometric-quality photodiodes has previously been established over the wavelength
    range 400 nm to 900 nm. Work to extend this range into the ultraviolet below 400
    nm is now being carried out. The new scale, which covers the 250 nm to 900 nm
    range, can be held in new four-element and five-element trap detectors. The precision
    of the scale in the ultraviolet is limited principally by the greater variations
    - across the detector surface and from one detector to another - of the internal
    quantum efficiency at these wavelengths. The actual internal quantum efficiency
    of S1337-11 Hamamatsu photodiodes obtained by our measurements is compared with
    previous experimental and calculated values for the quantum yield of silicon in
    this wavelength region.</p>"
