abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports on an experiment performed at the Istituto Elettrotecnico
    Nazionale G. Ferraris (IEN), aiming at the production of biphoton fields by parametric
    scattering of light in a nonlinear crystal of lithium iodate. The blue line at
    457,9 nm from an argon laser is used as pumping radiation, thereby resulting in
    a fluorescence in the visible region with degenerate pairs of photons at about
    916 nm. These biphoton fields are well suited to the measurement of the quantum
    efficiency of photodetectors in the photon-counting regime and to the realization
    of an absolute source of radiation.</p>"
