  content: "<p>At the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt filter radiometers are
    used for the comparison of three primary radiometric standards, an electron storage
    ring, a black body of known temperature and a cryogenic radiometer. The calibration
    of the filter radiometers is performed in a two-step process. First, a trap detector
    is calibrated at the cryogenic radiometer at discrete laser lines. In the second
    step, this trap detector is used to calibrate the filter radiometers at a spectral
    comparator. Applying a correction for stray light, the responsivities of the filter
    radiometers can be measured over a dynamic range of more than eight decades in
    the wavelength range 420 nm to 1200 nm. To overcome drift effects of the interference
    filters, the filter radiometers were calibrated every night before and after an
    application. Following this procedure the responsivity was measured with a relative
    uncertainty of less than 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> at the 1σ level.</p>"
