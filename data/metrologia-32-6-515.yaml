abstract:
- content: "<p>A short-term effect of low-power ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the
    widely used Hamamatsu S1337 photodiode is investigated. Experiments show that
    such photodiodes exposed to 248 nm radiation exhibit a 0,6% increase in responsivity
    at this wavelength, and a smaller increase at longer wavelengths. The increase
    is produced during the first tens of seconds of exposure and the new value reached
    by the responsivity remains stable even after further irradiation. The effect
    strongly depends on the wavelength of the radiation but is independent of power
    level within the measurement range of 8 µW to 50 µW. The surface reflectivity
    of the photodiode is not modified, indicating that radiation directly affects
    the internal quantum efficiency. It thus seems advisable to age this type of photodiode
    before calibration or simply to avoid any exposure to radiation below 300 nm.</p>"
