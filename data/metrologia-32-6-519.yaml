  content: "<p>The realization of a new detector-based ultraviolet spectral-radiance
    scale is presented. The paper describes the characterization of an interference
    filter radiometer centred at 358 nm and its use to determine a point on the spectral-radiance
    scale with an uncertainty at 1Ïƒ of 0,7%. A comparison of this new scale point
    with the current UK National Physical Laboratory radiance scale is also presented.</p>"
