  content: "<p>A few years ago, we compared for the first time the World Radiometric
    Reference, which is used as reference for meteorological radiometry, and the Système
    International (SI) radiometric scale realized at the National Physical Laboratory
    with cryogenic radiometers. We present an improved comparison which used as transfer
    standard a trap detector calibrated to the NPL primary standard cryogenic radiometer.
    As a realization of the World Radiometric Reference, we used an electrical substitution
    radiometer traceable to the WRR and used in solar radiometry. The method of transfer
    has been improved and the results confirm those of the first comparison but with
    much lower uncertainty.</p>"
