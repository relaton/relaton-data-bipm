abstract:
- content: "<p>A Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) for the wavelength region between
    1100 nm (cut-off wavelength of the Si photodiode detector) and 190 nm (absorption
    edge of air) has been developed for use in spectral-irradiance comparisons. The
    main advantages of the FTS over traditional spectroradiometers based on a monochromator
    are: (i) high light throughput; (ii) circular entrance aperture; (iii) high wavelength
    accuracy; and (iv) multiplex advantage if the detector is the dominant source
    of noise. The main problems encountered in achieving highly accurate irradiance
    comparisons are discussed. The uncertainties due to the size of the source are
    studied. It was found that sources with a diameter of up to 20 mm can be compared
    with an uncertainty of 2,5% between 1100 nm and 250 nm, and 3% below 250 nm. In
    the case of a homogeneous radiance distribution the uncertainty is below 1,5 %.</p>"
