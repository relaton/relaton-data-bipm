abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper reviews some of the advances in optical radiation measurements
    made over the last twenty years, particularly through the use of cryogenic radiometers
    and solid-state detector transfer standards. The way in which base scales of many
    optical radiation measurements are linked and the prospects for a further improvement
    in accuracy, particularly by the measurement of sources using well-characterized
    filter radiometers, are discussed.</p>"
