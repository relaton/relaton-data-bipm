abstract:
- content: "<p>An Oxford Instruments Radiox cryogenic radiometer was recently installed
    at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The first measurements
    were aimed at characterizing the performance of the system. The Radiox was then
    compared with the cryogenic radiometer of the French Institut National de Métrologie
    (INM), a CRI LaseRad, at the BIPM by successive measurements of the power in a
    laser beam at two wavelengths: 647 nm and 476 nm. The radiometers differed in
    these measurements by 1,9 parts in 10<sup>4</sup>, the uncertainties in each being
    smaller than 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>"
