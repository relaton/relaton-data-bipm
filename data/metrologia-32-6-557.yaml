abstract:
- content: "<p>Absolute cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometers (ESRs) are widely
    used in many applications of absolute radiometry and are accepted today as being
    the most accurate instruments for radiant-power measurements. An absolute cryogenic
    electrical-substitution radiometer has been developed at the All-Russian Research
    Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI) as the radiometric standard
    of Russia. The design and characterization of the VNIIOFI absolute cryogenic radiometer
    currently used for the calibration of detectors in Russia is described. This radiometer
    uses laser radiation and a power level of 1,3 mW and achieves an uncertainty of
    0,02%. The factors limiting the overall uncertainty of the VNIIOFI cryogenic radiometer
    are also analysed.</p>"
