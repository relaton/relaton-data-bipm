abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes the approach used to realize the candela from
    illuminance measurements made with a large-area, partial-filtering photometer.
    The methods followed to determine the absolute responsivity at 555 nm, traceable
    to an absolute cryogenic radiometer, and to measure the relative spectral responsivity
    are discussed, including the uncertainty values of the measured quantities. Finally,
    preliminary results obtained on comparing the photometer measurements with the
    previous luminous intensity scale are presented.</p>"
