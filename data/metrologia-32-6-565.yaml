  content: "<p>A facility is being set up at the National Research Council of Canada
    for the monochromator-based spectral calibration of transfer standard radiometers
    using a cryogenic absolute radiometer. General design features and target performance
    of the new apparatus are discussed. The sources of error inherent to detector
    calibrations performed using monochromator-based sources are analysed in some
    detail, with special attention devoted to bandwidth errors, polarization effects
    and the effect of the angular subtense of the beam. Some detector effects, such
    as spatial uniformity and temperature dependence, are also discussed. A status
    report is given on the development of the new cryogenic radiometer facility.</p>"
