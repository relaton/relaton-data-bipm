  content: "<p>In the radiometry laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB) at the Berlin electron storage ring BESSY, a new cryogenic electrical-substitution
    radiometer with a cavity absorber is now in operation as the primary detector
    standard for the vacuum-ultraviolet spectral range. The instrument is optimized
    for use with narrowband synchrotron radiation, as dispersed by a monochromator.
    It is capable of measuring spectral radiant powers of a few microwatts with a
    resolution of 1,5 nW and a relative uncertainty of 0,2%. The cryogenic radiometer
    has been employed at a new detector-calibration facility for the normal-incidence
    spectral range. Calibrations of Hamamatsu S1337 and G1127 photodiodes have been
    performed in the 170 nm to 500 nm spectral range with a relative uncertainty of
    the spectral responsivity less than 1%. At four laser wavelengths, agreement was
    found with a calibration against the laser-operated cryogenic radiometer of the
    PTB at Berlin.</p>"
