  content: "<p>An optical system is proposed that reduces the background thermal radiation
    input to a cryogenic radiometer by a factor of almost 40000. This system is based
    on a concave grating which can be configured to create a scanning monochromator
    with the cryogenic radiometer entrance aperture as the exit slit. A cryogenic
    radiometer is described that has a sensitivity of 1 pW and which is suitable for
    use with this monochromator and a continuum source to calibrate detectors at an
    uncertainty level of one part in 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>"
