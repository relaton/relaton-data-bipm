  content: "<p>The use of a mode-locked laser as a source for high-accuracy calibration
    of transfer standards to a cryogenic radiometer is discussed. The critical issue
    is the relative response of the transfer standard to the modelocked laser light
    as compared with continuous-wave laser light. As a first test, we have measured
    the linearity of the response of silicon photodiode light-trapping detectors using
    mode-locked laser light at a wavelength of 532 nm.</p>"
