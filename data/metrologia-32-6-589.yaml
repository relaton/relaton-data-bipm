  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) operates at the electron
    storage ring BESSY a calibration facility for the normal incidence spectral region
    which can be used for measurement of the spectral radiance of transfer standards
    such as deuterium lamps and tungsten ribbon lamps. Because BESSY is not a standard
    of spectral radiance, radiation fluxes are compared and the area of the transfer
    source under investigation is determined by imaging the source on to a precisely
    measured aperture which acts as an entrance slit of the monochromator. Polarization
    effects are determined by rotating the complete calibration facility around the
    axis of the incoming radiation. Relative uncertainties of 2 % (1 Ïƒ) for the spectral
    radiance are achieved, with the main contributions arising from inhomogeneity
    of the focusing mirror, geometry and alignment.</p>"
