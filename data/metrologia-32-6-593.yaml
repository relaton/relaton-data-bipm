abstract:
- content: <p>"Solar blind" photoelectric sensors made of metal-coated insulators
    have been developed for measuring intense ultraviolet-C radiation. In these detectors,
    ultraviolet radiation induces the photoemission of electrons from a semitransparent
    metal photocathode into an insulator. In contrast to Schottky photodiodes, the
    metal coating has to generate an accumulation layer in the insulator at the interface.
    Pure synthetic sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and crystalline magnesium
    oxide (MgO) have been used as insulating materials because they have proved to
    be thermally and photochemically stable over wide ranges of temperature and UV-C
    irradiance. For potential differences of a few hundred volts across the insulator,
    photocurrents of order 1 µA to 10 µA have been measured at wavelengths below 250
    nm and 340 nm, respectively.</p>
