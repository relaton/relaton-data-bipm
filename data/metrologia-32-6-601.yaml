abstract:
- content: "<p>Sources of intense ultraviolet (UV) radiation are increasingly used
    in industry, for sterilization of air and water, photolithography, printing, etc.
    However, the damaging nature of intense UV makes the accurate measurement of the
    spectral characteristics of intense UV sources extremely difficult. For this reason,
    the National Physical Laboratory is currently developing a new spectroradiometer,
    designed specifically for the characterization of sources of this type. An important
    early stage in the design of this facility was an investigation into the ageing
    effect produced by intense UV radiation on the materials being considered for
    use in the spectroradiometer optics. This involved the measurement of the spectral
    reflectance of mirror coatings and diffusely reflecting materials before and after
    irradiation. Xenon and mercury discharge lamps were used to provide UV irradiance
    levels at about the 50 mW m<sup>-2</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup> level and above, between
    200 nm and 400 nm. This paper presents the results obtained from this investigation.</p>"
