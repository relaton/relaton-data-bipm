  content: "<p>The spectral-irradiance scale in the infrared at the National Research
    Council of Canada is being realized using electrical-substitution absolute radiometers
    in conjunction with interference filters to calibrate FEL tungstenhalogen lamps
    as primary source standards. This paper discusses some preliminary measurements
    associated with the second phase of this work, the realization of a scale in the
    range 1500 nm to 2400 nm. Some characteristics of the spectroradiometer that will
    be used to measure the transmittance of the interference filters under conditions
    as close as possible to the final configuration are presented. Various problems
    encountered in configuring the liquid-nitrogen-cooled InSb detector used are discussed.
    The larger effect of atmospheric water absorption bands in this wavelength range
    presents a greater challenge in determining the choice of passband wavelengths
    for the filters. Measurements to determine the extent of these absorption bands
    are presented.</p>"
