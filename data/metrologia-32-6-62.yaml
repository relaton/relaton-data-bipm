abstract:
- content: "<p>The present solar ultraviolet (UV) monitoring network of the Finnish
    Meteorological Institute consists of seven sites equipped with erythemally-weighted
    broadband radiometers. Two of the sites are also equipped with a Brewer spectroradiometer.
    The Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety is responsible for testing
    and calibration of the broadband radiometers. An Optronic 742 spectroradiometer
    is used as a reference instrument, and the broadband radiometers are calibrated
    against the Optronic 742 in solar radiation. The Optronic 742 is calibrated against
    1000 W FEL lamps traceable to the NIST. The errors caused by nonideal radiometric
    characteristics of the Optronic 742 are numerically corrected. The uncertainty
    (2 σ) of solar UV measurements with the Optronic 742 is estimated to be ±8 % at
    310 nm and the uncertainty of the spectroradiometric solar calibration of the
    Solar Light Model 501 radiometers is estimated to be 11 %.</p>"
