abstract:
- content: "<p>The goal of the Low-background Infrared (LBIR) calibration facility
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology is to provide the infrared
    user community with a calibration base for broadband and spectral radiant power
    measurements. The LBIR facility began broadband radiant-flux calibrations of infrared
    sources in 1990 using a cryogenic vacuum chamber to provide the low background
    at 20 K. A second cryogenic-vacuum chamber is being brought into service for spectral
    calibrations in the LBIR facility. This new spectral calibration chamber will
    house the spectral instrument and be the centre for the spectral calibrations
    of sources and detectors and for the measurement of optical properties of materials.
    The LBIR spectral instrument is composed of a KRS-5 prism predisperser for order-sorting,
    followed by a grating monochromator. This calibration capability is currently
    being developed in three areas: spectral calibration of infrared detectors for
    use in low-background applications; spectral resolution of radiation from black-body
    sources such as cavities and other geometries such as spheres and plates; and
    characterization of optical components of interest to the community such as filters
    and window materials. This work will be carried out over the spectral range 2
    µm to 30 µm.</p>"
