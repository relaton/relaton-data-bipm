abstract:
- content: "<p>A wall-stabilized arc source is being investigated as a radiometric
    source for the near- and mid-infrared spectral range. This arc is similar to the
    argon mini-arc, which has been used as a radiometric source in the ultraviolet.
    The potential usefulness of the arc in the infrared (IR) range stems from its
    high brightness in this region. The arc has been tested as a source for a recently
    constructed facility for calibrating IR detectors. Over the range 3 µm to 11 µm,
    the signals with this source were greater by a factor of 6 to 17 than the signals
    from a 1500 K ceramic element, despite the beam from the arc being smaller in
    angular extent. The radiance of the source was calibrated from 1,6 µm to 10,6
    µm via a 1140 K black body. Over most of this spectral range the radiance of the
    arc is equal to that of black bodies ranging in temperature from 5000 K to 10000
    K. From 1 µm to 3 µm, a spectral scan with relatively high resolution shows a
    spectrum dominated by strong Ar I line emission. Finally, measurements were made
    of radiance as a function of arc current and translational position of the source.</p>"
