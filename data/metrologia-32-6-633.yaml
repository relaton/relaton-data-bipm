  content: "<p>A solar backscatter ultraviolet experiment flies regularly on the Space
    Shuttle to help validate and maintain the calibrations of several satellite-borne
    stratospheric ozone monitoring instruments. The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet
    (SSBUV) programme incorporates multiple radiometric standards and redundant calibration
    checks which have allowed the tracking of long-term changes in the calibration
    of the SSBUV instrument to within 1% over six flights. The reduction of uncertainties
    in SSBUV wavelength calibration has recently been emphasized because of an increasing
    need to improve precision and accuracy. Therefore, selected solar spectral features
    are now used to monitor intra- and inter-flight changes in that wavelength calibration.
    The results of applying this technique to the six SSBUV Shuttle missions are presented,
    together with a comparison of these results with results from two traditional
    approaches in which laboratory and on-board spectral line sources, respectively,
    are used to determine and monitor the SSBUV wavelength scale. Long-term wavelength
    calibration change is less than 0,02 nm, and intra-flight wavelength change is
    0,05 nm or less.</p>"
