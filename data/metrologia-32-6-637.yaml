  content: "<p>Traditional radiance calibrations of solar backscatter ultraviolet
    (SBUV) instruments require a measurement of the bidirectional-reflectance distribution
    function (BRDF) of a flat-plate diffuser. To date the BRDF of the diffusers used
    for calibrating the Shuttle-borne SBUV instrument (SSBUV), has relied on an initial
    measurement of a sample plate coated with BaSO<sub>4</sub> made by the National
    Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST). Changes in the reflectance of the
    calibration diffusers were tracked over time with measurements of their total
    hemispherical reflectance. Preliminary comparisons of direct measurements of the
    BRDF using a new facility at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, inferred BRDF
    values using an integrating sphere, and the NIST-based values, show significant
    inconsistencies. In general, direct measurements of BRDF values compare to within
    1% of those inferred from integrating sphere measurements. However, these values
    differ from the NIST-based values by about 6%. These differences and their uncertainties
    are discussed. The results imply that SSBUV-measured vertical ozone profile values
    have an altitude-dependent error of between 3% and -12%, but there should be little
    effect on the measured total ozone values.</p>"
