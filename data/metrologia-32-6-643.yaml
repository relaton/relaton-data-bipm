abstract:
- content: "<p>The X-ray Multi Mirror (XMM) satellite mission is one of the major
    European Space Agency (ESA) space missions scheduled for launch by the end of
    this decade. Its goal is to observe the x-ray-emitting sky in the 100 eV to 15
    keV photon energy range with high spectral and spatial resolution. XMM's scientific
    instruments consist mainly of three independent Wolter telescopes each having
    an imaging charge-coupled-device (CCD) detector in the focal plane. Two of the
    three telescopes are equipped with CCDs based on the conventional MOS-CCD technology.
    The third is equipped with pn-CCDs, a new developement of the semiconductor laboratory
    of the Max-Planck-Institut fur extraterrestrische Physik. The pn-CCD has several
    features such as full detector depletion, parallel readout and good radiation
    hardness due to the replacement of the MOS structures with pn-diode electrodes.
    The design of the pn-CCD detector for XMM is shown and measurements with pn-CCD
    prototype units are presented.</p>"
