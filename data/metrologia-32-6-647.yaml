abstract:
- content: "<p>The Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer (CDS) to be flown aboard the ESA/NASA
    Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) is designed to probe the solar atmosphere
    through the detection of spectral emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
    wavelength range 15 nm to 80 nm. By observing the absolute and relative radiance
    of selected lines and line profiles, we will be able to derive temperature, density,
    flow and abundance information for the plasmas in the solar atmosphere. Spatial
    and temporal resolutions of down to a few arcseconds and 1 second, respectively,
    allow such studies to be made within the fine-scale structure of the solar corona.
    Simultaneous coverage of large-wavelength bands provides the capability for simultaneously
    observing the properties of plasmas across the wide temperature ranges of the
    solar atmosphere. The pre-launch calibration is achieved through the use of a
    hollow cathode discharge source which is used as a transfer standard to allow
    calibration of the CDS against the primary standard of the BESSY electron storage
    ring in Berlin. The transfer source provides a radiation source of calibrated
    radiant flux stable to a few percent. By the use of different selected gases in
    the discharge tube, each of the detector wavelength intervals in the CDS can be
    covered adequately. The pre-delivery calibration of the CDS has been performed
    and some results are shown.</p>"
