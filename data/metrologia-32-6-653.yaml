abstract:
- content: "<p>Two sunphotometers with three channels at 862 nm, 500 nm and 335 nm
    were operated in space for eleven months on board the European Retrievable Carrier
    (EURECA). Both instruments experienced substantial losses of sensitivity, although
    the second instrument was exposed 100 times less than the first one. After retrieval
    of EURECA, the instruments were examined and optically tested. Contamination and
    degradation of optical components were found, but only small changes in spectral
    bandpasses.</p>"
