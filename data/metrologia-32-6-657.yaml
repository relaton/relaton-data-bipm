  content: "<p>The Ground Calibration Unit (GCU) is described. The GCU uses a solar-illuminated
    diffuser as calibration source. The absolute radiance of the diffuser is calculated
    from its absolute reflectivity and the incoming solar irradiance. The GCU was
    used to calibrate the on-board lamp sources of the flight model 1 of the Scanner
    for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) instrument in February 1993.</p>"
