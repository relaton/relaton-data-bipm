  content: "<p>The Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) instrument
    on board the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) has measured solar ultraviolet
    spectral-irradiance values since October 1991. The calibration and tracking methods
    are described. The intensity values have a precision of 1% at wavelengths longer
    than 200 nm. Short-term ultraviolet (UV) variability is correlated with other
    chromospheric indices at wavelengths shorter than 280 nm. At longer wavelengths,
    this correlation changes gradually into an anticorrelation. There exists a long-term
    solar-cycle component at all wavelengths, which seems to be independent of the
    rotational modulation. The variability in the integrated UV from 110 nm to 300
    nm amounts to 33% of the variability in the total solar irradiance.</p>"
