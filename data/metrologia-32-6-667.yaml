  content: "<p>A new stereo-spectral-imaging system, ARGUS, has been developed for
    the Mars 94/96 mission and consists of three videospectrometers with a wide field-of-view
    covering the spectral range 320 nm to 5200 nm. The on-board radiometric calibration
    is based on a diffusing target illuminated by the Sun's radiation. The provision
    for a common target for all the videospectrometers of the ARGUS system allows
    an intercomparison of instruments to be carried out in addition to individual
    calibration verification. The development and testing of the target for on-board
    radiometric calibration is described and techniques for preparing the target surface
    are given. A brief description of the setup for measurements of the spectral and
    angular response of the target reflectivity is presented, together with results
    of the spectral and angular response of the target reflectivity, for an angle
    of incidence of -70° (relative to the normal) and at viewing angles from 0° to
    +60° at 2° intervals. The bidirectional reflectance factor of the target is reported
    for the spectral range 320 nm to 5200 nm at an angle of incidence of -70° and
    at a viewing angle of +20°.</p>"
