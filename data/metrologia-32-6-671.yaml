  content: "<p>Two models of spaceborne radiometers for measuring atmospheric radiation
    at the Earth's limb radiance profiles have been designed in Estonia and used aboard
    several Russian orbital stations from 1971 to 1993. Calibration was carried out
    with a Teflon flat-plate diffuser and a DXW lamp traceable to the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) and an integrating sphere with a 1,2 m diameter
    and an 0,4 m aperture. The absolute spectral radiance of the aperture was determined
    by comparison with a tungsten ribbon standard lamp, calibrated at the All-Russian
    Research Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI), Moscow. The field-of-view
    responsivity was investigated by using a special collimator facility. The following
    characteristics of the spaceborne radiometers were determined: absolute responsivity
    constant, spectral characteristics, field-ofview responsivity and off-axis rejection,
    amplitude transfer function (nonlinearity) and temperature dependence of responsivity.
    The in-flight checking of long-term responsivity changes was carried out by using
    internal reference lamps and radiation from the Moon and the Sun.</p>"
