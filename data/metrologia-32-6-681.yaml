abstract:
- content: "<p>New luminous-intensity scales have been developed in Finland and Sweden
    based on silicon trap detectors having responsivities compared with an absolute
    cryogenic radiometer at a wavelength of 543,516 nm. The low reflectance of the
    trap device makes it possible to use a V(λ) filter in conjunction with the trap
    where the filter is separately characterized in transmittance. The new scales
    were compared with the scale currently in use in Sweden, which is based on incandescent
    lamps calibrated by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The
    agreement of the scales is generally within ±1%. The Finnish scale was typically
    0,2% to 0,6% below the BIPM-based scale, and the trap-based scale of Sweden is
    typically 0% to 0,5% below the BIPM-based scale when compared at a measurement
    distance of 4 m. Different sizes of aperture and different distances to the source
    showed variations up to ±1%. The transmittances of the V(λ) filters were measured
    separately by the two institutes and showed an agreement better than 0,1% in the
    colour-correction factor.</p>"
