  content: "<p>In photometry the unit of luminous flux is realized as total luminous
    flux of reference lamps. Goniophotometry enables a fundamental realization by
    a direct derivation from the luminous intensity unit. The new calibration method
    uses one lamp as transfer standard for both units. Then, the ratio (unit steradian)
    of total luminous flux and luminous intensity (in a specified direction) is a
    characteristic property of the lamp. Its value is determined with a goniophotometer
    as weighted solid angle from normalized photocurrents and angular relations. Goniophotometric
    results are thus only affected by the uncertainty of the spatial integration,
    which makes the weighted solid angle a good measure to compare mechanics and method
    of goniophotometers. Finally, the luminous flux value is calculated as the product
    of the weighted solid angle, determined by goniophotometry, and the luminous intensity
    value assigned to the lamp. At the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB),
    a goniophotometer with a maximum diameter of 6 m is planned as a combination of
    service robots. One robot aligns the lamp centred in and directed to the instrument's
    coordinate system. The surrounding space is divided into two parts, each with
    a separate robot to move a detector continuously on a path with dynamically adjusted
    location, direction and speed, optimized to obtain minimum uncertainty of the
    goniophotometric measurement.</p>"
