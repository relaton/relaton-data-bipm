abstract:
- content: "<p>We have developed measurement systems for radiometric realization of
    the units of luminous intensity and illuminance. The advantages of the trap-detector-based
    systems include a low level of detector-filter interreflections and good spatial
    homogeneity. Evaluation of known uncertainty components gives a total uncertainty
    of 0,6% (2 σ).</p>"
