  content: "<p>The stability of luminous intensity and colour temperature of modified
    FEL-type, 1000W quartz-halogen lamps has been tested at various colour temperatures
    to investigate the suitability of these lamps for use as photometric transfer
    standards. During 60 h of operation at 2856 K, after seasoning for 100 h, the
    changes of luminous intensity of these lamps were 0,2% to 0,6%, and the changes
    of colour temperature were less than 2 K. The changes in relative spectral power
    distributions (normalized at 550 nm) over the 60 h of operation were within 0,5%
    in the visible region. The FEL-type lamps operated at 2856 K showed satisfactory
    stability within the limited duration of these tests. Characteristics of the lamps
    have also been investigated for operation at 2000 K to 3100 K, for reversed polarity,
    and for long-term storage.</p>"
