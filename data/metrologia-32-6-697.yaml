abstract:
- content: "<p>The study of ultraviolet effects on the biosphere requires an accurate
    knowledge of UV-B irradiances reaching the Earth's surface. Here we present the
    technical specifications and the performance of a spectroradiometer for the highly
    accurate determination of actual UV levels. The sensitivity, the spectral resolution
    and the wavelength accuracy of the instrument, as well as results from a series
    of intercomparisons, justify use of the term ''highaccuracy''. Spectroradiometric
    measurements made with our instrument in Germany and New Zealand show that the
    decreasing stratospheric ozone levels in both hemispheres, and the increasing
    tropospheric ozone levels in Germany, have led to significant differences in UV-B
    radiation between Germany and New Zealand. The ratios of the weighted irradiances
    range from 1,5 to 2, depending on the biological weighting function, in clear-sky
    summer conditions. A comparison of spectral UV measurements in Germany between
    1992 and 1993 showed enhanced levels of UV-B radiation in the late spring and
    early summer of 1993 caused by reduced total ozone columns. The monthly averaged
    total ozone columns in 1993 were the lowest since ozone levels were systematically
    recorded in Germany. The data also show that UV-A radiation was lower in 1993
    than in 1992, due to differences in cloudiness between the two years.</p>"
