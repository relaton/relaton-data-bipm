abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the main problems of natural radiation measurements, especially
    for ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, is the calibration and quality control of the
    radiometers used. We have developed a simple radiometer which allows the comparison
    of other radiometers, spectroradiometers and light sources. The filter radiometer
    consists of a Spectralon diffuser, interference filters, a silicon photodiode
    and signal amplification. The peak wavelengths of the thirteen interference filters
    are distributed between 301 nm and 1040 nm. The measurements of the UVB edge of
    the solar spectrum require very stable filters with a small half-width (FWHM).
    We used five special UVB filters with a FWHM of about 1 nm. The transfer radiometer
    has a dynamic range of 10<sup>8</sup>; its resolution is better than 1 part in
    10<sup>4</sup> and the smallest detectable spectral irradiance is 1,2 Ã— 10<sup>-9</sup>
    W cm<sup>-2</sup> nm<sup>-1</sup> at 305,48 nm. Using this transfer radiometer,
    we compared four different irradiation sources: two 1 kW FEL lamps (a PTB- and
    a NIST-based standard), one 200 W deuterium lamp (PTB-related standard) and the
    primary standard irradiation source BESSY. It was found that the deviation between
    the four radiation sources was in agreement with the standard deviation of each
    irradiation source.</p>"
