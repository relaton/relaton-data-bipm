  content: "<p>The integrated emissivity is computed for an isothermal cavity whose
    surface deviates from Lambertian. To simulate the non-Lambertian surface the reflected
    radiant distribution is assumed to be given by a function of the incident and
    reflected angles. Numerical calculation is carried out for lidless cylindro-conical
    cavities with a surface emissivity of 0,9. For long cavities with a nearly specular
    surface, integrated emissivity is high, independent of the distance between the
    cavity and a detector, and for nearly diffuse surfaces it increases with distance.
    When the distance is infinite the extent of deviation from Lambertian makes less
    difference.</p>"
