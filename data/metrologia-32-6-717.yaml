abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper deals with the various problems involved in the development
    and calibration of an absolute standard laser power meter, covering the range
    10 W to 50 W, based on an unusual approach to the widely employed method of electrical
    substitution. The key element is a symmetrical transducer acting as an automatic
    power balance.</p>"
