abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper presents a simple method for compensating the phase change
    of light reflected at a gauge block. This is done by measuring the gauge block
    from the rear of a glass base plate with which it was placed in optical contact
    for the interferometric calibration. The length of the gauge block can be determined
    accurately since the method compensates for errors such as those due to bending
    of the base plate and variations in oil film thickness in wringing the gauge block
    to the base plate.</p>"
