  content: "<p>A tabulation of calculations, made by different groups, of the hyperfine
    structure and hyperfine constants of various ro-vibrational transitions in the
    B-X system of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> is presented. Constants are listed for
    the following radiations: 502 nm, 515 nm, 532 nm, 543 nm, 576 nm, 589 nm, 605
    nm, 612 nm, 633 nm, 640 nm, 657 nm and 793 nm; 1,28 µm and 1,34 µm.</p>"
