  content: "<p>A new method for measuring long gauge blocks using a fringe-counting
    interferometer with a 633 nm wavelength-stabilized He-Ne laser is described. Two
    subgauge blocks, which have V-type graduation lines covered with glass plates,
    are optically contacted with both sides of a long gauge block. They are handled
    with bare hands and the surfaces of the glass plates are wiped with a paper towel
    after the optical wringing procedure. Using the National Research Laboratory of
    Metrology 2 m line standard automatic measuring machine, several gauge blocks
    up to 1 m long are measured with a repeatability less than 0,1 µm in standard
    deviation. A comparison between the lengths of gauge blocks measured by the new
    method and by the conventional excess fractions method is made. The results show
    that the length of gauge blocks up to 1 m can be determined with an expanded uncertainty
    <italic>U</italic> = 0,3 µm, corresponding to a level of confidence of about 95
    %.</p>"
