abstract:
- content: "<p>Marcarino and Bassani have proposed the sodium liquid-vapour equilibrium
    as a means to approximate the ITS-90 between 660 °C and 962 °C with an accuracy
    of about 10 mK. We have also measured the sodium vapour pressure over this temperature
    range using a pressure-controlled heat pipe. Our results differ from those of
    Marcarino and Bassani by approximately 34 mK at 660 °C and 21 mK at 962 °C with
    a linear temperature dependence of the difference between these values. This relationship
    may be explained very satisfactorily by a difference in the impurity content of
    the two samples. We show that an additional 200 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mass fraction
    of potassium in our sample as compared with theirs is sufficient to explain the
    discrepancy. As sodium of sufficient purity to ensure repeatability of its use
    as a temperature standard at the millikelvin level is not commercially available,
    it appears necessary to characterize the pressure/temperature relationship for
    each sample prior to relying on a measurement of the pressure to determine the
    temperature of the heat pipe. The alternative is to rely on the heat pipe as an
    intercomparison device with the temperature given by a calibrated thermometer.</p>"
