  content: "<p>Causes of uncertainties in temperature measurements are analysed. Some
    uncertainties are intrinsic to the temperature scale itself (built-in uncertainties).
    The rest are due to an assortment of experimental uncertainties. A simplified
    calibration procedure is proposed in the temperature range 0 °C ⩽ <italic>T</italic>
    ⩽ 660 °C that reduces the time (and thus the cost) of calibration by about 30%
    without a significant change in the accuracy of the scale imprinted on the calibrated
    platinum resistance thermometers.</p>"
