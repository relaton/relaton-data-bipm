  content: "<p>Roundness profiles are compared which were obtained from measurements
    carried out at five national metrology laboratories. The object used for this
    comparison was a zirconium-oxide sphere with a profile containing higher harmonics
    and a total roundness deviation of about 42 nm. The measurement results were obtained
    using different and independent measuring instruments and different evaluation
    methods for spindle error separation. The number of data points used ranged from
    50 to 4096. Before the analysis, the profiles were transformed to a common digital
    data format containing 1024 points and a correlation analysis was carried out
    to determine a common zero position for the profiles. In the analysis, standard
    deviations and maximum deviations were calculated from point-by-point differences
    of the profiles with reference to one another or to the average profile. Fourier
    analysis was used to select a spectral area for an analysis at the edge of the
    significance limit. The comparison shows that each participating laboratory is
    able to measure a roundness profile with a standard deviation in each data point
    of less than 2 nm.</p>"
