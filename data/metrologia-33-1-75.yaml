abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparisons of the 1 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) were made with those of the Korea Research
    Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Taejon, Korea, in January 1995, the
    Measurement Standards Laboratory of the New Zealand Institute for Industrial Research
    and Development (MSL), Lower Hutt, New Zealand, in March 1995, and the National
    Measurement Laboratory (NML/CSIRO), Sydney, Australia, in April 1995. The results
    agree within an overall uncertainty of less than 1 nV.</p>"
