  content: "<p>A procedure for simultaneously obtaining values of the thermal conductivity
    and thermal diffusivity of liquids by the transient hot-wire (THW) method is described.
    The practical model of the THW method is described by a transfer function having
    a feedback loop. All transient data obtained by integration during a finite interval
    were assigned to a particular instantaneous time. The concept of the reflectivity
    of a thermal wave at a container wall was also investigated. The capability of
    the system, including the computing algorithm, was confirmed by measuring the
    thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of toluene and n-heptane within the
    temperature range 0 °C to 50 °C at atmospheric pressure using two hot-wire cells
    under different configurations of bridge-circuit (constant-voltage or constant-current
    sources). Furthermore, heat capacities were derived from both thermal properties
    and densities, and the consistency of the measurements was examined. Empirical
    equations representing thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of both toluene
    and n-heptane were derived as functions of temperature. The uncertainty of coefficients
    derived from the thermal conductivity equation is estimated to be 0,4 % to 0,5
    % (with a coverage factor <italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic> = 2 (i.e. <italic>p</italic>
    = 95 %)), whereas that for thermal diffusivity is about 4 % (<italic>k<sub>p</sub></italic>
    = 2).</p>"
