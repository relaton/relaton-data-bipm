  content: "<p>Drift of emf in bare-wire, base metal thermocouples is linked to the
    precipitation of alloying components that supersaturate the host (Ni) lattice.
    Using a simple phenomenological description, one can visualize the process of
    precipitation from supersaturated solid solutions. Some possible reasons for the
    changes in alloy composition in metal sheathed thermocouples are suggested.</p>"
