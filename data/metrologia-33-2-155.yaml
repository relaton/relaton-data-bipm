  content: "<p>We have investigated large systematic errors, exceeding several parts
    in 10<sup>8</sup> (several tens of microgals), in absolute gravity measurements
    with the aim of reducing the differences in measured gravity values obtained by
    different kinds of absolute gravimeter. We find that rotation of a falling object
    around a horizontal axis may be induced by small differences in the moment of
    release of the object from its points of support. This may lead to a large systematic
    error which seems to be common to all types of absolute gravimeter. We propose
    a simple model for the rotation of the falling object which may be applied to
    all kinds of absolute gravimeter and predict errors of as large as 10<sup>-6</sup>
    ms<sup>-2</sup> (100 ÂµGal) which are confirmed by experiment. To reduce the error
    it is necessary to minimize both the area of the contacting surface and the stress
    applied to it. It is also necessary to monitor the rotation of the falling object
    in order to show that there is no systematic error in measured gravity values.</p>"
