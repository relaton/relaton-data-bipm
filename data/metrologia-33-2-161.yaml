  content: "<p>We have compared the Josephson array voltage standard (JAVS) held by
    the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR) with that
    of the Danish Institute of Fundamental Metrology (DFM). The comparison took place
    in Singapore from 20-25 March 1995. A commercial Zener reference voltage standard
    was used as transfer instrument between the two laboratories. The result of the
    comparison was an observed difference of 13 nV with a combined uncertainty of
    9 nV. The difference was independent of several measurement configurations used.</p>"
