  content: "<p>The paper describes the results of a comparison of two primary low-pressure
    standards, (i) the Ultrasonic Interferometer Manometer (UIM) and (ii) the Static
    Expansion Apparatus (SEA), maintained at the National Physical Laboratory (NPLI),
    India. The comparison was carried out by employing a capacitance diaphragm gauge
    (CDG) of 1333 Pa full-scale range as the transfer standard over the pressure range
    1 Pa to 1000 Pa. For pressures of 20 Pa and above, the values of the calibration
    factor of the CDG obtained on the SEA deviate 0,10 % from the values by the thermal
    transpiration equation and this deviation increases to over 0,4 % for pressures
    lower than 20 Pa. For the UIM, the deviation is found below 0,05 % at pressures
    of 100 Pa and above, but increases to 0,8 % for pressures as low as 1 Pa. The
    comparison (i) establishes the mutual compatibility of the two primary standards
    in the region of pressure overlap and (ii) sets limits to the uncertainty of measurements
    made on the two systems, which are 0,2 % at 1000 Pa and 1,0 % at 10<sup>-4</sup>
    Pa for the SEA and 0,0014 % at 1000 Pa and 1,4 % at 1 Pa for the UIM.</p>"
