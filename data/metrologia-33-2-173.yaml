  content: "<p>A comparison of iodine cells used to stabilize helium-neon lasers was
    carried out by three standards laboratories, the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM), the National Measurement Laboratory (NML/CSIRO), Australia,
    and the Measurement Standards Laboratory (MSL) of the New Zealand Institute for
    Industrial Research and Development. The frequencies produced by any of the cells
    in any of the lasers at each laboratory agreed to within 1 part in 10<sup>11</sup>
    (4,7 kHz).</p>"
