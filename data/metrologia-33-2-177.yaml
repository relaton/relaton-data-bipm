abstract:
- content: "<p> The direct comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM) of the BIPM cryogenic radiometer (Radiox) with a mechanically cooled cryogenic
    radiometer (MCR) from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is described. The
    radiometers were compared using a laser beam at λ = 647 nm with power levels of
    400 μW and 650 μW. They were found to be in good agreement, as the measured difference
    in responsivity was found to be 1,5 parts in 10<sup>5</sup>, with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 8 parts in 10<sup>5</sup>.</p>"
