  content: <p>To monitor the stability of the kilogram a total uncertainty not exceeding
    1 to 2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> is required. Although a comparison of "mechanical"
    and "electrical" energy by the superconducting magnetic levitation method is viable
    in principle for this purpose, a more elaborate design of electromechanical system
    for levitation is required. A design for the system based on a combination of
    flat elements is suggested. The single element takes the form of a flat rectangular
    coil, produced by photolithography, and a superconducting plane located near and
    parallel to the coil. The characteristics of the element have been calculated
    in two versions. The first is meant for use in levitation, the second as part
    of a magnetic guide.</p>
