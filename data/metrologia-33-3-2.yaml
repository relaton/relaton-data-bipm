abstract:
- content: "<p>The primary purpose of the comparison was to establish the equivalence
    of the calibration of infrared radiation thermometers within Europe in the temperature
    range 800 °C to 2000 °C. Seven EU national metrological institutes (NMIs) participated.
    The equivalence of calibrations was determined by circulating a transfer standard
    infrared radiation thermometer between the participating laboratories. The calibrations
    obtained were compared with the reference calibration performed by the co-ordinating
    laboratory (National Physical Laboratory). It was found that, after correction
    for the size-of-source effect, the calibrations of the participating laboratories
    nearly all agree to better than 0,1 % of temperature.</p>"
