  content: "<p>The sensitivity of a series of silicon trap detectors has been measured
    as a function of beam polarization. Measurements and numerical simulation show
    that very small departures from the ideal orientation of the photodiodes mounted
    in the trap induces a significant sensitivity to the state of polarization of
    the beam. Consequences of this polarization dependence for the use of trap detectors
    as transfer detectors in high-accuracy applications, particularly in cryogenic
    radiometry, are discussed.</p>"
