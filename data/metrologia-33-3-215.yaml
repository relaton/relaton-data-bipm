abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we present results of international comparisons of fixed-point
    cells of some of the defining fixed-point materials of the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990. These comparisons involved cells from seven national laboratories,
    although in some cases only one type of fixed-point material was compared. Except
    for silver cells, the agreement among cells of the same defining fixed-point material
    from the various laboratories was to within 1 mK. The expanded uncertainties (k
    = 2) of the comparison measurements were 12 µK for Ga, 18 µK for H<sub>2</sub>O,
    27 µK for Sn, 35 µK for In, 37 µK for Zn, 42 µK for Al, and 55 µK for Ag.</p>"
