  content: "<p>The CS3, a primary atomic clock with a vertical caesium beam of the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, has been in operation since autumn 1992.
    A type B evaluation of its uncertainty was performed and a combined standard uncertainty
    of 14 × 10<sup>-15</sup> was obtained. The clock can now, together with others,
    be used to realize International Atomic Time.</p>"
