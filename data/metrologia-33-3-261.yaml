  content: "<p>The unified atomic mass unit and the mole are closely related. It is
    increasingly important in mass spectroscopy for it to be clearly understood that
    the definition of the unified atomic mass unit involves <sup>12</sup>C atoms which
    are unbound, at rest and in their ground state. There is some confusion as to
    whether this is indeed the case - although this is undoubtedly so. The reasons
    for this confusion are discussed and a simple solution is proposed.</p>"
