abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements of the isotopic composition of water used in the production
    of triple point of water cells show that state-of-the-art triple point realizations
    must consider corrections and uncertainties due to variations in the isotopic
    composition of water. Triple point cell production processes yield cells with
    triple point temperatures 60 µK below that implied by the definition, with a similar
    sized uncertainty in the value. The use of isotopically impure water for the triple
    point leads to a fundamental uncertainty in the definition of the kelvin of around
    14 µK because of the equilibrium isotope fractionation between the ice and liquid
    water in the triple point cell.</p>"
