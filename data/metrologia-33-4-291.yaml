abstract:
- content: <p>Recent findings in precision platinum resistance and radiation thermometry
    at the Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" are described. Two issues concern
    high-temperature platinum resistance thermometers. The first is the use of gas-controlled
    heat pipes for comparing these thermometers and the development of a novel approach
    to improve temperature stability and uniformity. The second deals with observations
    made at the freezing point of silver which suggest that humidity may lead to electric
    leakage. In radiation thermometry the main recent achievement has been the use
    of a photodiode-array thermometer to realize the ITS-90 above the silver point.
    Relative to single-detector thermometers, this new thermometer offers several
    advantages that are related to its spectral characteristics. Another issue of
    importance is the size-of-source effect (SSE). Practical rules for minimizing
    SSE errors in interlaboratory comparisons are given.</p>
