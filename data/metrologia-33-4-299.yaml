  content: '<p>A brief summary is given of the developments in optical techniques
    for rapid temperature measurement during the last three decades in two national
    laboratories, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the USA and
    the Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" in Italy. Results of research conducted
    in originating and advancing the state-of-the-art in high-speed (millisecond-
    and microsecond-resolution) pyrometry for measurement of temperatures in the range
    1000 K to 5000 K are discussed. The main emphasis is on several key issues related
    to high-speed pyrometry including: high-speed operation, calibration of pyrometers,
    determination of true temperature and high-temperature reference points. Anticipated
    future directions in research, developments and applications in high-speed pyrometry
    are briefly discussed.</p>'
