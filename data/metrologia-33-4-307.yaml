abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured the vapour pressure of caesium over the temperature
    range 370 °C to 660 °C using a pressure-controlled heat pipe. The equation log
    (p/Pa) = a + b/T + c log(T/K) + dT + eT<sup>2</sup> with the coefficients a =
    34,573 234, b = -4979,5799 K, c= -9,323 424 7, d = 4,473 313 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup>
    K<sup>-1</sup> and e = -8,684 092 × 10<sup>-7</sup> K<sup>-2</sup> fits the data
    to within ±8 mK over the entire range. In addition, the non-uniqueness of the
    ITS-90 appears to be less than ±1,5 mK over the same temperature range based on
    the data from three thermometers.</p>"
