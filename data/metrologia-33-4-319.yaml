abstract:
- content: "<p>The freezing temperature of a pure substance varies with pressure.
    In the case of a vertical solid/liquid interface as in a typical thermometric-quality
    freezing-point cell, where the hydrostatic pressure increases with the depth along
    the interface, successful tracking of the associated temperature gradient by an
    immersed platinum resistance thermometer is an accepted criterion for ensuring
    that the sensor is in adequate thermal equilibrium with the interface. In practice,
    however, the sensor is at a finite distance from the interface because the thermometer
    stem that contains the sensor is inside a thermometer well that is immersed in
    the solid or liquid phase. In consequence, it is the temperature gradient along
    the boundary between the well and the adjacent phase that is measured rather than
    that along the interface. The two gradients are not necessarily identical; we
    wish to determine whether the difference between them is sufficiently large that
    account should be taken of it in applying the criterion. In this paper we analyse
    numerically the heat flow in the adjacent phase so as to obtain an estimate of
    the difference between these gradients. It turns out that the temperature distribution
    is independent of the thermal conductivity of the substance. The difference between
    the two gradients is computed to be non-zero, but so small as to be irrelevant
    in practice.</p>"
