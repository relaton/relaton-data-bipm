abstract:
- content: "<p>Since Johnson's experimental observations of thermal noise in 1927,
    and Nyquist's explanation of the phenomenon shortly afterwards in 1928, thermal
    noise has attracted interest as a means of measuring temperature. The independence
    of the thermal noise from the material nature of the sensor makes it particularly
    attractive for metrological applications. However, the noise signals are extremely
    small and some ingenuity is required to make accurate measurements. This paper
    reviews the foundations of Johnson noise thermometry and the various techniques
    that have been employed to measure temperature via Johnson noise. Emphasis is
    placed on key developments in noise thermometers for metrological applications.
    The review includes the current activities of teams involved in noise thermometry
    research.</p>"
