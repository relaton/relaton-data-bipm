  content: "<p>A newly developed Au/Pd thermocouple has shown very high reproducibility
    and good immersion characteristics. A stability test of the Au/Pd thermocouple
    has been conducted for 1000 h at 1000 °C in air to assess its suitability for
    practical application. Two thermocouples from two manufacturers were fabricated
    and their emf values were checked in a silver freezing-point cell before and after
    the soaking at 1000 °C. It was found that the high-temperature stability of the
    Au/Pd thermocouple is within ±30 mK (2σ) throughout the test time. This result
    implies that the Au/Pd thermocouple possesses characteristics which may make it
    suitable for use as a secondary high-temperature thermometer in industry.</p>"
