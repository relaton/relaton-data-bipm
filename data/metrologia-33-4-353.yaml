  content: "<p>The ITS-90 realized using high-temperature standard platinum resistance
    thermometers (HTSPRTs) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) was compared
    with the radiance temperature scale obtained using the NPL primary pyrometer.
    The scales were compared in the range 600 °C to 962 °C. The results show that
    the two scales generally agreed to within 2σ (about 0,1 °C) of the total combined
    uncertainty of the measurements, with the majority of the measurements agreeing
    to within 1σ. The ITS-90 value of the freezing point of silver, measured relative
    to that of aluminium, is confirmed within the uncertainty of the measurement.</p>"
