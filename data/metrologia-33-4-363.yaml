abstract:
- content: "<p>Most of the ITS-90 temperature fixed points are established by the
    melting or freezing of a specified substance. The question which may be asked
    is how closely this definition leads to a temperature value corresponding to the
    ideal thermodynamic state of the phase change temperature of a substance containing
    a small amount of impurities. In the light of experiments performed in the low
    temperature range it seems possible to use a calorimetric method to realize the
    temperature fixed points closer to the thermodynamic definition than by using
    the actual ITS-90 definition. This technique could lead to a more reliable (or
    more reproducible) temperature and could be a worthwhile improvement of the ITS-90.</p>"
