  content: "<p>This paper describes the realization of the International Temperature
    scale of 1990 from 1,2 K to 2473 K at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM),
    China, and gives the uncertainties in each range of the scale. Results of recent
    research in thermometry at the NIM are also reported. The non-uniqueness of SPRTs
    over the temperature range 13 K to 419 C and the nonlinearity of radiation thermometers
    have been investigated at the NIM. The results of international comparisons of
    the triple points of water and freezing points of silver between the NIM, the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, and the Nederlands
    Meetinstituut (NMi), the Netherlands, are presented.</p>"
