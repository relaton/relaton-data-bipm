abstract:
- content: "<p>The principles of total radiation thermometry as a method of primary
    thermometry are presented. Their practical application using a cryogenic radiometer
    is described with an account of the principal sources of uncertainty. It is shown
    that an uncertainty of about 0,3 mK may now be expected in the measurement of
    T in the room temperature range if advantage is taken of new commercial black
    surface preparations and new ideas in the design of black-body enclosures. Included
    also are comments on the use of the same equipment for a determination of the
    Stefan-Boltzmann constant with an estimated uncertainty approaching 1 part in
    10<sup>5</sup>.</p>"
