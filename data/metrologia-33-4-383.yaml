abstract:
- content: "<p>The ITS-90 is defined in the ranges 0,65 K to 3,2 K and 1,25 K to 5,0
    K by the vapour-pressure/ temperature relations of<sup>3</sup>He and<sup>4</sup>He,
    respectively. An apparatus has been constructed at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) for realizing the ITS-90 below 84 K which includes cells
    for realizing the ITS-90 through vapour-pressure thermometry with<sup>3</sup>He
    and<sup>4</sup>He. We present here the results of our realizations with He vapour
    pressures. The expanded uncertainties (k = 2) of the ITS-90 temperature realizations
    are 0,12 mK or less over 97% of the ranges of the ITS-90 definitions. In the lower
    3% of each range, the uncertainties of the realizations increase to 0,14 mK for<sup>3</sup>He
    and 0,16 mK for<sup>4</sup>He because of the growing size of the thermomolecular
    pressure correction. Comparisons are made with the previous wire scale of the
    NIST, which is traceable to the T<sub>X1</sub> and NPL-75 scales. Also presented
    are the results from direct comparisons of<sup>3</sup>He and<sup>4</sup>He realizations
    between 1,25 K and 3,2 K; these show the non-uniqueness of the ITS-90 in this
    region to be less than 0,3 mK.</p>"
