  content: "<p>The ITS-90 is defined in the ranges 0,65 K to 3,2 K and 1,25 K to 5,0
    K by the vapour-pressure/ temperature relations of <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He,
    respectively. An apparatus has been constructed at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) for realizing the ITS-90 below 84 K which includes cells
    for realizing the ITS-90 through vapour-pressure thermometry with <sup>3</sup>He
    and <sup>4</sup>He. We present here the results of our realizations with He vapour
    pressures. The expanded uncertainties (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the ITS-90 temperature
    realizations are 0,12 mK or less over 97% of the ranges of the ITS-90 definitions.
    In the lower 3% of each range, the uncertainties of the realizations increase
    to 0,14 mK for <sup>3</sup>He and 0,16 mK for <sup>4</sup>He because of the growing
    size of the thermomolecular pressure correction. Comparisons are made with the
    previous wire scale of the NIST, which is traceable to the <italic>T</italic><sub>X1</sub>
    and NPL-75 scales. Also presented are the results from direct comparisons of <sup>3</sup>He
    and <sup>4</sup>He realizations between 1,25 K and 3,2 K; these show the non-uniqueness
    of the ITS-90 in this region to be less than 0,3 mK.</p>"
