  content: "<p>The triple points of water, mercury and gallium are realized, mainly
    for the calibration of capsule-type thermometers, by a calorimetric method using
    platinum cells for water and mercury, and a small glass cell for gallium. Their
    molar impurities are estimated from the relation between the melting temperatures
    and the inverses of the fraction of melt. Almost all the samples show linear relations.
    For water, the values at 1/<italic>F</italic> = 0 of all the samples agree to
    within ±0,1 mK and, for mercury, the values of two samples are within ±0,05 mK.
    It is pointed out that the platinum cell is available for water and mercury, but
    is unsuitable for gallium.</p>"
