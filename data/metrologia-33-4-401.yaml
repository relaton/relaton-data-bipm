  content: "<p>The vapour-pressure versus temperature equations for liquid <sup>4</sup>He
    and <sup>3</sup>He that define the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90)
    in the range 0,65 K to 5,0 K have been derived from earlier equations in the Echelle
    Provisoire de Temperature de 1976 (EPT-76), which span the wider range 0,2 K to
    5,2 K. This paper investigates the extent to which, i.e. to within what uncertainty,
    the equations can be obtained from thermodynamic calculations using the most recent
    <italic>pVT</italic> and thermal data for the liquid and gas phases of <sup>4</sup>He
    and <sup>3</sup>He. Regarding the <sup>3</sup>He vapour-pressure equation, the
    paper is an extension to higher temperatures of the paper by Fellmuth and Schuster
    which treated the important region below 1,5 K. The paper also deals with vapour
    pressures near the <sup>4</sup>He Î»-transition and near the critical points.</p>"
