abstract:
- content: "<p>The vapour-pressure versus temperature equations for liquid<sup>4</sup>He
    and<sup>3</sup>He that define the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90)
    in the range 0,65 K to 5,0 K have been derived from earlier equations in the Echelle
    Provisoire de Temperature de 1976 (EPT-76), which span the wider range 0,2 K to
    5,2 K. This paper investigates the extent to which, i.e. to within what uncertainty,
    the equations can be obtained from thermodynamic calculations using the most recent
    pVT and thermal data for the liquid and gas phases of<sup>4</sup>He and<sup>3</sup>He.
    Regarding the<sup>3</sup>He vapour-pressure equation, the paper is an extension
    to higher temperatures of the paper by Fellmuth and Schuster which treated the
    important region below 1,5 K. The paper also deals with vapour pressures near
    the<sup>4</sup>He Î»-transition and near the critical points.</p>"
