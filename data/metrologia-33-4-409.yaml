abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) was defined,
    there have been a number of significant developments in thermodynamic thermometry.
    New results have been published and further experiments are in progress or are
    planned. This special issue of Metrologia provides an appropriate occasion to
    review these developments. The new results show some differences between the ITS-90
    and thermodynamic temperature, but they are generally within one standard uncertainty
    of the values assigned in the ITS-90. Only in the region of 150 K have larger
    differences been reported. Further results must be awaited before firm conclusions
    regarding a new consensus for thermodynamic values can be drawn.</p>"
