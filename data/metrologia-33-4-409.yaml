  content: "<p>Since the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) was defined,
    there have been a number of significant developments in thermodynamic thermometry.
    New results have been published and further experiments are in progress or are
    planned. This special issue of <italic>Metrologia</italic> provides an appropriate
    occasion to review these developments. The new results show some differences between
    the ITS-90 and thermodynamic temperature, but they are generally within one standard
    uncertainty of the values assigned in the ITS-90. Only in the region of 150 K
    have larger differences been reported. Further results must be awaited before
    firm conclusions regarding a new consensus for thermodynamic values can be drawn.</p>"
