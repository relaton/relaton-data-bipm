  content: "<p>The realizations of the fixed points of the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) maintained in Canada and Mexico were compared between -38
    °C and 420 °C, using a portable fixed-point realization apparatus. In this range,
    the routinely realized defining fixed points of the ITS-90 in these countries
    were found to coincide to within 0,5 mK.</p>"
