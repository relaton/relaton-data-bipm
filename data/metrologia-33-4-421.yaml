abstract:
- content: "<p>Double freezing curves of oxygen have been obtained in a cooling process
    with a rate of less than 40 mK/min. The plateaus of these double freezing curves
    show differences in temperature and width. The cause of the observed double freezing
    curve is presumably redistribution of impurities into relatively pure and impure
    regions by transportation during the slow cooling process. This separation is
    observed in the melting curve of oxygen using both continuous and pulse heating
    methods. We note the importance of impurity redistribution on the accuracy of
    the temperature measurement and the realization of the triple point of oxygen.</p>"
