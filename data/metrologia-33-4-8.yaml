abstract:
- content: "<p>Primary dielectric constant gas thermometry (DCGT) has been used to
    establish a quasi-continuous temperature scale in the range 4,2 K to 27,0 K with
    a measurement uncertainty which increases with rising temperature from 0,6 mK
    to 1,2 mK (confidence level 95%). (It should be noted that previous papers refer
    to the 68% level which yields about one half of the uncertainty values.) The large
    number of experimental data for<sup>4</sup>He (about thirty isotherms, more than
    200 triplets of pressure, temperature, and dielectric constant) allowed, furthermore,
    the determination of the temperature dependencies of the second and third virial
    coefficients, without any constraints. The virial coefficients thus obtained exhibit
    good agreement with data based primarily on conventional gas thermometry and potential
    calculations. The established temperature scale is compared with the isotherm
    and constant volume gas thermometry scale NPL-75. A flat sinusoidal form for the
    differences between the two scales may be seen, which is in accordance with other
    published data. However, the differences are well within the thermodynamic uncertainties
    estimated for the NPL-75 and the DCGT scale. This result supports the theoretical
    polarizability value with a relative combined uncertainty of 6 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup>,
    i.e. the bounds for the polarizability value of<sup>4</sup>He have been decreased
    by one order of magnitude compared with the available rigorous theoretical bounds.</p>"
