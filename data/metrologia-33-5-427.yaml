  content: "<p>Based on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), this
    paper gives an extrapolation formula: <italic>W</italic>*<sub>Al</sub> = 2,193
    711 W<sub>Zn</sub> - 1,193 711 <italic>W</italic><sub>Sn</sub>. By this formula,
    the standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) can be used to measure temperature
    in the range 419,527 °C to 660,323 °C and the formula can be determined from just
    the calibration values at the triple point of water and the freezing points of
    Sn and Zn, which are convenient to realize. Fifty SPRTs have been used to check
    the formula for the range 0 °C to 660,323 °C. The extrapolation error is less
    than 7,0 mK in the range 419,527 °C to 660,323 °C. The precision of the formula
    is sufficient for secondary measurement.</p>"
