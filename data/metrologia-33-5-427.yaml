abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), this
    paper gives an extrapolation formula: W*<sub>Al</sub> = 2,193 711 W<sub>Zn</sub>
    - 1,193 711 W<sub>Sn</sub>. By this formula, the standard platinum resistance
    thermometer (SPRT) can be used to measure temperature in the range 419,527 °C
    to 660,323 °C and the formula can be determined from just the calibration values
    at the triple point of water and the freezing points of Sn and Zn, which are convenient
    to realize. Fifty SPRTs have been used to check the formula for the range 0 °C
    to 660,323 °C. The extrapolation error is less than 7,0 mK in the range 419,527
    °C to 660,323 °C. The precision of the formula is sufficient for secondary measurement.</p>"
