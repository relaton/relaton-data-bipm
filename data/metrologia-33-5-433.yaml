  content: "<p>The conventional industrial practice to correct (recalibrate) measuring
    instruments according to a fixed schedule (calibration interval) may waste money
    when the schedule is too tight or may provide a false sense of control when the
    schedule is too relaxed. Also, this approach may not generate data on real-time
    measurement errors that are crucial to draw management's attention to measurement
    concerns. We propose that the measurement process be interrupted according to
    an economically sensible schedule to check (interim test) the real-time errors
    with well-characterized check standards. When the observed error with the check
    standard exceeds an economic control limit, the measuring instrument should be
    corrected; otherwise correction is not needed. The proposed approach to limit
    the uncertainty of a measurement process is simple, sensible and generic. More
    important, it saves money by limiting the loss due to measurement error and the
    cost of control.</p>"
