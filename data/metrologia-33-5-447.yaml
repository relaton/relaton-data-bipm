abstract:
- content: <p>The isotopic composition of atomic nitrogen and its molar mass (numerically
    equal to its atomic weight) M(N) were re-measured using recently improved accurate
    gas isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We found in one sample of pure nitrogen,
    M(N) = 14,006 721 4 g mol<sup>-1</sup> with a combined uncertainty u<sub>c</sub>
    = 0,000 001 8 g mol<sup>-1</sup> (an average of four partially independent values).
    Another sample, atmospheric nitrogen, similarly from four values, yielded M(N)
    = 14,006 727 8 g mol<sup>-1</sup> with u<sub>c</sub> = 0,000 001 5 g mol<sup>-1</sup>
    corresponding to an isotope substance ratio n(<sup>14</sup>N) /n(<sup>15</sup>N)
    = f(<sup>14</sup>N)/f(<sup>15</sup>N) = 271,87 with u<sub>c</sub> = 0,11. The
    latter is in good agreement with the currently accepted IUPAC value of 272,0 with
    u<sub>c</sub> = 0,3. The measurements were carried out by means of the same rigid
    measurement procedures and instrumentation which are used in the isotopic measurements
    for ongoing redeterminations of the Avogadro constant. Although the measurements
    were not calibrated against synthetic N-isotope mixtures, the results compare
    favorably, within quoted uncertainties, with those selected by the International
    Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as the hitherto "best measurements
    from a specific source" and those representative of terrestrial compositions.
    They suggest a new standard of reliability for molar-mass determinations. They
    also establish the best realization so far of traceability of nitrogen isotopic
    measurements to the mole in the Système International d'Unités (SI), as well as
    to the Avogadro constant.</p>
