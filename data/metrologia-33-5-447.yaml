  content: <p>The isotopic composition of atomic nitrogen and its molar mass (numerically
    equal to its atomic weight) <italic>M</italic>(N) were re-measured using recently
    improved accurate gas isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We found in one sample
    of pure nitrogen, <italic>M</italic>(N) = 14,006 721 4 g mol<sup>-1</sup> with
    a combined uncertainty <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0,000 001 8 g mol<sup>-1</sup>
    (an average of four partially independent values). Another sample, atmospheric
    nitrogen, similarly from four values, yielded <italic>M</italic>(N) = 14,006 727
    8 g mol<sup>-1</sup> with <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0,000 001 5 g mol<sup>-1</sup>
    corresponding to an isotope substance ratio <italic>n</italic>(<sup>14</sup>N)
    /<italic>n</italic>(<sup>15</sup>N) = <italic>f</italic>(<sup>14</sup>N)/<italic>f</italic>(<sup>15</sup>N)
    = 271,87 with <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0,11. The latter is in good agreement
    with the currently accepted IUPAC value of 272,0 with <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub>
    = 0,3. The measurements were carried out by means of the same rigid measurement
    procedures and instrumentation which are used in the isotopic measurements for
    ongoing redeterminations of the Avogadro constant. Although the measurements were
    not calibrated against synthetic N-isotope mixtures, the results compare favorably,
    within quoted uncertainties, with those selected by the International Union of
    Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as the hitherto "best measurements from a specific
    source" and those representative of terrestrial compositions. They suggest a new
    standard of reliability for molar-mass determinations. They also establish the
    best realization so far of traceability of nitrogen isotopic measurements to the
    mole in the Système International d'Unités (SI), as well as to the Avogadro constant.</p>
