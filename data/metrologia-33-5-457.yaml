  content: "<p>Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) data are typically
    recorded on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This produces an unevenly spaced time
    series on which it is difficult to perform an accurate two-sample variance analysis.
    We have investigated the effect of uneven data spacing on the computation of σ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(τ)
    [1-2]. Evenly spaced simulated data sets were generated for noise processes ranging
    from white phase modulation to random walk frequency modulation. σ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(τ)
    was then calculated for each noise type. Data were subsequently removed from each
    simulated data set to create two unevenly spaced sets with average intervals of
    2,8 and 3,6 days. These sparse sets correspond to typical TWSTFT data patterns.
    σ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(τ) was then calculated for each sparse data set
    using two different approaches. First, the missing data points were replaced by
    linear interpolation and σ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(τ) calculated from this
    now full data set. The second approach ignored the fact that the data were unevenly
    spaced and calculated σ<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(τ) as if the data were equally
    spaced with average spacing of 2,8 or 3,6 days. The impact of uneven data spacing
    on the results of these two approaches is significant and is discussed. Finally,
    techniques are presented for correcting errors caused by uneven data spacing in
    simulated TWSTFT data sets, and the appropriate technique is applied to a real
    data set.</p>"
