abstract:
- content: "<p>Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) data are typically
    recorded on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This produces an unevenly spaced time
    series on which it is difficult to perform an accurate two-sample variance analysis.
    We have investigated the effect of uneven data spacing on the computation of σ<sub>x</sub>(τ)
    [1-2]. Evenly spaced simulated data sets were generated for noise processes ranging
    from white phase modulation to random walk frequency modulation. σ<sub>x</sub>(τ)
    was then calculated for each noise type. Data were subsequently removed from each
    simulated data set to create two unevenly spaced sets with average intervals of
    2,8 and 3,6 days. These sparse sets correspond to typical TWSTFT data patterns.
    σ<sub>x</sub>(τ) was then calculated for each sparse data set using two different
    approaches. First, the missing data points were replaced by linear interpolation
    and σ<sub>x</sub>(τ) calculated from this now full data set. The second approach
    ignored the fact that the data were unevenly spaced and calculated σ<sub>x</sub>(τ)
    as if the data were equally spaced with average spacing of 2,8 or 3,6 days. The
    impact of uneven data spacing on the results of these two approaches is significant
    and is discussed. Finally, techniques are presented for correcting errors caused
    by uneven data spacing in simulated TWSTFT data sets, and the appropriate technique
    is applied to a real data set.</p>"
