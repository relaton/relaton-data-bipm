  content: "<p>A group of six iodine absorption cells has been tested in the cavity
    of an iodine-stabilized He-Ne laser for the investigation of the power-shift coefficient
    of the laser. It was found that the experimental method used for the power variation
    may significantly affect the laser frequency and the power-shift coefficient.
    The experimentally determined power-shift coefficient of the laser can be different
    for the different iodine absorption cells while other conditions are not changed.
    A weak correlation between the power-shift coefficient and the iodine-cell polarization
    extinction ratio is observed. Careful selection of iodine absorption cells and
    proper adjustment of the laser power are important to meet the specification of
    the power-shift coefficient given by the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures
    (CIPM) for a reproducible <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized He-Ne laser.</p>"
