abstract:
- content: "<p>An experiment has been made in the low-energy x-ray range at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures to estimate the change of the response of a
    commercial ionization chamber which, after calibration in a beam in terms of air
    kerma, is used in another beam. The results indicate a change in the chamber response
    of 0,2% to 0,5%, depending on the energy used.</p>"
