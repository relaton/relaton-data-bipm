  content: "<p>A EUROMET comparison of two long gauge blocks was organized by the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. Nine EUROMET laboratories had agreed to
    participate in this comparison. One of them withdrew its participation during
    the course of calibrations. The measurements started in autumn 1993 and ended
    in January 1995. The gauge blocks had nominal lengths of 600 mm and 1000 mm. The
    latter gauge block was damaged shortly before the end of the project and was replaced
    by one of 900 mm nominal length. The measurement items were the central length,
    the variation in length, and - if possible - the determination of the coefficient
    of thermal expansion. The measurements of the central length agree roughly within
    ± 0,05 μm and the estimated values of the uncertainty overlap. The measured values
    of the variation in length fluctuate by a few hundred nanometres. The agreement
    of the coefficient of thermal expansion is satisfactory.</p>"
