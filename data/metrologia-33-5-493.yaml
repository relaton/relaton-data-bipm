  content: "<p>In order to compare the humidity standards at the Centre Technique
    des Industries Aerauliques et Thermiques (France) and the Centre for Metrology
    and Accreditation (Finland), a dew-point hygrometer was calibrated at both laboratories
    within a EUROMET project. There were eight measurement points in the range -40
    °C to 60 °C. The difference between the standards was determined and its uncertainty
    was evaluated. The difference was between -0,03 °C and +0,09 °C with the average
    being 0,01 °C. The uncertainty of the difference was ±0,08 °C to ±0,17 °C (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2). The measurements and the analysis of the results are reported in this paper.</p>"
