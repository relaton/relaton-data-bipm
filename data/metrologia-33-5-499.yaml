abstract:
- content: "<p>A series of detailed high-precision measurements has been carried out
    on Sony metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), of a type
    which have previously been reported to produce anomalous results. We observed
    anomalous values for the i = 4 quantized Hall step, but only when our measurement
    procedures did not comply fully with the published guidelines of the Comité Consultatif
    d'Électricité.</p>"
