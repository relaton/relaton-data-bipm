  content: "<p>A series of detailed high-precision measurements has been carried out
    on Sony metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), of a type
    which have previously been reported to produce anomalous results. We observed
    anomalous values for the <italic>i</italic> = 4 quantized Hall step, but only
    when our measurement procedures did not comply fully with the published guidelines
    of the Comité Consultatif d'Électricité.</p>"
