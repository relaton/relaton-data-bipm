abstract:
- content: "<p>Platinum-iridium mass artefacts are known to pick up carbonaceous contamination
    from the atmosphere. We examine the likely physical mechanism of carbonaceous
    ''build-up'', and analyse historical weighing data using this model, to deduce
    the rate of increase as a function of time.</p><p>Cleaning of Pt-10%Ir reference
    kilograms is currently conducted at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM) by a manual chamois-leather rubbing followed by washing in recondensed
    water droplets from a jet of steam (nettoyage/lavage). We investigate an alternative
    approach involving exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and ozone in air at room
    temperature and pressure. This process (i) is shown to be more effective than
    the cleaning/washing procedure for removing hydrocarbon contamination, (ii) involves
    no physical contact with the reference mass, (iii) is an easily repeatable and
    reproducible method, since UV light intensity and ozone gas concentration can
    be measured reliably. Both UV light and ozone in the required amounts can be produced
    conveniently in situ by short-wave UV lamps which are widely available.</p><p>Optimum
    UV intensities, ozone concentration and cleaning times are given, and recommendations
    for experiments to validate the procedure on reference kilograms are discussed.
    If implemented, the cleaning method described should improve the long-term accuracy
    with which the SI kilogram can be realized by national standards laboratories
    from ~1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> to ~3 parts in 10<sup>9</sup>, much the same as
    would be achieved if a BIPM nettoyage/lavage could be applied regularly by national
    laboratories. This will, of course, need to be confirmed by conducting weighing
    trials on real Pt-Ir kilograms.</p>"
