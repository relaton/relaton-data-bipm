  content: "<p>A polarimetric, nonlinearity-free, homodyne interferometer for vibration
    measurement is described. Two outputs are provided from this interferometer for
    determining the value and sign of vibration, the phase of which can be independently
    controlled by a retarder and a polarizing beam splitter. The nonlinearity is corrected.
    This system allows a complete determination of both amplitude and phase of a vibrating
    object. Vibration amplitudes from 6 nm to 7218 nm with standard deviation ranging
    from 0,9% to 0,02% are demonstrated. The ability of nano-step tracking (about
    1,1 nm per step) is also shown in this paper. The dynamic range from dc to 7 kHz
    is verified.</p>"
