  content: "<p>An international comparison of roundness measurements at the highest
    level of accuracy has been carried out between eight European laboratories. Three
    roundness standards with different designs and roundness deviations were measured.
    One standard was a commercially available type, two standards were developed for
    the purpose of this comparison. The agreement between the laboratories was within
    Â±20 nm for the standard with the smallest roundness deviation. The comparison
    was sponsored by the Commission of the European Communities.</p>"
