  content: "<p>Modern absolute gravity meters utilize laser interferometers to measure
    the acceleration of a retroreflector that is falling freely in a vacuum chamber.
    This paper describes a novel approach to processing the resulting data by employing
    algorithms developed for processing perturbed spacecraft orbits. These algorithms
    allow unprecedented accuracy, flexibility, and ease of treatment of a variety
    of troublesome error sources including such things as drag effects and local gravitational
    or electromagnetic fields.</p>"
