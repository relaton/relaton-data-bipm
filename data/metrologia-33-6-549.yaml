abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryogenic radiometers are recognized as by far the most accurate radiometers
    for visible and nearinfrared radiation. The now widespread use of such instruments
    around the world as the basis for optical radiation measurement scales makes it
    important to carry out a comparison. This will ensure not only that the instruments
    perform to the uncertainties claimed, a few parts in 10<sup>4</sup> or less, but
    also that their operators can disseminate such uncertainties. In this paper results
    of some pilot comparisons, both direct and indirect using transfer standards,
    are given. The experimental techniques used at the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM) to achieve the highest accuracy are described in detail.</p>"
