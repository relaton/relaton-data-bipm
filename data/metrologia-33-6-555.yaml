  content: "<p>A long gauge in the form of a thick-walled tube is converted to a Fabry-PÃ©rot
    cavity by attaching partial reflectors to its ends. The length of this gauge is
    determined from a number of absolute frequency measurements of the cavity resonances.
    A set of tunable, well-known CO<sub>2</sub> laser frequencies is used for lengths
    between 1 m and 10 m.</p>"
