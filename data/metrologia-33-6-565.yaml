  content: <p>The results of an international comparison between the He-Ne lasers
    stabilized to <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at 633 nm of the IMGC (Istituto di Metrologia
    "G. Colonnetti", Turin, Italy) and the IFA-IFTAR (Institute of Atomic Physics-IFTAR,
    Department of Lasers, Bucharest, Romania) are reported. The mean frequency difference,
    considering the hyperfine structure components d, e, f and g of the R(127) 11-5
    transition, was Δν = ν<sub>RO.2</sub> - ν<sub>IMGCA4/5</sub> = 3,8 kHz, standard
    uncertainty <italic>u</italic> = 5,7 kHz, or Δν/ν<sub>0</sub> = 0,8 × 10<sup>-11</sup>,
    standard uncertainty <italic>u</italic> = 1,2 × 10<sup>-11</sup>. The frequency
    stability, expressed as the relative Allan standard deviation of the beat note
    between the two lasers, resulted 3,7 × 10<sup>-12</sup> for a 100 s sampling time.</p>
