  content: "<p>Nicholas has proposed an alternative model to the ITS-90 to represent
    the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity of platinum. While the results
    are interesting and there is certainly merit in developing models which better
    represent the underlying physics, we believe Nicholas has overextended the utility
    of the model by suggesting that his calculations indicate that the ITS-90 deviates
    significantly from thermodynamic temperature over the range 70 K to 270 K. We
    show that the discrepancy between his model and the ITS-90 in this range may stem
    from the failure of his model to account for the details of the phonon spectrum
    of platinum. Further, the physical interpretation which Nicholas assigns to his
    model requires exotic mechanisms which are not supported by theory. While a re-evaluation
    of the thermodynamic data may indeed be warranted, the Nicholas model is not an
    adequate physical framework on which to base such an evaluation.</p>"
