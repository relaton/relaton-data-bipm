  content: "<p>International traceability to the SI is increasingly demanded for measurements
    in chemistry. These concern measurements made not only for industrial chemical
    manufacturing but also for checking the safety of a wide range of food and agricultural
    products, for environmental protection, for medicine, as well as for a multitude
    of regulatory purposes. This article outlines the role that the Comité Consultatif
    pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) can play in establishing traceability at the
    highest level for such measurements. A brief account is given of the actions taken
    so far by the Committee. These include the precise description of primary methods,
    the meaning of traceability for measurements in chemistry and the organization
    of some key international comparisons designed to test the procedures drawn up
    to guide them. Plans for future work are described.</p>"
