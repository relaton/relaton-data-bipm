- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Some aspects of the use and misuse of scientific language are discussed,
    particularly in relation to quantity calculus, the names and symbols for quantities
    and units, and the choice of units - including the possible use of non-SI units.
    The discussion is intended to be constructive, and to suggest ways in which common
    usage can be improved.</p>"
