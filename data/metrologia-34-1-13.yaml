abstract:
- content: "<p>Apart from the measurement standards available in general metrology
    in the form of the realizations of units of measurement, measurement standards
    for chemical composition are needed in the vast field of measurements of chemical
    composition, because the main aim of such measurements is to quantify non-isolated
    substances, often in complicated matrices, to which the ''classical'' measurement
    standards and their lower-level derivatives are not directly applicable. At present,
    most chemical measurement standards are material artefacts. But not all of these
    artefacts are measurement standards according to the metrological definition,
    i.e. firmly linked to the SI unit in which the chemical composition represented
    by the standard is expressed. In fact, only a very restricted number of really
    reliable chemical measurement standards is available at present. Since it is very
    difficult and time-consuming to substantially increase this number and, on the
    other hand, reliable reference points are increasingly needed for all kinds of
    chemical measurement, primary methods of measurement and high-level reference
    measurements as well as primary measurement devices and procedures will play an
    increasingly important role for ensuring world-wide comparability and hence mutual
    acceptance of chemical measurement results.</p>"
