abstract:
- content: "<p>Among the analytical methods used to determine chemical composition,
    there are two special methods based on reaction chemistry. These are gravimetry
    and titrimetry, and taken together they are called classical analysis. They are
    special because they lead directly to independent values of chemical quantities
    expressed in SI units. Gravimetry and titrimetry can be performed in such a way
    that their operation is completely understood, and all significant sources of
    error in the measurement process can be evaluated and expressed in SI units together
    with a complete uncertainty budget. Such chemical measurements are metrologically
    valid and stand alone. They have no need to be compared with a reference material
    of the quantity being measured and therefore are called definitive or primary
    methods. In this paper the basic equations and terms of gravimetry and titrimetry
    are discussed, together with detailed examples of each. This is followed by a
    discussion of the errors associated with gravimetry and titrimetry, and instrumental
    techniques that can be used for evaluating these errors. There is also a discussion
    of the uncertainties associated with both systematic and random errors in gravimetry
    and titrimetry. The paper is underpinned by historical sketches of several important
    issues and scientists connected with the development of classical analysis. A
    case is made for a revival of the use of classical analysis in chemical metrology,
    together with some suggestions as to how such a revival might be implemented.</p>"
