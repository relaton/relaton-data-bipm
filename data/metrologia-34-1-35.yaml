  content: "<p>Reference materials have been widely used as measurement standards
    in the fields of chemistry, biology, engineering and physics, and have played
    an important role in ensuring the comparability of measurement results. In recent
    years, an increasing number of countries and international organizations have
    made efforts to develop reference materials and have discussed such basic underlying
    issues as terminology, hierarchy, traceability and uncertainty. This paper presents
    a personal view on some of these matters and proposes the development of a hierarchy
    of reference materials certified for chemical composition.</p>"
