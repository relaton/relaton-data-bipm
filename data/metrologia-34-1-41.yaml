  content: "<p>Metrology in general, and issues such as traceability and measurement
    uncertainty in particular, are new to most analytical chemists, many of whom are
    unconvinced of their value. There is a danger of a widening of the cultural gap
    between metrologists and analytical chemists and it is important to encourage
    greater collaboration and cross-fertilization. This paper discusses some of the
    similarities and differences in the approaches adopted by metrologists and analytical
    chemists and indicates how these approaches could be combined to establish a unique
    metrology of chemical measurement acceptable to both cultures.</p>"
