  content: "<p>Progress in science is often achieved by modifications of hypotheses
    imposed by reliable results of measurements with small uncertainty. The application
    of the discipline of metrology to chemistry, based on the SI and the estimation
    of uncertainties, is illustrated by suggested refinements of the presentation
    of molar-mass values of the elements as recommended, and biennially revised, by
    the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). All these values
    from 1969 to 1995 are tabulated here with attributed uncertainties, and the changes
    achieved in all these uncertainties are presented pictorially. Molar mass is the
    factor that converts, with its entity-specific uncertainty, the mass of that specified
    entity in a given sample from a value expressed as a mass quantity to one in the
    amount-of-substance SI base quantity. An element with two or more isotopes may
    exhibit differences in isotope abundances. A small range of molar-mass values
    may exist even in normal terrestrial materials. The IUPAC combines, with only
    one-digit precision, such ranges with experimental uncertainties. Nevertheless,
    the IUPAC values in the past have proved highly reliable for use in chemistry.
    For anticipated improvements in the accuracy of some chemical measurements, two-digit
    uncertainties, evaluated and published separately from normal terrestrial ranges
    of molar mass, are proposed.</p>"
