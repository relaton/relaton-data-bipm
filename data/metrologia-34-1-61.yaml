abstract:
- content: "<p>The definition and concept of primary method are explained, taking
    examples from the fields of thermometry and measurements of amount of substance.
    It is shown that although few methods can be considered strictly primary, small
    departures from the strict definition can be quantified and useful practical primary
    methods are thus available. The links between primary methods of measurement,
    primary standards of measurement and primary reference materials are discussed.</p>"
