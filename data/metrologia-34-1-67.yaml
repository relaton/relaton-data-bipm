abstract:
- content: "<p>Basic principles for traceability of measurements to the Système International
    d'Unités (SI) in general, and for measurements of amount of substance in particular,
    are described. Analogies with long-standing traceability schemes in physical measurements
    are given and an attempt is made to show the probable development of traceability
    for amount-of-substance measurements, a process now in its early stages.</p>"
