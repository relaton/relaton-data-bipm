abstract:
- content: "<p>Entitic quantities are quantities, such as entitic number (or number
    of entities) N<sub>e</sub>(B),, entitic mass m<sub>e</sub>(B) or entitic volume
    V<sub>e</sub>(B), relating to a specified ''generalized molecule'' or entity B,
    such as H (meaning a single atom of hydrogen) or H<sub>2</sub>O or {(1 - x)H<sub>2</sub>0
    + xCH<sub>3</sub>OH}. Molar quantities are the quotients of an extensive quantity
    and amount of substance n<sub>B</sub>, such as molar number N<sub>m</sub> {or
    Avogadro constant L = N<sub>e</sub>(B)/n(B)}, molar mass m<sub>m</sub>(B) {or
    M(B)}, or molar volume V<sub>m</sub>(B), also of an entity B. It is shown that
    there is no imperative need to retain quantities like amount of substance n, or
    the Avogadro constant L, or the molar gas constant R, or the SI unit: mole. All
    of these could be discarded from the equations of physical science, though whether
    it would be useful to discard them is of course open to question.</p>"
