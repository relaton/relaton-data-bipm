abstract:
- content: "<p>Effects of non-normal incidence and finite angular beam width on silicon
    photodiode responsivity comparisons are modelled and compared with measurements.
    These effects may be significant if the photodiodes being compared have different
    oxide layer thicknesses, particularly at short wavelengths. They may also be significant
    in the transfer of high-accuracy cryogenic radiometer measurements to monochromator-based
    measurements.</p>"
