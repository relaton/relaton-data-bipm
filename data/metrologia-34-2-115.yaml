abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper describes the main steps in the realization of the Système
    International d'Unités (SI) base unit of luminous intensity, the candela, at the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The realization, using incandescent
    lamps, is based on radiant power measured with absolute radiometers. Transfer
    to other lamps is done by V(λ)-corrected detectors. The lamps are grouped according
    to their distribution temperature. These groups of lamps and a group of V(λ)-corrected
    detectors are combined to form a network for the maintenance and dissemination
    of the unit with a reduced uncertainty. The network presented in detail here ensures
    excellent continuity of the maintained unit.</p>"
