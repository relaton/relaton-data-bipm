  content: "<p>The paper describes the main steps in the realization of the Système
    International d'Unités (SI) base unit of luminous intensity, the candela, at the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The realization, using incandescent
    lamps, is based on radiant power measured with absolute radiometers. Transfer
    to other lamps is done by <italic>V</italic>(λ)-corrected detectors. The lamps
    are grouped according to their distribution temperature. These groups of lamps
    and a group of <italic>V</italic>(λ)-corrected detectors are combined to form
    a network for the maintenance and dissemination of the unit with a reduced uncertainty.
    The network presented in detail here ensures excellent continuity of the maintained
    unit.</p>"
