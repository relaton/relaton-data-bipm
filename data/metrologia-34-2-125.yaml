abstract:
- content: "<p>The effect of the diffraction of spherical light waves and Gaussian
    beams in a Saunders-type interferometer was analysed numerically to supplement
    our previous report on the measurement of the absolute density of water.</p><p>In
    that work, buoyancy measurements were taken for fused-quartz spheres submerged
    in water. In determining the volume of these spheres, a Saunders-type interferometer
    was used to measure the diameter. However, it was suspected that distortion of
    wave fronts due to diffraction may have occurred in the interferometer, which
    could introduce a bias in the sphere volume, and hence in the measured water density.</p><p>The
    numerical analysis here shows that although there was significant distortion of
    the interference pattern near the optical axis, it did not impair diameter measurements,
    as long as the method of data analysis originally described by Saunders was used.
    Therefore, our measured values for the absolute density of water remain valid.</p>"
