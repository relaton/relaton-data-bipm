abstract:
- content: "<p>A gravimetric study of the effect of cleaning XSH Alacrite standards
    with ethanol and isopropanol showed considerable short-term mass instability after
    this process, due primarily to the sorption of atmospheric gases and cleaning
    solvents. A new cleaning method was thus required. The first method investigated
    is that used currently by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)
    for cleaning/washing iridium-platinum standards. Initial results of a gravimetric
    study and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis show that this method
    has a greater cleaning power than that using alcohols and that there is no short-term
    instability. It was nevertheless found that during the first year following this
    type of cleaning, the relative mass of the standard increased by about 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup>
    and the reproducibility of the cleaning/washing procedure could not be ensured
    to better than 4 × 10<sup>-9</sup>.</p>"
