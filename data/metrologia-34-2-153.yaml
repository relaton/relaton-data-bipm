abstract:
- content: "<p>The reference for (relative) measurements of the viscosity of liquids
    is the viscosity of bi-distilled water at 20 Â°C. Applying the so-called step-up
    method to calibrate a series of capillary viscometers can result in deviations
    of roughly 0,2 % in the first liquid, normally an oil, that is used after the
    distilled water. This error is mainly caused by the difference in surface tension
    between water and oil. This report shows that with a special Ostwald-type viscometer,
    this deviation can be reduced significantly.</p>"
