abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements of depth-setting standards, carried out at nine national
    metrology laboratories within the framework of EUROMET project No. 301, are compared.
    The objects used for this comparison take the form of chromium-coated silicon
    substrates with rectangular grooves of 0,1 mm and 0,01 mm width and nominal depths
    from 30 nm to 3200 nm. For the calibration several stylus instruments, and interference
    microscopes based on different measuring principles, were used. The comparison
    shows that the participating laboratories are able, in general, to determine the
    groove depth with uncertainties ranging from a few nanometres for a groove of
    30 nm nominal depth to some tens of nanometres for a groove of 3200 nm. At 3200
    nm the scatter of measurements between the participants is characterized by a
    standard deviation of 40 nm, a value considered unsatisfactory for calibrations
    at a primary level.</p>"
