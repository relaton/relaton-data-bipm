  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Comparisons of the air kerma standards of six national laboratories,
    carried out in <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma radiation, show an overall agreement of
    0,8 % between the standards. This result is not quite as good as that of comparisons
    in <sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation, mainly because the evaluation of the ionization-chamber
    wall correction is less accurate for <sup>137</sup>Cs radiation. However, this
    agreement is acceptable for radio-protection applications.</p>"
