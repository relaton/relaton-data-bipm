abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparisons of the air kerma standards of six national laboratories,
    carried out in<sup>137</sup>Cs gamma radiation, show an overall agreement of 0,8
    % between the standards. This result is not quite as good as that of comparisons
    in<sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation, mainly because the evaluation of the ionization-chamber
    wall correction is less accurate for<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation. However, this
    agreement is acceptable for radio-protection applications.</p>"
