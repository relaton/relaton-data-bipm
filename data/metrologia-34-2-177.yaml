abstract:
- content: "<p>A simple, economical and time-saving procedure is described for maintaining
    water triple point cells (WTPCs) ready for use for indefinite periods, based on
    storing the WTPCs totally frozen. The uncertainty of reproducibility of the triple
    point temperature does not exceed 0,1 mK.</p><p>The WTPC is kept in direct contact
    with crushed ice in a Dewar flask. Under such conditions the natural tendency
    of the cell is to solidify completely over a period of several weeks, but it will
    not break as long as the crushed ice is made of deionized water. The procedure
    for inducing the initial appearance of the ice phase seems irrelevant within the
    stated uncertainty. This may indicate that the impurities in the cell attain a
    stationary quasi-two-dimensional distribution in the ice phase, having migrated
    to the interfaces between the individual crystals, some of which can be observed
    with the naked eye (linear dimensions 1 cm to 3 cm). This final state is only
    slightly perturbed during use, since a very small fraction of ice is melted when
    forming the inner and outer ice/water interfaces. The triple point temperature
    is mainly determined by the bulk properties of the pure crystals. Reduced lixiviation
    and unattended shipping of the WTPCs are possible by-products of the method.</p>"
