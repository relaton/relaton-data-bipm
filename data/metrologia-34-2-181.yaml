abstract:
- content: "<p>The hyperfine constants ΔeQq, ΔC, Δd and Δδ are necessary for the reproduction
    or simulation of a hyperfine spectrum in iodine. A new empirical formula predicting
    ΔeQq to calculate any hyperfine component frequency of a ro-vibrational transition
    in the B-X system of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>, covering v' = 6 to v' = 43, is
    presented here. The accuracy of the prediction of ΔC, Δd and Δδ are discussed.
    The predicted value of ΔeQq agrees well with the recently presented value calculated
    for an observed hyperfine spectrum at 637 nm.</p>"
