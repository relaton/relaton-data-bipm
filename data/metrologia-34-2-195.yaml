  content: "<p>NORAMET is a regional cooperation in metrology, involving the national
    measurement laboratories of Canada, Mexico and the United States of America. Most
    of its current activities are focused on establishing and documenting the degree
    of equivalence of the calibration services offered by members. This will be done
    by comparisons of key standards and techniques and by exchanges of visits to establish
    mutual confidence. The purpose is to facilitate international trade by providing
    assurance that each country's measurement system is traceable to the SI units
    with stated uncertainties.</p>"
