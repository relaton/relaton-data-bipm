abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is proposed for measurement of the acceleration of gravity
    based on the fact that, for a fixed vertical position, the frequency of small
    mechanical vertical oscillations of a superconducting levitated body placed in
    a nonuniform magnetic field is independent of the levitated mass. Particular features
    of the method and measurements at an uncertainty level of a few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>
    are discussed.</p>"
