abstract:
- content: "<p>An on-site comparison of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) resistance standards
    of the PhysikalischTechnische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made in October 1995. Measurements of a 100 Ω
    standard in terms of R<sub>H</sub>(2), the quantized resistance corresponding
    to the quantum number 2, agreed to -5,5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with a relative
    combined standard uncertainty u<sub>c</sub> = 19 × 10<sup>-10</sup>. Measurements
    of 10 000 Ω/100 Ω and 100 Ω/1 Ω ratios agreed to -4 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with
    u<sub>c</sub> = 19 × 10<sup>-10</sup> and 12 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with u<sub>c</sub>
    = 26 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, respectively.</p>"
