  content: "<p>Many interpolation equations used in the calibration of radiation thermometers
    are semi-empirical in nature, providing little information on the characteristics
    of the thermometer. In this paper a systematic approach is taken in the derivation
    of two general interpolation equations, the first based on Wien's law and the
    second on Planck's law. Because these equations are based on physical principles
    they can be used with increased accuracy and confidence over semi-empirical equations,
    and their limitations are easily understood. The two general equations provide
    a framework for the development of specific equations for radiation thermometers
    and for the understanding of the relationships of interpolation equations to the
    effective wavelength formulation currently employed in radiation thermometry.</p>"
