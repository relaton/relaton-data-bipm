abstract:
- content: "<p>We report results of an investigation of the temporal variation of
    the temperature of triple point of water (TPW) cells, in which the ice mantles
    were prepared by four different techniques using: (i) solid CO<sub>2</sub>, (ii)
    an immersion cooler, (iii) liquid-nitrogen-cooled rods, and (iv) liquid nitrogen
    (LN), first passing cold nitrogen vapours and then LN directly into the wells
    of the cells. The temperature of the TPW cell water was either approximately 274
    K or 295 K when the freezing of the ice mantle was started. No visible cracks
    formed during the preparation of any of the mantles using the crushed solid-CO<sub>2</sub>
    or the immersion cooler method, but all of the ice mantles cracked when prepared
    using the LN-cooled-rod and LN techniques. The cracked mantles, however, soon
    healed. Initially, the temperatures of the mantles prepared by the four methods
    varied, but after about three or four days they agreed to within 0,1 mK; after
    one week they agreed to within 0,03 mK, except for mantles prepared by the LN
    technique, for which nine days were once required for one of the mantles; after
    eleven days, the results were practically the same. It appears that the temperature
    variations observed during the first few days following the preparation of mantles
    could be caused by a combination of (i) temperature decrease due to introduction
    of strains in the ice and to formation of fine ice crystals during the preparation
    of the mantle and (ii) temperature increase due to the relief of strains and the
    gradual conversion of fine ice crystals to larger ice crystals. Mantles that underwent
    severe cracking thereby released most of the energy associated with the large
    strains introduced during preparation of the mantle.</p>"
