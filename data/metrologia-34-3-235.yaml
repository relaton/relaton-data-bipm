abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the framework of EUROMET Project No. 308, a set of five metallic
    wires of diameters between 0,05 mm and 1 mm was circulated and calibrated by the
    national metrology institutes of the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany and
    France. Diametral measurements were made in the middle of each wire in four different
    directions approximately 45Â° apart with the aim of assessing variations in diameter.
    No special measurement procedure was prescribed: each participating laboratory
    had to follow its own measurement procedure. The comparison reflects the state-of-the-art
    for small external diameter measurement in the Western European national metrology
    institutes.</p>"
