  content: "<p>A determination of the quantized Hall resistance in terms of the SI
    ohm as realized at the National Measurement Laboratory (Australia) was reported
    in 1988. The 1988 result was <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub> = [1 + 9,2(6,6) ×
    10<sup>-8</sup>] <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub>. A new determination has been
    completed, with reassessments of the various corrections and uncertainties. The
    new, 1995, result is <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub> = [1 + 0,4(4,4)  × 10<sup>-8</sup>]
    <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub>.</p>"
