abstract:
- content: "<p>A determination of the quantized Hall resistance in terms of the SI
    ohm as realized at the National Measurement Laboratory (Australia) was reported
    in 1988. The 1988 result was R<sub>K</sub> = [1 + 9,2(6,6) × 10<sup>-8</sup>]
    R<sub>K-90</sub>. A new determination has been completed, with reassessments of
    the various corrections and uncertainties. The new, 1995, result is R<sub>K</sub>
    = [1 + 0,4(4,4) × 10<sup>-8</sup>] R<sub>K-90</sub>.</p>"
