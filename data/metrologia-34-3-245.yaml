abstract:
- content: "<p>We report on the design and preliminary performance of a novel torsion
    balance for the measurement of the Newtonian gravitational constant. The design
    takes advantage of the properties of a wide, heavily loaded torsion strip to enhance
    the ratio of gravitational signal-to-noise torques beyond that achievable by the
    traditional Cavendish torsion balance. The results of preliminary experiments
    suggest that an accuracy of 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup> should be possible.</p>"
