abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of a mechanical comparison of short gauge blocks between
    twelve laboratories of seven Ibero-American countries plus Spain and Germany are
    presented. Three sets of five gauges, grade K, calibrated interferometrically
    by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) were circulated following three
    different loops, with a maximum of four laboratories per group. The Centro Espanol
    de Metrologia (CEM), acting as the coordinator and pilot laboratory, calibrated
    the three sets of gauges before and after circulation. The central length and
    the variation in length were measured. The results show good agreement, with some
    discrepancies which are analysed in this paper, and they give the participants
    the opportunity to check their technical competence. This comparison is a first
    step towards the mutual recognition of calibration results and certificates among
    the countries concerned.</p>"
