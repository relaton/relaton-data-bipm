  content: "<p>For the first time, the cryogenic radiometer of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has been taken to a national metrology institute for
    direct comparison with another cryogenic radiometer. This paper describes a comparison
    at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany) with
    the PTB cryogenic radiometer. The two systems have been shown to differ, in relative
    terms, by 2,3 × 10<sup>-4</sup> in the measurement of optical power at λ = 632,8
    nm with a power level of about 700 μW. The standard uncertainty in the determination
    of this relative difference is estimated to be 5,7 × 10<sup>-5</sup>. As the source
    of this discrepancy, which is larger than the uncertainties, has not yet been
    found, a closer investigation of the two systems is necessary.</p>"
