  content: "<p>After the adoption of the new mise en pratique of the definition of
    the metre in 1992, a wide-ranging programme of laser comparisons at lambda 633
    nm, the most used of the recommended wavelengths, was carried out involving national
    laboratories and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). During
    the period July 1993 to September 1995, six grouped and five bilateral comparisons
    were made involving thirty-five national laboratories. This report will comprise
    six different parts. The first part, this paper, describes the general conditions
    for such comparisons and the results of the unpublished bilateral comparisons,
    and in the five following parts, the detailed results of the grouped comparisons
    will be presented and discussed. Except for a few lasers which exhibited some
    malfunction, the frequency differences between the lasers being compared lay inside
    the standard uncertainty (2,5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) given in the mise en pratique,
    once the lasers had been adjusted to have the recommended parameter values.</p>"
