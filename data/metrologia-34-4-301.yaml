  content: "<p>This second Northern European comparison between seven lasers exhibits
    closer results than the first comparison. A standard uncertainty of 5 kHz was
    obtained against 15 kHz in 1990, while the frequency average of the group of lasers
    was about the same with 3,9 kHz, using the BIPM4 laser as reference. A large frequency
    difference on a laser observed during the first comparison was again observed;
    partial explanations of the origin of this difference were found. This difference
    has been excluded from the calculation of the average. Typical frequency stabilities
    using Allan standard deviations of about 1,6 × 10<sup>-11</sup> and 1,7 × 10<sup>-12</sup>
    were observed on 1s and 100 s sampling times, respectively.</p>"
