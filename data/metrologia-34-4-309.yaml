  content: "<p>A laser control system is described which locks the frequencies of
    three He-Ne lasers (543 nm, 612 nm and 633 nm) to iodine transitions using a single
    external cell stabilizer. The system is fully automated and is now used at the
    CSIRO to provide three unmodulated frequency references for the CSIRO gauge block
    interferometers and for a 1 m length bar interferometer. The relative uncertainty
    of the three references is thought to be better than 2 Ã— 10<sup>-10</sup>.</p>"
