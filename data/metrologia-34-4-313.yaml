  content: "<p>We have stabilized a CO<sub>2</sub> laser on narrow saturated absorption
    resonances of CO<sub>2</sub> detected on the transmitted beam of an external Fabry-Perot
    cavity in the 30 THz spectral region. By using another CO<sub>2</sub> laser stabilized
    on a close OsO<sub>4</sub> line whose absolute frequency is precisely known, and
    measuring the beat frequency 4 with a precision of 100 Hz, we determined the absolute
    frequency of twenty CO<sub>2</sub> laser lines, with uncertainties between 100
    Hz and 1 kHz mainly limited by the accuracy of the OsO<sub>4</sub> grid. The set
    of measurements reveal some discrepancies with data based on measurements performed
    with the widely used saturated fluorescence technique; we attribute these to pressure
    shifts of several kilohertz under the conditions of this last method.</p>"
