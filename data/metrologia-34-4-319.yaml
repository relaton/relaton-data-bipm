abstract:
- content: "<p>The spectrum of the titanium monoxide molecule has been studied by
    means of a sub-Doppler experiment combining an effusive beam of TiO and a cw tunable
    dye laser beam. In the 560 nm to 565 nm range, 260 absorption lines have been
    recorded through the laser-induced fluorescence technique of detection. Because
    the absorption profiles are narrow, a sensitive program of data acquisition and
    analysis is used. These wave-numbers have been measured by reference to the absorption
    spectrum of the iodine molecule to an absolute uncertainty of 30 MHz (0,001 cm<sup>-1</sup>).
    For the 140 lines of the c1-a1 (0-0) band of<sup>48</sup>Ti<sup>16</sup>O which
    have been identified, the rms error between measured and calculated wave-numbers
    is just 21 MHz (0,0007 cm<sup>-1</sup>).</p>"
