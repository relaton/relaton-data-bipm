abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently developed microform measurement techniques have reduced the
    measurement uncertainties in the geometry of Rockwell diamond indenters. It is
    now possible to establish standard-grade Rockwell diamond indenters characterized
    by high geometric uniformity, high hardness performance uniformity, interchangeability
    and reproducibility. By using the standard indenters under different national
    standard machines and a standardized testing cycle, a world-wide unified Rockwell
    hardness scale could be established with metrological traceability, stability
    and reproducibility. Geometric measurements and hardness tests in five laboratories
    have shown that tightly controlled indenter geometry can significantly improve
    the consistency of Rockwell C hardness (HRC) measurements. These results support
    the feasibility of establishing a world-wide unified HRC scale with an expanded
    uncertainty of approximately 0,2 HRC and without significant bias with respect
    to an ideal scale.</p>"
