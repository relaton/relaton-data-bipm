abstract:
- content: "<p>A ring laser goniometer was investigated in different applications
    of precision angle measurement, such as the calibration of optical polygons and
    optical encoders, external angle measurement of rotating objects and inertial
    angle measurement by rotation of the goniometer itself. The results agree with
    standard methods of angle measurement to about 0,5 Âµrad (0,1 ). Further improvement
    in accuracy is expected mainly from the reduction of noise in the mechanical and
    electrical setup of the measurement system.</p>"
