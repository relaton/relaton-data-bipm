  content: "<p>The results are reported from the calibration, using Thompson's method,
    of a 10 : 1 ratio transformer which will be used for setting up scales of capacitance
    at the Electrotechnical Laboratory, Tsukuba. The deviation of the ratio from the
    nominal value of 10 : 1 was measured as -1.37 × 10<sup>-7</sup> for the in-phase
    component and -7,22 × 10<sup>-7</sup> for the quadrature component, with the transformer
    operated at a frequency of 1592 Hz with an rms applied voltage of 100 V. The uncertainties
    of the measurement were estimated to be 5 × 10<sup>-9</sup> for the in-phase component
    and 1,2 × 10<sup>-8</sup> for the quadrature component.</p>"
