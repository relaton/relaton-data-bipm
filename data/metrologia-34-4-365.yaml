  content: "<p>The decade series 10-5-2-2-1 and 10-5-3-2-1 have been studied at the
    Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) to find designs which
    give minimum variances for up to forty-eight weighings. For the calibration designs
    used for both submultiples and multiples of the unit of mass, it was found that
    the variances decrease smoothly without maxima or minima as the number of weighings
    increases. Improved designs also produced smaller variances than those currently
    used to calibrate multiples of the unit of mass.</p>"
