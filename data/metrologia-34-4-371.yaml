abstract:
- content: "<p>A water triple point (WTP) cell maintained for the past three years
    at the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial (INTI, Argentina) in a totally
    frozen state, was compared on three consecutive Mondays with a WTP cell from the
    Instituto Centroamericano de Investigación y Tecnología Industrial (ICAITI, Guatemala).
    The latter was prepared by letting it freeze slowly and completely over a period
    of one month in an ice bath at 0 °C, under the influence of the 0,01 °C temperature
    difference. Preparation an measuring techniques are described. Since measurements
    were performed using four polarizing currents (5 mA, □2 × 5 mA, 10 mA, and □2
    × 10 mA), results are compared using two, three, and four currents, in order to
    extrapolate to zero power.</p><p>The main results were the following. By comparing
    the temperatures measured on the same day, the WTP temperatures realized using
    the two cells differed by less than ±24 µK (±5 µK when using only three currents
    for extrapolation). These differences do not depend on the long-term stability
    of the measuring system. By comparing the temperatures measured over the two-week
    period, the maximum temperature difference measured within a single cell was 129
    µK (82 µK when using only three currents for extrapolation). These differences
    reflect the long-term instability of the measuring system, but should have a limited
    effect on precision thermometry.</p>"
