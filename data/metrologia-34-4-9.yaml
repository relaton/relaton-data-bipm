abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the absolute diffuse reflectance factor scales of the
    National Research Council (NRC, Canada) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB, Germany) for radiance factor measurements in the d/0 geometry was carried
    out in 1996. The spectral range of the comparison was 360 nm to 830 nm. The transfer
    standards exchanged were two matte opal glasses, one of which was similar to those
    used in a 1981 international comparison between the NRC, the NBS, and the PTB.
    The current NRC/PTB agreement is within 0,15 % from 370 nm to 830 nm, which is
    well within the combined relative standard uncertainties for the two laboratories.
    These results are generally in good agreement with those of the 1981 exchange
    but are significantly improved for wavelengths below 420 nm, where discrepancies
    of up to 0,5 % were previously reported at 390 nm. The improvement at shorter
    wavelengths is largely due to improvements in the uniformity of the radiance of
    the sphere wall and out-of-band blocking of the interference filters used for
    wavelength separation.</p>"
