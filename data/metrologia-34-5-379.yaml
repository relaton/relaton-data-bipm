  content: <p>In this paper we describe the application of linear predictors to the
    metrology of clocks, to time-scale generation and to the characterization of clocks
    in terms of their predictability. The ideas are general and can be applied to
    other fields of metrology in which very precise measurement techniques are used
    to reveal an unstable and time-dependent measurand. In such measurements, it is
    important to make the best possible prediction of the next measurements. If the
    prediction uncertainty is small then the measurand is meaningful and useful. Prediction
    need not be linear. However, in the case of clocks, linear predictors are optimal
    or close to optimal for the prediction of clock instablilities modelled by the
    "oscillator noise model" superimposed on frequency drifts and accelerations.</p>
