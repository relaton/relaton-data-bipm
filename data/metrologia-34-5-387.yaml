abstract:
- content: "<p>The absolute wave-number of light from a grating cavity semiconductor
    laser in resonance at 852 nm with saturated absorption spectra of the first resonance
    line D<sub>2</sub>, 6<sup>2</sup>S<sub>1/2</sub> â†’ 6<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2</sub>
    of atomic<sup>133</sup>Cs has been measured with a plane Fabry-Perot interferometer.
    The vacuum wave-number, after correction for the refractivity of air, was found
    to be 11 732,3084(3) cm<sup>-1</sup>. Comparison is made with earlier measurements,
    and the implications of the result for fundamental constant and gravitational
    acceleration determination with laser-cooled atoms are discussed.</p>"
