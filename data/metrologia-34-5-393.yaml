  content: "<p>The reference temperatures of a large number of triple point of water
    cells collected from manufacturing sources around the world have been compared
    at the BIPM and in twelve national laboratories. This allowed an assessment to
    be made of the reproducibility of the realizations of the triple point of water
    and the equivalence of the experimental procedures. The results show that, in
    most cases, the temperatures of the cells agree to within ±0,1 mK. In some cases,
    however, much larger differences and temperature changes were observed, for which
    no obvious explanation has so far been found. The results also provide a comparison
    of a large number of national reference cells.</p>"
