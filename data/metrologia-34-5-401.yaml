  content: "<p>High-accuracy measurements of the density of solid bodies are usually
    performed by the hydrostatic weighing method. In the classical approach the reference
    is the density of the liquid in which the bodies are immersed. The problem of
    computing the best estimate of the measurand and its uncertainty is considered
    here. The complete system of equations can be treated using weighted least-squares
    to estimate the mass and volume of the test objects, and their covariance can
    be found by following a two-step procedure to build the covariance matrix of all
    input quantities. In the last twenty years solid standards have been established
    through direct mass and volume calibrations. Hydrostatic weighings are still used
    to compare the solid standard and the bodies under test. A different equation
    system is built from the experimental data and the evaluation of uncertainty is
    again obtained in the recommended way.</p>"
