abstract:
- content: "<p>The result of a comparison of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized
    He-Ne lasers at 633 nm between the MIKES and the BIPM is reported. The averaged
    frequency difference over absorption components d, e, f, g of the iodine molecular
    transition 11-5, R(127) between laser MRI3 and laser BIPM4 was ν<sub>MRL3</sub>
    - ν<sub>BIPM4</sub> = 1,4 kHz with a standard uncertainty (1σ) s = 0,4 kHz. The
    observed relative frequency stability determined by measurement of the Allan variance
    was 1,4 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for an averaging time of 5000 s. To investigate the
    repeatability of the lasers, iodine absorption cells were installed and measured
    in both laser MRI3 and laser BIPM7, taking laser BIPM4 as the reference. The frequency
    stabilization of laser MRI3 at the fifth harmonic of the modulation was tested.</p>"
