  content: "<p>The result of a comparison of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized
    He-Ne lasers at 633 nm between the MIKES and the BIPM is reported. The averaged
    frequency difference over absorption components d, e, f, g of the iodine molecular
    transition 11-5, R(127) between laser MRI3 and laser BIPM4 was ν<sub>MRL3</sub>
    - ν<sub>BIPM4</sub> = 1,4 kHz with a standard uncertainty (1σ) <italic>s</italic>
    = 0,4 kHz. The observed relative frequency stability determined by measurement
    of the Allan variance was 1,4 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for an averaging time of 5000
    s. To investigate the repeatability of the lasers, iodine absorption cells were
    installed and measured in both laser MRI3 and laser BIPM7, taking laser BIPM4
    as the reference. The frequency stabilization of laser MRI3 at the fifth harmonic
    of the modulation was tested.</p>"
