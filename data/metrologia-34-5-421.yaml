abstract:
- content: "<p>Primary vacuum systems of the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) and
    the Istituto di Metrologia ''G. Colonnetti'' (IMGC) were compared in the pressure
    range 10<sup>-4</sup> Pa to 10 Pa by using spinning rotors as transfer gauges.
    Several rotors were calibrated at both laboratories in an argon atmosphere. The
    results obtained are in good agreement and are within the uncertainty values of
    both the laboratories.</p>"
