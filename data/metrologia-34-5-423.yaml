  content: "<p>The Josephson array voltage standard at the Beijing Institute of Radio
    Metrology and Measurement (BIRMM) has been used in China to realize the volt since
    1992. In order to verify the accuracy and reliability of the voltage standard
    at the BIRMM, a comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards at 1,018 V
    and 10 V between the BIRMM, the Danish Institute of Fundamental Metrology (DFM)
    and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, has been performed. Two Zener
    reference standards were used to transfer the voltage between the three laboratories.
    The results show a difference of less than 2 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup>.</p>"
