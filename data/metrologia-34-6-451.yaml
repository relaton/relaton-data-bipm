abstract:
- content: "<p>We report on an optical frequency standard at λ = 612 nm, which takes
    the form of a He-Ne laser stabilized with respect to molecular iodine by means
    of frequency modulation spectroscopy. The measured frequency stability was σ<sub>0</sub>(τ)
    = 8,7 × 10<sup>-13</sup> τ<sup>-1/2</sup> for sampling times (τ) between 10<sup>-3</sup>
    s and 10<sup>3</sup> s, and the estimated reproducibility was 1,2 kHz. Spectroscopy
    of the R(47) 9-2 transition was performed, and iodine hyperfine constants were
    calculated.</p>"
