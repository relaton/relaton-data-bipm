  content: "<p>The Bayesian method of estimating the mean of a Gaussian frequency
    distribution is applied to the problem of recalibrating a measuring device which
    incorporates a calibrated reference quantity. It is supposed that the recalibration
    is performed by measuring a quantity which has been estimated from other sources
    prior to the measurement. An expression for the joint <italic>a posteriori</italic>
    probability distribution for the measurand and reference quantity is derived.
    This yields <italic>a posteriori</italic> estimates, associated uncertainties
    and the covariance for the two quantities. The estimate of the reference quantity
    so obtained is interpreted as the recalibrated value.</p>"
