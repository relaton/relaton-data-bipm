abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bayesian method of estimating the mean of a Gaussian frequency
    distribution is applied to the problem of recalibrating a measuring device which
    incorporates a calibrated reference quantity. It is supposed that the recalibration
    is performed by measuring a quantity which has been estimated from other sources
    prior to the measurement. An expression for the joint a posteriori probability
    distribution for the measurand and reference quantity is derived. This yields
    a posteriori estimates, associated uncertainties and the covariance for the two
    quantities. The estimate of the reference quantity so obtained is interpreted
    as the recalibrated value.</p>"
