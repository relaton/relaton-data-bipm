  content: "<p>The measurement of pitch in metrology instruments is thought to be
    a benign self-compensating function. In the course of issuing the new scanning
    electron microscope standard SRM 2090, a new algorithm for the measurement of
    pitch was developed. This is based on linear regression models. For a pitch measurement,
    a regression line is traditionally fitted to each edge of the data independently,
    then the distance between some arbitrary threshold on that line is determined.
    The new algorithm eliminates the need for a threshold. An evaluation of uncertainty
    of the measurement process is also described.</p>"
