abstract:
- content: "<p>Evaluation of the uncertainty for the measurement of a gauge block
    by optical interferometry is presented. The measurement method which serves as
    the basis for the uncertainty evaluation is consistent with popular measurement
    techniques which apply the method of exact fractions. This uncertainty evaluation
    is an example of rigorous application of the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement including treatment of higher-order terms and correlation.</p>"
