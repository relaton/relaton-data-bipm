abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of a comparison of two of the BIPM iodine-stabilized Ar<sup>+</sup>
    laser systems at λ ≈ 515 nm are presented. One of these laser systems uses the
    traditional third-harmonic locking technique while the other is realized using
    high-frequency modulation techniques. The frequency stability found in terms of
    the relative Allan standard deviation was 1,3 × 10<sup>-12</sup> τ<sup>-1/2</sup>
    for τ &lt; 100 s, with a minimum of 1,5 × 10<sup>-13</sup> at about 100 s. This
    limit is believed to be set by imperfections in the servo electronics for the
    laser using the third harmonic technique. The frequency difference between the
    two lasers was measured for the a<sub>3</sub> component of the P(13) 43-0 transition
    over a period of twelve days. The mean frequency difference was found to be 0,1
    kHz with a sample standard deviation of 1 kHz. The influence on the laser frequency
    of the modulation index, iodine pressure and laser power are discussed.</p>"
