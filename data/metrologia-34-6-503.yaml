  content: "<p>There is a growing requirement for an internationally accepted system
    of recognition of measurement capabilities and relationships within and among
    countries, to facilitate seamless global commerce and trade. As a result, metrologists
    world-wide have recently developed increased interest in the concept and definition
    of traceability. Classically, traceability provides a way of relating the results
    of a measurement (or value of a standard) to higher-level standards. Such standards
    are usually national or international standards, and the comparisons used to provide
    the traceability must have well-understood uncertainties. An additional complexity
    arises because all instruments and standards are subject to change, however slight,
    over time. This paper develops approaches for dealing with the effects of such
    time-dependent changes as a part of traceability statements. The use of metrological
    timelines provides a means of effectively visualizing these relationships in a
    statement of traceability. When the rate of change in the measurement process
    is sufficiently small, the approach proposed here is less important. However,
    documented measurement assurance procedures are required at all levels so that
    appropriate uncertainties may be estimated with confidence. When laboratory or
    national boundaries are crossed in the traceability process, other factors come
    into play, and the original concept of traceability can become obscure. It is
    becoming common to hear the term ''equivalence'' used to describe these more complex
    measurement relationships.</p>"
