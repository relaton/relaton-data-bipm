abstract:
- content: "<p>We report the results of a bilateral laser frequency comparison between
    lasers from the National Institute for Laser, Plasma and Radiation Physics (NILPRP,
    Romania: laser RO2) and the Institute of Scientific Instruments (ISI, Czech Republic:
    laser INV3). The main objective was to correlate the results obtained from these
    two laboratories and the previous results obtained by each of these laboratories
    against the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM: lasers BIPM4 and
    BIPMP3). The result of a set of ten direct measurements showed a medium frequency
    difference of Δf<sub>corr</sub> = f<sub>RO2</sub> - f<sub>INV3</sub> = -15,1 kHz,
    with an estimated standard uncertainty (1σ) of s = 2,6 kHz, compared with the
    expected mean value, resulting from earlier comparisons, of Δf<sub>corr</sub>
    = f<sub>RO2</sub> - f<sub>INV3</sub> = -10,7 kHz with s = 7,4 kHz. Once corrections
    were applied, the standard uncertainty (repeatability) of the frequency measurements
    improved from 6,0 kHz to 2,6 kHz.</p>"
