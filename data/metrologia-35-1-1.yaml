abstract:
- content: "<p>When calibrating a sensor, the evaluation of the uncertainty of the
    estimated function is at least as important as the numeric values of the function
    itself. The calibration process usually involves a least-squares fitting, performed,
    for example for a thermocouple, by comparing some voltage readings with corresponding
    temperatures from a reference thermometer. The aim of this work is to encourage
    the use of improved algorithms, based on an extended minimization criterion, which
    can overcome some limitations of the classic method.</p>"
