  content: "<p>When calibrating a sensor, the evaluation of the uncertainty of the
    estimated function is at least as important as the numeric values of the function
    itself. The calibration process usually involves a <italic>least-squares</italic>
    fitting, performed, for example for a thermocouple, by comparing some voltage
    readings with corresponding temperatures from a reference thermometer. The aim
    of this work is to encourage the use of improved algorithms, based on an extended
    minimization criterion, which can overcome some limitations of the classic method.</p>"
