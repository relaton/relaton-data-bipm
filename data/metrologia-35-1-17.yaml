  content: "<p>Geometrical constructions are proposed which minimize residual impedances
    of four terminal-pair (4 T-P) capacitance, resistance and inductance standards
    together with adaptors to other terminal systems. Some standards whose measured
    frequency dependence is small (up to 10 MHz) have been made using surface-mounting
    electronic capacitors. These standards facilitate the traceable calibration of
    4 T-P impedance-measuring instruments. A 4 T-P to single-port adaptor having small,
    measurable residual impedances bridges the gap in calibration traceability between
    low and microwave frequencies. The resistance standards usually used for ac/dc
    transfer up to 1 MHz can also be converted to a 4 T-P definition with another
    adaptor.</p>"
