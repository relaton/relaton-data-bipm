  content: "<p>An optically pumped caesium-beam frequency standard (known as the KRISS-1)
    has been constructed at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science
    (KRISS) and the first measurements of long-term frequency stability have been
    made. Two methods were used to make the frequency standard immune to variations
    in the environmental temperature: an <italic>F</italic> = 4 → <italic>F</italic>'
    = 3 (σ + π)-polarized laser was used as a pumping source, and the difference between
    two sequential error signals was used as a feedback signal in the digital servo
    loop. A frequency stability of σ<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>(τ) = 2.5 × 10<sup>-14</sup>
    at τ = 10<sup>5</sup> s for a temperature variation of 4 °C was achieved with
    the KRISS-1.</p>"
