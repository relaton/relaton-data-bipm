abstract:
- content: "<p>An optically pumped caesium-beam frequency standard (known as the KRISS-1)
    has been constructed at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science
    (KRISS) and the first measurements of long-term frequency stability have been
    made. Two methods were used to make the frequency standard immune to variations
    in the environmental temperature: an F = 4 → F' = 3 (σ + π)-polarized laser was
    used as a pumping source, and the difference between two sequential error signals
    was used as a feedback signal in the digital servo loop. A frequency stability
    of σ<sub>y</sub>(τ) = 2.5 × 10<sup>-14</sup> at τ = 10<sup>5</sup> s for a temperature
    variation of 4 °C was achieved with the KRISS-1.</p>"
