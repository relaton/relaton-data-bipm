abstract:
- content: "<p>The volume magnetic susceptibility of moist air χ<sub>m</sub>(ma) is
    needed to correct the results of certain experiments to vacuum conditions. This
    paper derives an appropriate equation for χ<sub>m</sub>(ma) for which pressure,
    temperature, relative humidity, and carbon dioxide content are variable parameters.
    The derived equation also depends sensitively on the molar susceptibility of oxygen,
    for which the handbook values are inconsistent by about 1.4%. The equation resolves
    this discrepancy in part.</p>"
