abstract:
- content: "<p>An interlaboratory comparison of Josephson voltage standards has been
    made among fifteen national, industrial, and military standards laboratories in
    North America. The comparison was made at 10 V using a set of four travelling
    Zener reference standards. The uncertainty (2Ïƒ) of the comparison is estimated
    to be 17 parts in 10<sup>9</sup>. The measurements of all participants fall within
    this uncertainty, indicating that no significant difference has been detected
    among them.</p>"
