abstract:
- content: "<p>Procedures developed for accurate measurement of amount of substance
    ratios for gas isotopes, as used to improve our knowledge of the Avogadro constant
    and checked for quantitative conformity against kinetic gas theory, were used
    to measure synthetic mixtures of enriched xenon gas isotopes, prepared by (micro)-gravimetry
    as is usual in the preparation of synthetic gas compound mixtures. This allowed
    a totally independent evaluation, on the same samples, of the relative combined
    standard uncertainty of (a) the procedure to perform direct measurements of amount
    of substance ratios of gas isotopes in the redetermination of the Avogadro constant
    and (b) the gravimetric preparation procedure. The results of both procedures,
    mass spectrometry and gravimetry, agree to a relative uncertainty of 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup>
    for amount measurements of the major abundant isotopes. Thus it seems that a direct
    measurement of isotopic gas mixtures (e.g. of natural isotopic composition) is
    now possible for xenon isotopes- and probably also for other gaseous isotopes-
    without necessarily having to rely on ''calibration'' by means of values provided
    by measurements of gravimetrically prepared isotope mixtures. However, synthetic
    mixtures may be needed for validation and verification purposes, in particular
    for quality assurance (QA).</p>"
