  content: "<p>The vacuum wavelengths of hyperfine components of three different rovibronic
    transitions of the B 0<sub>u</sub><sup>+</sup> - X <sup>1</sup>E<sub>g</sub><sup>+</sup>
    spectrum of molecular <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> in the near-infrared were determined
    with a relative standard uncertainty of δλ/λ = 1.3 × 10<sup>-10</sup>. The measurements
    were performed by interferometric wavelength comparison using as standards an
    iodine-stabilized He-Ne laser at 633 nm and a dye laser stabilized to the intercombination
    line of Ca at 657 nm. The vacuum wavelengths of hyperfine component a<sub>10</sub>
    of the R(96) lines of both the (0-14) and (0-15) bands and the component a of
    the P(166) line of the (0-14) band were determined to be 781.488 441 03(10) nm,
    793.527 910 44(10) nm and 790.109 812 76(10) nm, respectively.</p>"
