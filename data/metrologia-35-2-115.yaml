  content: "<p>This paper presents a general formulation of least-squares estimation
    using Lagrange multipliers. It is general in the sense that it takes into account
    the covariance matrix of all measured quantities and allows any known constraint
    to be imposed on the quantities being estimated. The technique may be used to
    estimate parameters of a calibration curve for a transducer taking into account
    the uncertainty and correlation coefficients of the measured stimuli and responses.
    It may also be used to adjust measured fundamental constants to a coherent set
    obeying the appropriate physical laws.</p>"
