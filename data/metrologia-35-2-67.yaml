abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method, using a novel double-ended interferometer, is described
    for the highly efficient calibration of gauge blocks. Unlike the conventional
    Kösters interferometric method, the new method does not require wringing of the
    gauge block onto an auxiliary platen. Although the gauge block length defined
    by International Standard 3650 (Gauge blocks) can be obtained using the Kösters
    method, the wringing operation is a laborious process, which requires skill, sometimes
    causes contact errors and decreases measuring efficiency, and prevents a fully
    automated measuring operation. The new interferometer can also be used as a conventional
    Kösters interferometer by changing some of the optical systems. Thus, after preliminary
    investigations measuring some samples using the Kösters method, we can determine
    an accurate correction value, dependent on the phase shift of light at the reflecting
    surface, to obtain the gauge block length defined by ISO 3650. The results, obtained
    from experimental work and theoretical analysis, show that the combined standard
    uncertainty of a gauge block length up to 100 mm is less than 16 nm, and this
    value is nearly the same as that obtained by the conventional Kösters method.</p>"
