  content: "<p>A 543 nm He-Ne laser stabilized to iodine using modulation transfer
    spectroscopy is described. A beatfrequency comparison between it and a reference
    iodine-stabilized laser showed that it had a stability better than 2 Ã— 10<sup>-12</sup>
    after 140 seconds. The average frequency difference between the two lasers was
    only 12 kHz despite the lasers using different stabilization schemes. Two mechanisms
    for frequency shifts in modulation transfer spectroscopy are discussed, both arising
    from the presence of amplitude modulation on the phase-modulated saturating beam.
    The first is produced by the phase modulator itself and the second when the saturating
    beam propagates through the absorbing medium. For the laser described here, the
    frequency shifts are smaller than the uncertainty of the frequency measurement
    (~10 kHz).</p>"
