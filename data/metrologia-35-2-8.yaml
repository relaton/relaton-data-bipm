abstract:
- content: "<p>An air refractometer has been developed for accurate measurements of
    the refractive index of gases under well-defined conditions. Measurements have
    been performed for dry and moist air at four wavelengths distributed over the
    visible part of the spectrum. The measured values have been compared with values
    determined by modified Edlén's formulae and measured parameters. A fitting procedure
    is described to adjust the humidity dependence and the constant term of the dispersion
    formula so that optimum agreement is obtained. A standard deviation of 3 × 10<sup>-9</sup>
    for the residuals describes the reproducibility of the measurements and the success
    of fitting. For 50 % relative humidity, a standard uncertainty of 10<sup>-8</sup>
    for the fitted formulae is claimed, arising mainly from the uncertainty contributions
    of the air parameters.</p>"
