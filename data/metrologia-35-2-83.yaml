  content: "<p>This paper describes a recent determination of the von Klitzing constant
    and the fine-structure constant by comparisons of values of the ohm as defined
    in the International System of Units (SI), derived from the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) calculable cross-capacitor, and values of the
    international practical unit of resistance derived from the integral quantum Hall
    effect. In this determination, the comparisons were made in a series of measurements
    lasting three years. A small difference is observed between this determination
    and an earlier comparison carried out in this laboratory and reported in 1988.
    The most recent value of the fine-structure constant based on the experimental
    value and theoretical expression for the magnetic moment anomaly of the electron,
    which has the smallest uncertainty of any value currently available, is consistent
    with both of these results. The new value exceeds the 1990 conventional value
    of the von Klitzing constant <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub> by slightly more
    than twice the relative standard uncertainty of the present measurement, which
    is 2.4 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup>.</p>"
