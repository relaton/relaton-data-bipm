abstract:
- content: "<p>A world-wide comparison of gauge block measurement by interferometry,
    decided on by the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition du Mètre (CCDM), has been
    carried out. Four national metrology institutes, each representing one of the
    regional metrology organizations EUROMET, NORAMET, COOMET and APMP, measured a
    set of seven rectangular gauge blocks of steel with nominal lengths between 1
    mm and 100 mm. This paper reports on the results of the comparison and draws conclusions
    with respect to the execution of future CCDM (now CCL) key comparisons.</p>"
