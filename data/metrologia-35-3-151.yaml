abstract:
- content: "<p>The experiment on Time Transfer by Laser Link (T2L2) under development
    at the OCA (Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur) and the CNES (Centre National d'Etudes
    Spatiales) will permit the synchronization of remote clocks. To perform a T2L2
    time transfer, laser stations and a satellite are needed, all equipped with a
    clock and a time-tagging unit. We have the opportunity to put a T2L2 payload on
    the Russian space station Mir in 1999. The T2L2 is based on the propagation of
    light pulses in space. It will make it possible to synchronize remote ground clocks,
    several thousand kilometres apart, with an uncertainty of about 100 ps, and to
    measure the performance of ground clocks having a relative frequency stability
    of about 3 × 10<sup>-15</sup> over the station visibility period (around 200 s).
    Accumulation of the data from several successive passages of Mir will allow a
    stability of about 3 × 10<sup>-17</sup> over ten days to be reached. The uncertainty
    budget of the T2L2 time transfer is analysed, and the on-board optical equipment
    that will allow us to achieve these time-transfer performances is presented.</p>"
