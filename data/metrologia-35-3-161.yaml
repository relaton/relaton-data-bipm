abstract:
- content: "<p>This report summarizes the results obtained by twelve laboratories
    in a comparison of pressure measurement standards in the range 10 kPa to 140 kPa,
    carried out under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related
    Quantities. Measurements were taken in the absolute mode and, by some participants,
    in the gauge mode. Good repeatability and, until near the end, reproducibility
    were observed in the transfer standard. The results displayed significant differences
    between some of the participants beyond those expected from their claimed uncertainties.</p>"
