abstract:
- content: "<p>The optical ray-tracing approach based on the Monte Carlo method was
    applied to evaluate the radiative characteristics of isothermal black-body cavities
    with reflectivities in the intermediate range between diffuse and specular reflection.
    The directional effective emissivities of the cylindro-cone cavities with rectangular-
    and triangular-grooved surfaces were calculated accurately enough for practical
    applications. The superiority of the cavities with grooved surfaces to those with
    flat surfaces can be indicated quantitatively in the specular-diffuse model. The
    effective emissivities of the triangular-grooved cavities are much higher than
    the rectangular-grooved cavites in this intermediate range between diffuse and
    specular reflection. The difference in radiative characteristics between triangular-
    and rectangular-grooved cavities can be explained qualitatively by the decrease
    in the fraction of the ray bundles associated with two reflections inside the
    cavity.</p>"
