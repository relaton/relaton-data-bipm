  content: "<p>This paper presents additional errors resulting from the finite frequency
    band transferred by converters of true root-mean-square value. These errors are
    revealed in a specific way on converting non-sinusoidal signals into dc voltage.
    Approximated expressions, which make it possible to calculate quickly the uncertainties
    for some typical signal waveforms, are given, enabling instrument users to evaluate
    the accuracy of the measurement performed. It is also shown that the precision
    of non-sinusoidal signal measurements depends primarily on the frequency bandwidth.
    The possibility is considered of using the derived expressions in systems with
    automatic correction of measurement results.</p>"
