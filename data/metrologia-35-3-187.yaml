  content: "<p>We present a method for applying the results from a pair of comparison
    measurements, made in two laboratories, to form a confidence interval needed to
    support equivalence statements. Only the usual assumptions indicated in the ISO
    Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement about the interpretation
    of the means and combined standard uncertainties are required. The method is mathematically
    rigorous and can be used to calculate the interval to arbitrary precision for
    any confidence level. It can also include the effects of correlations and degrees
    of freedom. Simple graphical and numerical methods of practical accuracy are presented
    for commonly used confidence levels. The method permits statements for clients
    to be made of the form ''On the basis of comparison measurements [reference] performed
    in the period of [date to date], the results of similar measurements made at [Laboratory
    1] and [Laboratory 2] can be expected to agree to within (Â±<italic>d</italic><sub>0.95</sub>),
    with 95% confidence''. We derive and discuss the first rigorous justification
    for this type of statement.</p>"
