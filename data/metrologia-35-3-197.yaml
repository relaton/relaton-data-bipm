  content: "<p>A comparison of three <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized extended-cavity
    diode lasers has been carried out between the Danish Institute of Fundamental
    Metrology (DFM) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). Two
    of the lasers are stabilized using intra-cavity saturation spectroscopy, the third
    one using extra-cavity saturation spectroscopy. All lasers are locked using the
    third harmonic detection technique on different hyperfine components of the P(33)6-3
    transition. The range of frequency differences measured during the four days of
    the comparison was from -340 kHz to 150 kHz. The large fluctuations are due to
    the poor repeatability of the extended-cavity diode lasers with intra-cavity absorption
    cells (ECL4 and BIREL1-1). The frequency stability and repeatability of the diode
    laser (ECL1) using an external absorption cell is roughly one order of magnitude
    lower in performance than the He-Ne lasers. Using an iodine-stabilized He-Ne laser
    (DK3) as reference and the recommended values given in the practical realization
    of the definition of the metre, we found a mean offset from the expected frequency
    difference between ECL1 and DK3 of -12 kHz and a standard uncertainty of 10 kHz.</p>"
