abstract:
- content: "<p>At the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble
    (France), a beam of neutrons with a well-known wavelength was produced by Bragg
    reflection in a perfect silicon crystal; the velocity of these neutrons was measured
    using a very precise time-of-flight method. According to the de Broglie equation,
    the product of the wavelength and the velocity is equal to h/m<sub>n</sub> ( h
    Planck constant, m<sub>n</sub> neutron mass). From the value of h/m<sub>n</sub>
    determined in this way the value of the fine-structure constant infinity was derived.
    The results of a first series of measurements have already been published. The
    results of a second series are now available. They are in excellent agreement
    with the previous results. The final values following from all the experimental
    data of both series are h/m<sub>n</sub> = 3.956 033 332 (290) × 10<sup>-7</sup>
    m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (relative uncertainty 7.34 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and
    α<sup>-1</sup> = 137.036 010 62 (5 03) (relative uncertainty 3.67 × 10<sup>-8</sup>),
    the uncertainties being one-standard-deviation estimates.</p>"
