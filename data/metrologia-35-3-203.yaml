  content: "<p>At the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble
    (France), a beam of neutrons with a well-known wavelength was produced by Bragg
    reflection in a perfect silicon crystal; the velocity of these neutrons was measured
    using a very precise time-of-flight method. According to the de Broglie equation,
    the product of the wavelength and the velocity is equal to <italic>h</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub>
    ( <italic>h</italic> Planck constant, <italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub> neutron mass).
    From the value of <italic>h</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub> determined
    in this way the value of the fine-structure constant infinity was derived. The
    results of a first series of measurements have already been published. The results
    of a second series are now available. They are in excellent agreement with the
    previous results. The final values following from all the experimental data of
    both series are <italic>h</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub> = 3.956 033
    332 (290) × 10<sup>-7</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (relative uncertainty
    7.34 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and α<sup>-1</sup> = 137.036 010 62 (5 03) (relative uncertainty
    3.67 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), the uncertainties being one-standard-deviation estimates.</p>"
