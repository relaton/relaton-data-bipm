  content: "<p>International comparisons of small gas flow measurements were carried
    out between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United
    States of America and the National Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM) in
    Japan. An NRLM transfer standard package composed of sonic venturis, two pressure
    transducers, and two temperature sensors was calibrated using the NRLM primary
    standard for low gas flows (a gravimetric system) and was brought to the US in
    April 1996. The NRLM transfer standard was compared with the NIST Fluid Flow Group
    piston provers (a volumetric system) using mass flow rates of nitrogen between
    0.4 g/min and 11.5 g/min. The mean differences between the NRLM transfer standard
    and the NIST Fluid Flow Group piston provers ranged from -0.09 % to +0.13 %.</p>"
