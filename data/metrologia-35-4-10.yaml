abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes an experimental setup, based on an optical-fibre
    system, to calibrate infrared photodiodes at 1300 nm and 1550 nm by comparison
    with a cryogenic radiometer. An integrating-sphere radiometer used as a transfer
    standard for optical-fibre power measurements has been characterized and calibrated,
    obtaining an uncertainty of less than 0.1% at these wavelengths.</p>"
