  content: "<p>Photometric units in Australia are currently derived from power measurements
    made with a roomtemperature electrical-substitution radiometer. This basis has
    been transferred to a cryogenic radiometer. The cryogenic radiometer was used
    to calibrate the absolute responsivity of a four-element, planar, transmission
    trap detector (measuring the transmission loss each usage), at laser wavelengths.
    Modelling of the quantum defect then provided a reference for absolute spectral
    responsivity throughout the photometric wavelength range. This was used to measure
    the responsivity of a number of photometers at the mercury green line and to calculate
    correction factors for CIE Illuminant A. The candela so derived essentially agrees
    with our existing unit, maintained on a set of lamps. The trap detector was also
    used to determine the polarization properties of the monochromator.</p>"
