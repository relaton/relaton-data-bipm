abstract:
- content: "<p>A single-element, windowless InGaAs photodetector has been calibrated
    against a cryogenic radiometer using a diode-laser source of wavelength 1296.9
    nm (standard uncertainty u = 0.4 nm). This source differs from the gas lasers
    usually used with cryogenic radiometers in that the beam has an elliptical profile,
    is invisible to the naked eye, is not polarized, and is less spatially coherent.
    We describe the simple adaptations we have made to use this source with the cryogenic
    radiometer. In particular, we use a fibre-optic delivery system to prepare the
    beam, and an anti-reflection-coated window to admit the radiation. The relative
    uncertainty in this method of calibration is estimated to be 0.08% (1Ïƒ). The measured
    response (0.9752 A/W) differs from that obtained from the existing laboratory
    scale by 0.08%.</p>"
