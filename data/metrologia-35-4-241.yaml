  content: "<p>A single-element, windowless InGaAs photodetector has been calibrated
    against a cryogenic radiometer using a diode-laser source of wavelength 1296.9
    nm (standard uncertainty <italic>u</italic> = 0.4 nm). This source differs from
    the gas lasers usually used with cryogenic radiometers in that the beam has an
    elliptical profile, is invisible to the naked eye, is not polarized, and is less
    spatially coherent. We describe the simple adaptations we have made to use this
    source with the cryogenic radiometer. In particular, we use a fibre-optic delivery
    system to prepare the beam, and an anti-reflection-coated window to admit the
    radiation. The relative uncertainty in this method of calibration is estimated
    to be 0.08% (1Ïƒ). The measured response (0.9752 A/W) differs from that obtained
    from the existing laboratory scale by 0.08%.</p>"
