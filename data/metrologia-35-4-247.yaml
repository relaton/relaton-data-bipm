  content: "<p>This paper presents the first results of parametric amplification obtained
    at the Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale G. Ferraris (IEN) at a wavelength of
    633.5 nm in a crystal of lithium iodate, pumped by an argon laser at a wavelength
    of 351 nm and injected by a diode laser at 788.2 nm in the noncollinear phase-matching
    case. Amplified and spontaneous parametric signals around 633 nm were measured
    in a photon-counting setup, at different powers of both the argon and the diode
    laser. This experiment is preliminary to the absolute radiance measurement of
    a thermal source.</p>"
