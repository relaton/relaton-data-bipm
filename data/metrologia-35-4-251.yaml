  content: <p>A standard of illuminance responsivity has been realized on a set of
    photopically-corrected detectors. It is based on the use of a cryogenic radiometer
    for the measurement of radiant power in terms of electrical standards and on a
    spectral responsivity scale established on silicon photodiodes in a "trap" configuration
    to evaluate the photopic response of the detectors. The spectral responsivity
    of the photometers was obtained from the trap detector by comparison using a spectrophotometer
    beam which underfilled both. The spatial responsivity of the photometers was found
    to be non-uniform by up to 1 % and this is a significant source of uncertainty
    in the realization. The measurements of aperture area used visual identification
    of the edges and were corrected for a bias in the visual technique that was demonstrated
    by checks with a similar-sized ring gauge robust enough for contact measurement.</p>
