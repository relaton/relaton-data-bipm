  content: "<p>A new design for a filter radiometer based on a trap detector, a set
    of temperature-controlled filters, and a precision aperture is described. This
    filter radiometer can be used to realize high-accuracy scales for illuminance,
    luminous intensity, and spectral irradiance. The new filter radiometer is an improved
    version of our earlier designs. It has been improved in such a way that the filter
    can be easily and reliably changed. This makes it more suitable for spectral irradiance
    measurements, where lamps usually have to be measured at several wavelengths.
    The results of the characterization of the filter radiometer equipped with a lambda
    filter using two different methods are presented. The results are in agreement
    at the level of 0.3%.</p>"
