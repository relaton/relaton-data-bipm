abstract:
- content: "<p>In a new facility, the use of thermal radiators such as FEL lamps and
    very-high-temperature black bodies as standards of spectral irradiance has been
    extended for the first time down to 200 nm, thus covering the whole air-ultraviolet
    range. This improvement is based on a significant increase of the throughput and
    signal-to-noise ratio of a spectroradiometer and on a large reduction in the effects
    from stray light within this new calibration facility. The reliability of this
    facility is demonstrated in a comparison between calibrations of spectral irradiance
    using a black body with different radiometric temperatures, and in a comparison
    of the calibration of an FEL lamp and a deuterium lamp with the existing scale.
    The uncertainties achieved are as low as or better than those of the standard
    facility in this spectral range.</p>"
