abstract:
- content: "<p>Using a new, high-temperature black-body radiator developed by the
    All-Russian Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI), Moscow, and applying
    newly developed methods and equipment, the black-body-based spectral irradiance
    scale of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Braunschweig, has been
    extended and its uncertainties have been reduced compared with previous results.
    The pyrolytic-graphite Planckian radiator BB3200pg, which can be operated at temperatures
    up to over 3300 K, is presented and characterized along with modifications to
    optimize uniformity and stability. The determination of the radiometric black-body
    temperatures is already well established by measuring the weighted irradiance
    using filter detectors without imaging systems. This method is compared and verified
    with results based on self-consistent spectral irradiance measurements using fast-scanning
    spectroradiometers. In addition, a laser-based method for the determination of
    the radiometric temperature is presented and compared with conventional procedures
    of radiationtemperature measurement. The implementation of this additional method
    into the radiometric chain of the PTB is illustrated. Improvements in the uncertainty
    budget of the spectral irradiance scale are discussed.</p>"
