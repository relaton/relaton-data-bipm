  content: "<p>The set of cryogenic radiometers in the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB) at Braunschweig was recently completed by the addition of a modified LaseRad
    II radiometer. The advantages of the improved facility for measurement of optical
    radiant power are described. The paper outlines the radiometric calibration chain
    of the PTB, including a cryogenic laser and broadband radiometer. The link of
    radiometric units to the International System of Units (SI) volt and ohm in the
    PTB is presented. Results of current direct international comparisons of cryogenic
    radiometers and an internal comparison are summarized. The results demonstrate
    the degree of international equivalence at the lowest level of uncertainty available.
    The international agreement is within 2 Ã— 10<sup>-4</sup>.</p>"
