abstract:
- content: "<p>A series of black-body radiation-temperature measurements has been
    made over the temperature range 1380 K to 3100 K using two different designs of
    pyrolytic-graphite black bodies with calculated emissivities of 0.999. All measurements
    were performed at the All-Russian Research Institute for Optophysical Measurements
    (VNIIOFI) during June 1997. A filter photometer from the VNIIOFI, broadband glass-filter
    detectors from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and narrowband
    interference-filter-based radiometers from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL)
    were used to perform the temperature measurements in either radiance or irradiance
    mode using both black bodies. Across the entire temperature range, the NPL and
    PTB instruments showed consistent results with both black bodies and differing
    geometrical arrangements. Results from the VNIIOFI photometer were also broadly
    consistent for a wide temperature range.</p>"
