abstract:
- content: "<p>To implement the detector-based radiometric scale in the new Medium
    Background Infrared (MBIR) facility at the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST), we have developed an electrical-substitution cavity radiometer
    that can be operated just above liquid-nitrogen temperature. This MBIR active
    cavity radiometer (ACR) utilizes a temperature-controlled receiver cone and an
    independently temperature-controlled heat sink. Being a thermal-type detector,
    low noise and drift of the radiometer signal depends mainly on low-noise temperature
    control of the receiver and heat sink. Using high critical-temperature (T<sub>c</sub>)
    superconducting thin-film temperature sensors in the active control loops, we
    have achieved closed-loop temperature controllability of better than 10 µK at
    89 K for a receiver having an open-loop thermal time constant of about 75 s. For
    a flux level of 1 µW to 10 µW, the rms noise floor over a measurement cycle time
    is below 20 nW. This is the lowest noise level yet reported for a liquid-nitrogen-cooled
    electrical-substitution radiometer, and it is the first demonstration of the use
    of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors in such a radiometer. Potential uses for
    this ACR in the MBIR facility include absolute measurement of the broadband radiance
    of large-area 300 K cryogenic black-body sources, and absolute measurement of
    the spectral radiance of laser-illuminated integrating spheres for improved spectral
    responsivity measurements of infrared transfer standard radiometers.</p>"
