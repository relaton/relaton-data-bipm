  content: "<p>We have constructed a new ultraviolet (UV) radiometry facility at the
    Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF II) at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST). The facility combines a high-throughput normal-incidence
    monochromator with an absolute cryogenic radiometer (ACR) optimized for UV measurements
    to provide absolute detector-based radiometric calibrations in the spectral range
    125 nm to approximately 320 nm. The system can be configured for spectroradiometric
    calibration of photodetectors with completely automated mapping of detector spatial
    and angular responsivity. The facility can easily be adapted for other spectroradiometric
    measurements including transmittance and reflectance and the spectral range can
    be extended to about 50 nm.</p>"
