  content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed
    an infrared (IR) radiant power response scale for the spectral range from 2 µm
    to 20 µm. The scale has been realized on a cryogenic bolometer. The response of
    this bolometer has been determined by multiple ties to a primary standard, the
    NIST High Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer (HACR). These transfers were made using
    three intermediate detectors over three different spectral regions. In addition,
    an independent method was used to determine the relative response of the bolometer
    over the entire spectral range. An IR spectral response scale over the entire
    2 µm to 20 µm range was determined from these measurements, with the interlocking
    nature of the multiple independent measurements providing improved overall confidence
    and reduced uncertainties. The overall scale combined standard uncertainty for
    the entire spectral range of 2 µm to 20 µm is of the order of 0.25 %, with the
    typical combined standard uncertainty of an individual measurement made with the
    bolometer being ~0.8 %.</p>"
