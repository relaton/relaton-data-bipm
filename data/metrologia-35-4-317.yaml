abstract:
- content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) candela is
    maintained via standard photometers which have shown long-term stability of better
    than 0.1 % per year. The detector-based method has allowed us to reduce the uncertainties
    of calibrations and to expand the range of calibration capabilities. There have
    been several new developments in photometry at the NIST. A high-illuminance calibration
    facility has been developed. Four temperature-controlled standard photometers,
    tested for linearity and thermal effects at high illuminances, are used with a
    high-pressure xenon arc source to provide the illuminance scale at levels up to
    100 klx. A flashing-light photometric unit (lx s) has been realized using four
    standard photometers equipped with current integrators, and using two independent
    methods. Calibration services for illuminance meters at high illuminance levels
    and flashing-light photometers are now available at the NIST. Ongoing new projects
    include the development of a detector-based luminous-flux calibration facility
    using a 2.5 m integrating sphere, realization of the total spectral radiant-flux
    scale, and the development of a reference spectroradiometer for colorimetry of
    displays. Calibration services are planned in these areas of photometry and colorimetry
    in the near future.</p>"
