  content: "<p>The Facility for Advanced Radiometric Calibrations (FARCAL) at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD, comprises
    the Medium Background Infrared (MBIR) facility and the Training for Calibration
    Expertise in Radiometry (TraCER), the latter being a classroom setting. The MBIR
    is a 120 cm by 180 cm vacuum chamber with an internal cold shroud and an integral
    roll-out table. The chamber will contain a black-body source and an absolute cryogenic
    radiometer (ACR). Both components are mounted on the roll-out table. Measurements
    will be performed in the MBIR facility that cannot be accomplished using existing
    facilities, including the NIST Low Background Infrared (LBIR) facility and the
    room-temperature non-vacuum radiometric facilities. Initially the MBIR facility
    will be used for 80 K medium background measurements and 300 K ambient background
    measurements.</p>"
