abstract:
- content: "<p>Silicon n-on-p photodiodes with 100 % internal quantum efficiency have
    been studied in the 160 nm to 254 nm spectral range. Preliminary values have been
    determined for the quantum yield of silicon at these wavelengths. Using these
    values, a trap detector is presented for absolute flux measurement in this region.
    The stability under intense 193 nm irradiation, a property of importance in lithography
    and in photorefractive keratectomy, has been measured, and the diodes tested were
    found to be several orders of magnitude more stable than p-on-n diodes tested
    by other investigators at this wavelength. Spatial nonuniformities of the n-on-p
    diodes were found to be less than 1 % at wavelengths of 254 nm and 161 nm.</p>"
