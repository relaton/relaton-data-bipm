abstract:
- content: "<p>A bilateral comparison of photometric units maintained at the All-Russian
    Research Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI) and at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) was carried out within a period of less than one year. The
    main goal of the comparisons was to obtain updated knowledge of the relationship
    between the magnitudes of the units of luminous intensity, luminous flux and photometric
    responsivity as maintained at the two national metrological institutes. The results
    of these comparisons show good agreement well within the stated measurement uncertainties.</p>"
