  content: "<p>Improving the accuracy of the measurement of ultraviolet (UV) radiation
    is one of the most challenging problems facing radiometrists today. The difficulties
    arise in part from the stability and performance of the optical components required
    to make the measurements, such as sources, detectors, filters and diffusers, as
    well as from the relative intensity of the UV radiation compared with the visible
    background. A particular application of note is the need to measure changes in
    the level of terrestrial solar UVB radiation. This is required to assess the effects
    of ozone depletion and the potentially damaging impact on the biological ecosystem.
    To have a meaningful global measurement programme, uncertainties of around 1 %
    to 2 % are required. However, this is less than or close to the quoted uncertainties
    of primary UV spectral irradiance scales maintained by national standards laboratories.
    This paper describes work being undertaken at the National Physical Laboratory
    (NPL) to improve the measurement of UV radiation, in terms of establishing both
    primary spectral emission scales and improved transfer standards. Most of this
    work is centred around improving the design and characterization of filter radiometers.
    The paper presents details on the performance of the components used to construct
    the filter radiometers, as well as that of the complete devices. Calibration of
    the complete filter radiometers has been carried out using radiation from both
    monochromators and tunable lasers, and a comparison of the results obtained by
    the two methods is presented.</p>"
