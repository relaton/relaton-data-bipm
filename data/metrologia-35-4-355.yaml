abstract:
- content: "<p>Using spectrally dispersed synchrotron radiation of continuously tuneable
    wavelength as delivered by the ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) calibration
    facility of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage
    ring BESSY I in Berlin, various types of silicon photodiode have been examined
    for their radiometric performance in the 120 nm to 600 nm spectral range. Their
    absolute spectral responsivity was determined with a typical relative uncertainty
    of 0.7 % using the synchrotron-radiation cryogenic electricalsubstitution radiometer,
    SYRES, as primary detector standard. Particular emphasis has been given to the
    study of radiation-damage effects at wavelengths below 250 nm. In addition, the
    reflectance of the photodiodes was measured to determine their internal quantum
    efficiency. Using a physical model for the internal losses, the mean energy to
    create an electron-hole pair in silicon was derived.</p>"
