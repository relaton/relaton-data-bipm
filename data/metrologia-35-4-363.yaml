abstract:
- content: "<p>A facility for the monochromator-based calibration of transfer standard
    detectors using a cryogenic radiometer has been set up at the National Research
    Council of Canada (NRC). A brief status report is given on this facility, which
    has undergone some modifications since it was first set up in 1994. Measurements
    so far have concentrated on the spectral range 450 nm to 700 nm. The wavelength
    calibration of the monochromator used with this facility is discussed in detail.
    Two types of transfer radiometer have been developed for use with the cryogenic
    radiometer. The original radiometers use a single photodiode and incorporate a
    quartz window. The second type of radiometer is a windowless three-detector trap
    using special 18 mm properties of these two types of transfer radiometer are compared:
    spectral responsivity, uniformity, polarization sensitivity, and linearity. Results
    of calibrations of these radiometers over one to two years are presented. These
    measurements suggest that the long-term reproducibility of the calibrations is
    approximately 0.025% for a single radiometer, but close to 0.01% for a group of
    radiometers. The transfer radiometers can be used to calibrate accurately other
    detectors using auxiliary apparatus. Measurements are presented which suggest
    that the transfer uncertainty is close to 0.01% on average. The accuracy of the
    cryogenic-radiometer-based calibrations can be estimated by linking them to the
    international comparison of spectral-responsivity scales carried out at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures in 1994 under the auspices of the Consultative
    Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR). From this comparison, it is estimated
    that the overall accuracy of the cryogenic radiometer calibrations is better than
    0.05% in the range 450 nm to 700 nm.</p>"
