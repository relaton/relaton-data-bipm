  content: "<p>We have developed a direct optical method for aperture area measurement,
    based on constant, known irradiance over the aperture. The method is described
    and results of test measurements are given, including wavelength dependence of
    the effective aperture area. Systematic uncertainty components are studied experimentally
    to reach a relative uncertainty of 10<sup>-4</sup> for aperture sizes down to
    3 mm in diameter. The most important advantages of the direct optical method are
    that it does not require any reference aperture, it can be applied to apertures
    of any shape, and the calibration setup is similar to the actual use of the apertures
    in filter radiometers.</p>"
