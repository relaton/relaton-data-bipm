abstract:
- content: "<p>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable deuterium
    arc (D<sub>2</sub>) lamps are used in the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet
    (SSBUV) programme as radiometric standards in the 200 nm to 250 nm wavelength
    region. These lamps are inherently less stable than the quartz-halogen tungsten
    filament (FEL) lamps used in the programme for calibration at longer wavelengths.
    In order to monitor changes in the D<sub>2</sub> lamp output, the SSBUV D<sub>2</sub>
    lamp irradiance measurements have been compared with FEL lamp irradiance measurements.
    Techniques have been developed to reduce noise in the SSBUV measurements and to
    analyse the stability of the FEL lamps. The D<sub>2</sub> lamp irradiance drifts
    have been found to be as large as -13% at 200 nm relative to 250 nm over a period
    of about seven years. These independently-derived D<sub>2</sub> lamp irradiance
    drifts agree with the NIST measurements of the SSBUV lamps, confirming the long-term
    stability of the NIST working standards for lamp irradiance in the 200 nm to 250
    nm wavelength region. The D<sub>2</sub> lamp irradiances used for the SSBUV calibrations
    are those reported by the NIST, corrected for the lamp drift at the time of the
    instrument calibration. These derived D<sub>2</sub> lamp irradiances not only
    fill long-term gaps for which no updated NIST calibrations are available, but
    also allow any short-term changes to be traced in situ from a NIST calibration
    to the user's laboratory, thus improving the accuracy of the SSBUV instrument's
    calibration.</p>"
