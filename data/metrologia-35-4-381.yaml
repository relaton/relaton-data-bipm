  content: "<p>The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) programme uses 1000
    W, quartz-halogen, tungsten coiled filament (FEL) lamps as the primary radiometric
    calibration source in the 250 nm to 405 nm wavelength region. The National Institute
    for Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends using the product of a fifth-order
    polynomial and a Planck function as a fitting function for interpolating the NIST-calibrated
    FEL lamp irradiances to users' wavelengths. The NIST fitting procedure can result
    in more than a 1% overshoot in some data sets. This problem is related to the
    unconstrained properties of the fifth-order polynomial. Overshooting during lamp
    irradiance interpolation gives rise to corresponding errors in the SSBUV calibration
    and solar spectral irradiance measurements. Errors of this magnitude are unacceptably
    large for the SSBUV, and we have therefore developed a new interpolation scheme.
    A new fitting procedure has been developed to replace the NIST procedure in the
    SSBUV calibrations. Although it uses fewer fitting parameters, the new fitting
    function provides a better fit than the NIST fitting function does. The overshoot
    problems experienced with the NIST procedure do not exist in the newly interpolated
    lamp irradiances. We have also investigated the properties of the NIST FEL lamp
    interpolation scheme in the visible and near-infrared ranges, finding that the
    overshoot problem experienced in the ultraviolet extends into these regions, with
    potential errors of the order of 0.5% to 1%.</p>"
