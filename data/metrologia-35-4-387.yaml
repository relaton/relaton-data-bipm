abstract:
- content: "<p>This article gives the results of the measurements of the Institut
    National de Metrologie (INM) LaseRad cavity reflectance. These measurements were
    performed at several laser wavelengths: 325 nm, 488 nm, 514 nm, 543 nm, 633 nm
    and 1550 nm. The comparison of our measurements at 633 nm with those carried out
    by Cambridge Research &amp; Instrumentation, Inc. (USA) five years ago shows satisfactory
    agreement. The discrepancy between these two measurements is within the measurement
    uncertainties in the range of 5 × 10<sup>-5</sup>. The change in the reflectance
    with wavelength is not negligible. The reflectance varies from 2.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup>
    to 1.10 × 10<sup>-4</sup>, according to the wavelength.</p>"
