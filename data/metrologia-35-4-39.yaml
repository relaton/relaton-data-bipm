abstract:
- content: "<p>Infrared remote sensing has become an important tool for studies of
    Earth resources, the environment and related issues. It is now well recognized
    that measurements in this field have to be accurately traceable to SI radiometric
    units in order to be comparable world-wide and reliable in the long term - in
    particular if the measurements are to detect small changes of key quantities.
    To provide a highly stable standard source of infrared radiation, the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, has investigated the uncertainties of its double-heatpipe
    large-area black body for radiometric calibrations in the wavelength range from
    1 µm to 50 µm. The spectral emission of the black body can be traced either to
    the International Temperature Scale ITS-90 or to the radiation thermometry cryogenic
    radiometer, with small uncertainties of about 50 mK at a black-body temperature
    of about 1000 C. The total relative standard uncertainty of the black body used
    as an irradiance standard in the infrared is less than 10<sup>-3</sup> for wavelengths
    between 1 µm and 15 µm and at most a few times 10<sup>-3</sup> for wavelengths
    up to 50 µm. With a more sophisticated treatment of diffraction corrections and
    cryogenic shielding of background radiation, the uncertainties can be reduced
    to a few parts in 10<sup>4</sup> for high-precision applications.</p>"
