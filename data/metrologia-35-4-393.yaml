  content: "<p>Josephson tunnel junctions have recently proved to be fairly sensitive
    photodetectors over a broad range of wavelengths. This paper shows the results
    obtained with Nb/Al-AlO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/Nb Josephson junctions at
    4.2 K irradiated via an optical fibre and laser light at Î» = 633 nm and 690 nm.
    The responsivity of the devices is about 50 V/W and is linear over several decades.
    Moreover, stacks of two Josephson junctions are shown to have twice the responsivity
    of a single junction. A thermal model of the device is considered and the responsivity
    is calculated as a function of the temperature derivative of the energy gap, the
    thermal parameters of the junction, and the modulation frequency of the incident
    beam.</p>"
