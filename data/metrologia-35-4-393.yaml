abstract:
- content: "<p>Josephson tunnel junctions have recently proved to be fairly sensitive
    photodetectors over a broad range of wavelengths. This paper shows the results
    obtained with Nb/Al-AlO<sub>x</sub>/Nb Josephson junctions at 4.2 K irradiated
    via an optical fibre and laser light at Î» = 633 nm and 690 nm. The responsivity
    of the devices is about 50 V/W and is linear over several decades. Moreover, stacks
    of two Josephson junctions are shown to have twice the responsivity of a single
    junction. A thermal model of the device is considered and the responsivity is
    calculated as a function of the temperature derivative of the energy gap, the
    thermal parameters of the junction, and the modulation frequency of the incident
    beam.</p>"
