abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental setup has been developed at the Istituto Elettrotecnico
    Nazionale G. Ferraris (IEN) for the absolute calibration of photodetectors in
    the photon-counting regime by means of correlated photons in parametric fluorescence.
    A nonlinear crystal of lithium iodate is pumped by an argon-ion laser at 351.2
    nm, generating a broadband source of correlated photons from the incoming wavelength
    to the far-infrared. Photomultipliers and solid-state, single-photon detectors
    are employed, operating in the photon-counting regime with very low dark counts.
    Quantum efficiency is measured at 633 nm. The results show the correlated photons
    to be a promising technique for radiometry. The advantages of this as opposed
    to a conventional method at low power levels are shown.</p>"
