  content: "<p>A new, fast method for broadband secondary calibrations of photodiodes
    against a calibrated reference diode has been developed. It is based on a Fourier-transform
    spectrometer (FTS) and does not require any exchange of the light source, grating
    or higher-order filter. With the present set-up, it takes only 10 minutes to measure
    the spectral responsivity ratios of three unknown photodiodes compared with a
    reference photodiode from 200 nm to 1000 nm. The estimated uncertainty of 0.05%
    of the responsivity ratios was confirmed by independent measurements using intensity-stabilized
    laser radiation at twelve wavelengths between 238 nm and 1000 nm. The combination
    of the uncertainties of the new secondary FTS calibration method and those of
    the reference diode's primary calibration at the cryogenic radiometer shows that
    an efficient, practicable way has been found to provide customers with photodiodes
    as working standards of spectral responsivity for wavelengths from 1000 nm to
    200 nm with uncertainties of 0.05% to 0.2% (near-infrared and visible to ultraviolet).</p>"
