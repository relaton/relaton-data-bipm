  content: "<p>The ultraviolet (UV) instability of silicon photodiodes is a very complex
    phenomenon. The change in spectral responsivity after UV exposure can depend on
    the level of irradiance and total radiant exposure, duration of exposure, wavelength
    of the UV radiation, the type of photodiode, and the way the photodiode was stored
    and used before UV exposure. For a systematic investigation, the responsivity
    change must be determined not only at the wavelength of UV exposure but throughout
    the whole spectral range in which the photodiode is used. Obviously, a fast method
    is needed to perform corresponding measurements over a wide range of parameters.
    Therefore a new, fast and accurate technique based on Fourier-transform spectroscopy
    was used to study the UV stability of silicon photodiodes in detail. Results are
    presented for different types of silicon photodiodes (Hamamatsu S1337 and S5227
    diodes, a novel PtSi-n-Si Schottky photodiode, and UVG and AXUV photodiodes from
    International Radiation Detectors).</p>"
