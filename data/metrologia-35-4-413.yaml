abstract:
- content: "<p>The study reported here was carried out as part of an international
    comparison of cryogenic radiometers, using silicon trap detectors as transfer
    instruments. Nonlinearity measurements are part of a more general characterization
    process of these detectors, including, among other parameters, spatial uniformity,
    temperature coefficient, sensitivity to beam polarization, and stability. When
    calibrated against cryogenic radiometers, the uncertainty in their calibration
    is of the order of 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup>. The accuracy in the nonlinearity
    measurements should therefore be better than this value.</p>"
