abstract:
- content: "<p>During an international comparison of radiation temperature measurements
    performed at the AllRussian Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI),
    Moscow, in June 1997 by participants from the VNIIOFI, the National Physical Laboratory
    (NPL), Teddington, and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Braunschweig,
    detailed measurements of the characteristics of two different types of high-temperature
    black-body source took place. Both of the black bodies consisted of a pyrolytic-graphite
    cavity and differed only in the design of the electrodes, which were either axial
    or coaxial. All investigations were carried out covering a temperature range from
    1380 K to 3100 K. The electrical characteristics of the black bodies were investigated
    at all temperature points; and measurements of the temperature drift were performed
    to determine the stability of the systems in constant-current mode and in optical-feedback
    control mode. The uniformity of the black-body radiation field was measured in
    the radiance mode by using narrowband, interference-filter-based radiometers with
    imaging optics from the NPL and in the irradiance mode by using broadband-filter
    detectors from the PTB to scan the irradiated area. The results confirm the suitability
    of the BB3200 for both radiance and irradiance measurements at national metrological
    institutes.</p>"
