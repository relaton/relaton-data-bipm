  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Based on extensive investigations of almost 100 high-power quartz-halogen
    lamps covering thirteen different types, seven different manufacturers and different
    batches with a total operating time of about 27000 h, a new type of lamp (1000
    W T6 modified FEL-type lamp, Osram Sylvania Inc.) has been selected and its operating
    conditions have been optimized. This lamp, which after seasoning is about ten
    times more stable than the best lamps used before, is recommended as a reference
    and transfer standard of spectral irradiance in the whole range between 250 nm
    and 3 µm. While excellent short-term and long-term stability over operating times
    of several hundreds of hours can be achieved, the disadvantages of the new standard
    lamp lie in a long seasoning time (80 h to 100 h) and a noticeable sensitivity
    of the seasoned lamps to shock and vibrations. Typical results of the characterization,
    calibration and reproducibility of the new standard lamp are presented and discussed
    in order to illustrate its performance and to demonstrate how to use it under
    optimal operation conditions.</p>"
