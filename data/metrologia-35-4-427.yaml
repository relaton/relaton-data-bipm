abstract:
- content: "<p>Band filter radiometry has recently become popular. Its application
    for detector-based spectral-irradiance measurements requires improved characterization
    of standard lamps. This paper presents an approximation function for the spectral
    irradiance of NPL/GEC and FEL lamp data, reported in the 1990 international comparison
    measurements of the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR).
    Characterization with a minimum number of parameters, applicable within the visible
    spectral range, is attempted. Since the spectral emissivity of tungsten is nearly
    linear in the spectral range from 400 nm to 900 nm, the irradiance of the standard
    lamps was approximated with three parameters, representing a linear polynomial
    multiplied by the Planck function. The same linear polynomial was used for each
    lamp of the same type, and was fitted only for temperature and intensity. The
    average difference between the measured and the approximated data was found to
    be less than 0.085 % for the NPL/GEC lamps and less than 0.095 % for the FEL lamps.
    This means that the relative spectral emissivity of each lamp of the same type
    is practically the same. The temperature fitting was characterized by the average
    difference between the measured and approximated data in the ultraviolet and infrared
    spectral ranges.</p>"
