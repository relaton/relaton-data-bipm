abstract:
- content: "<p>High-power quartz-halogen lamps have been in use as transfer standards
    for a long time. However, even the best lamps available are not stable enough
    to match the increasing requirements stemming from the progress of measuring techniques.
    In particular, long-term stability in the ultraviolet-B region has to be improved.
    In order to achieve higher stability, it is necessary to change the operating
    conditions from constant-current to a detector-controlled system. The new OMTec
    transfer-standard system, consisting of a control unit including power supply
    and a lamp detector unit, is described. Its main features are: long-term stability
    with a deviation of the spectral radiant flux from the calibration values of less
    than 3 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> during nearly 400 hours of operating time
    throughout the spectral range from the ultraviolet-B to the near-infrared; continuous
    check on stability by monitoring and viewing the measured detector photocurrents;
    reduction of the required seasoning time by a factor of three thus enhancing the
    lifetime of the lamp; storage of lamp and calibration data in the lamp detector
    unit for external use.</p>"
