  content: "<p>Originally developed for application with laser beams, trap detectors
    are widely used as transfer standards in modern monochromator radiometry. However,
    a non-optimized beam focus applied to trap detectors can result in significant
    spectral errors. This paper shows that a defocused and improperly aligned beam
    entering a Si reflection trap detector can cause an apparent modification of the
    measured relative spectral responsivity. This is true especially in the ultraviolet
    (UV) region of the spectrum, where the measured relative differences are of the
    order of several percent due to the significant influence of the direct band-band
    transitions of Si on the reflectance of the Si photodiode. The spectral range
    from 248 nm to 600 nm was investigated in detail. Calculated curves, simulated
    by a computerized geometrical model, were fitted to the measured data. The geometrical
    model uses experimental spectral reflectance data.</p>"
