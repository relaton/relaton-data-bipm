  content: "<p>Trap detectors are useful transfer standards well-suited to modern
    absolute radiometry. A potential problem with them is that cryogenic radiometers
    allow only small-diameter laser beams to enter the absorber cavity. This can significantly
    increase nonlinearity effects of the trap detectors even at radiant power levels
    below 1 mW. The results of nonlinearity investigations at 633 nm of Si reflection
    trap detectors are presented. Four types of trap were studied: the commercially
    available QED100 and QED200, and constructed traps using Hamamatsu S1227-1010BN
    and S1337-1010BN photodiodes. The quantum efficiency was investigated as a function
    of radiant power as well as of the bias voltage and beam diameter.</p>"
