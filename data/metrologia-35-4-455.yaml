- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>This work analyses the reflectance of silicon photodiodes as a function
    of incident beam polarization, angles of incidence and acceptance, and thickness
    of the passivating layer. The contributions of these effects to the polarization
    sensitivity of real trap devices are considered. An analytical model is used to
    calculate changes in responsivity due to polarization in traps with angular misalignments
    and traps constructed from different types of silicon photodiode. The results
    show that sensitivity to polarization should be considered when high-accuracy
    measurements are required.</p>"
