- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>One of the major uncertainties associated with radiance and irradiance
    measurements stems from the aperture system and a knowledge of the aperture area.
    High-quality apertures, with a roundness of 0.1 µm, can now be manufactured by
    diamond-turning techniques. The quality of these high-precision apertures is such
    that their geometrical diameter can then be measured with an uncertainty of 0.05
    µm using the internal-diameter measuring machine developed at the National Physical
    Laboratory (NPL), UK. Optical techniques have also been developed at the NPL and
    the World Radiation Center (WRC), Switzerland, so that the ratio of the radiometric
    areas of two apertures can be determined and this ratio compared with the geometrical
    ratio as calculated from their diameters. Results are presented of these comparisons
    using apertures from the NPL and the WRC.</p>"
