  content: "<p>State-of-the-art in the application of the Monte Carlo method (MCM)
    to the computational problems of optical radiometry is discussed. The MCM offers
    a universal technique for radiation transfer modelling based on the stochastic
    approach. Developments of the original MCM algorithms and software for calculation
    of effective emissivities of black bodies, absorption characteristics of cavity
    radiometers and photometric properties of integrating spheres are used for designing
    advanced optical instruments. The capabilities of the developed software are illustrated
    by several examples. The techniques of convergence improvement and special time-saving
    algorithms are outlined.</p>"
