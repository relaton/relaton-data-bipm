abstract:
- content: "<p>The Absolute Integrating-Sphere Method was developed and introduced
    by the NIST for the realization of the luminous-flux unit using an integrating
    sphere rather than a goniophotometer. The total luminous flux of a lamp inside
    the sphere is calibrated against the known amount of flux introduced into the
    sphere from the external source through a calibrated aperture. The key element
    of this method is the correction for the spatial nonuniformity of the integrating
    sphere, which has been made possible by a technique using a scanning-beam source.
    This method is to be applied directly to routine calibration measurements of luminous
    flux. A new luminous-flux calibration facility with a 2.5 m integrating sphere
    has been recently completed at the NIST and will allow the calibration of test
    lamps with no need for luminous-flux standard lamps. Calibrations will be performed
    based on the illuminance measurement of the external source by standard photometers.
    This method makes the luminous-flux calibration a detector-based procedure, thereby
    eliminating the uncertainties associated with the use of standard lamps while
    achieving lower uncertainties by shortening the calibration chain. The characteristics
    of the new integrating sphere obtained by computer simulation and measurements
    are reported.</p>"
