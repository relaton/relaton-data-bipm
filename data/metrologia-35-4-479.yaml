abstract:
- content: "<p>A radiometric source facility is being constructed with narrowband,
    widely tuneable lasers covering the wavelength range 200 nm to 12 µm. The laser
    beam will pass into an integrating sphere and the output will be large-area, highly
    uniform, and monochromatic. This facility will be used to make a wide variety
    of radiometric measurements, such as radiant power, radiance, irradiance, transmittance
    and reflectance.</p>"
