  content: "<p>InSb radiometers have been developed and characterized for use as transfer
    standards at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The InSb
    radiometers will hold a portion of the recently realized infrared spectral response
    scale of the NIST and will serve as working standards for the calibration of test
    detectors. These radiometers will measure radiant power or irradiance from 2 µm
    to 5.4 µm. They have a 17° field-of-view. The InSb detectors were selected for
    high shunt impedance to achieve high sensitivity. The transimpedance-gain, voltage-gain,
    and loop-gain of the current-to-voltage converters were optimized for optical
    radiation chopped at 40 Hz. At the peak response, the noise-equivalent-power is
    0.6 pW in an electrical bandwidth of 0.3 Hz. The ratio of the dc ambient-background
    current to the ac noise-equivalent current is 10<sup>7</sup>. Spatial and angular
    responsivities, linearity, stability, and flashing were also characterized.</p>"
