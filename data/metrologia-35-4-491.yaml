  content: "<p>For almost a decade, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has supplied to its customers calibrated photodiode standards and special
    tests of photodetectors for absolute spectral responsivity from 200 nm to 1800
    nm. During this time spatial responsivity measurements have been made on several
    dozen Hamamatsu silicon S1337-1010BQ photodiodes. We have found that the spatial
    responsivity changes with wavelength, sometimes significantly as the wavelength
    approaches the bandgap. The most significant changes appear to be caused by defects
    in the photodiode material and are not apparent over most of the wavelength region
    where the photodiode operates. The change in spatial uniformity with wavelength
    can significantly contribute to measurement uncertainties. These measurements
    have been repeated and the spatial responsivities have remained constant over
    several years. Measurements have also been made on other types of Si, GaN, Ge,
    and InGaAs photodiodes. The measurement equipment, method, and results are presented.</p>"
