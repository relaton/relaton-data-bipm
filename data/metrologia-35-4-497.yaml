abstract:
- content: "<p>The uncertainty in the measurement of aperture area can limit high-accuracy
    radiometric and photometric measurements. Relative total uncertainties in some
    measurements have now been determined at or below the 0.1% level, making substantially
    smaller aperture-area measurement uncertainties necessary. The National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recently implemented an absolute aperture-area
    measurement facility and a relative aperture-area measurement facility; the two
    facilities together are designed to determine aperture areas with low uncertainty.
    The absolute instrument measures the aperture-area using optical edge detection,
    along with high-precision positioning of the optical edge relative to the sensor,
    resulting in an expected relative combined standard uncertainty of less than 10<sup>-4</sup>.
    The relative instrument uses optical flux transfer to compare aperture areas and
    also has an expected relative combined standard uncertainty of less than 10<sup>-4</sup>.
    The absolute instrument will be used to measure the area of standard apertures
    for use with the relative instrument.</p>"
