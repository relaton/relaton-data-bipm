abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper deals with the radiative calibration aspects of high-heat-flux
    sensors using black-body radiation. In the last two years, several heat-flux sensors
    were calibrated up to 50 kW/m<sup>2</sup> using a 25 mm diameter aperture variable-temperature
    black body and a reference room-temperature electrical-substitution radiometer.
    Tests on a typical Schmidt-Boelter heat-flux sensor showed long-term repeatability
    of calibration is within 0.6%. Plans for extending the present calibration capability
    to 100 kW/m<sup>2</sup> are discussed.</p>"
