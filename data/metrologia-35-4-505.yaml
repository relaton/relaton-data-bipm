abstract:
- content: "<p>A portable thermal-infrared transfer radiometer (TXR) has been developed
    for use in comparisons and scale verifications of sources used to calibrate thermal-infrared
    (TIR) channels of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)
    Earth Observing System (EOS) flight instruments. The TXR is designed to measure
    the radiance temperature of large-area black-body sources in cryogenic vacuum
    environments, either at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    or at the EOS instrument-calibration facilities. It can be operated in ambient
    conditions of room temperature and pressure, or in EOS instrument thermal/vacuum
    chambers at temperatures as low as 77 K. The TXR is a liquid-nitrogen-cooled filter
    radiometer with two channels: one centred at 5 µm based on a photovoltaic InSb
    detector, and the other centred at 10 µm based on a photovoltaic HgCdTe (MCT)
    detector. The spectral, spatial and temporal characterization of the TXR using
    state-of-the-art NIST ambient-infrared instrumentation is reported.</p>"
