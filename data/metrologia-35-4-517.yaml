  content: "<p>This paper describes a general, stability-measurement method for the
    short-term stability, or repeatability, of radiometers using fixed-point black
    bodies as radiation sources. A germanium photodiode was used as the detector in
    the radiometer. The radiance during the melts and freezes was measured five times
    for a total of 14 h to 18 h with the radiometer for each black body. The undercooling
    of the freeze was used as a reference signal to establish a common temporal scale
    for the five data sets. The average of the standard deviations of the five measurements
    at each time determined the component of the standard uncertainty associated with
    the short-term stability. This uncertainty includes the instability of the radiometer
    and the black-body radiance as a function of time. Four black bodies were measured
    with the radiometer. The repeatability of the output signal was found to be 0.006%
    to 0.002% in the optical power range from about 2 nW to 2 ÂµW. The repeatability
    determined by using this method may be considered as an upper limit of the short-term
    repeatability of the germanium radiometer.</p>"
