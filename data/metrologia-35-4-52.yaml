abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured the thermal conductivity of polyimide rod at temperatures
    from 2.4 K to 8 K, and the specific heats of polyimide rod and a black paint at
    2.4 K and 4.4 K. It is shown that the responsivity and time constant of cryogenic
    radiometers can be significantly improved by the use of a polyimide film as the
    heat link. This study will help future development of highly sensitive absolute
    cryogenic radiometers.</p>"
