  content: "<p>A low-temperature, composite silicon bolometer was tested for use as
    a highly sensitive infrared detector in spectrometric setups. The sensitivity
    of the detector was calculated as a function of the cryogenic temperature, the
    continuous background, and chopped-signal radiation. Based on this result, a new
    technique was used to characterize the linearity of bolometer sensitivity. The
    characteristic feature of this technique is that the bolometer is exposed to superimposed
    beams of chopped and continuous radiation. The intensity of both beams can be
    varied over a wide range, closely simulating the actual operation of the bolometer.
    Since the effect of the changing background radiation is not distinguishable from
    the effect of a shift in the reference temperature of the Dewar, or of other environmental
    factors, they can be modelled together by continuous radiation alone. The results
    are given. This technique can be used for any thermal detector if both the ac
    and dc electrical signals corresponding to the chopped and background radiation,
    respectively, are available together or separately. The correction factors refer
    only to the actual resistance of the bolometer. These factors determined by the
    new method for every combination of the two electrical signals can be applied
    even with unstable reference temperature or environmental factors. The same setup
    was used to determine the frequency response of the bolometer. The results show
    good agreement with the calculated value of sensitivity as a function of frequency.</p>"
