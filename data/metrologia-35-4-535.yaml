  content: "<p>A new primary spectral responsivity scale has been established in the
    ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions (200 nm to 400 nm and
    0.9 µm to 2.5 µm) at an uncertainty level of less than 0.5% (2σ) over most of
    this range. The new scale is maintained on solid-state transfer standard detectors
    which were calibrated traceable to the NPL cryogenic radiometer via spectrally
    flat pyroelectric detectors using monochromatic radiation from both laser and
    monochromator sources. The UV scale was established on GaAsP detectors while the
    NIR scale is based on InGaAs (0.9 µm to 1.64 µm) and modified InSb/sphere detectors
    (1 µm to 2.5 µm). This paper discusses the choice of the new transfer standard
    detectors, describes how the new scale was established, and analyses the component
    uncertainties which contribute to the total uncertainty associated with the new
    scale.</p>"
