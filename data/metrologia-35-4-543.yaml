abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes the establishment of a high-accuracy, infrared,
    spectral responsivity scale in the 8 µm to 12 µm atmospheric window through the
    calibration of specially designed HgCdTe/sphere detectors. The scale has been
    established using intensity-stabilized laser radiation from a grating-tuned CO<sub>2</sub>
    laser directly with the primary standard cryogenic radiometer of the UK National
    Physical Laboratory (NPL). The factor-of-10 improvement in the uncertainty over
    the NPL's previous spectral responsivity scale in this spectral region has been
    achieved mainly through the use of improved transfer standard detectors and the
    direct calibration of these detectors against the cryogenic radiometer. This paper
    describes these new transfer standards, the intensity-stabilized CO<sub>2</sub>
    laser facility, its use with the NPL cryogenic radiometer and the improved methodology.</p>"
