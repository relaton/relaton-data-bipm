abstract:
- content: "<p>Near-ambient-temperature black-body sources are routinely used for
    calibration in terms of radiance of a variety of infrared instruments such as
    those used in remote sensing and thermal imaging. The black-body radiance is usually
    determined by reference to a measured temperature and a calculated effective emissivity.
    The temperature is measured with one or more contact thermometers positioned close
    to the emitting black-body surface. In this case traceability to the International
    System of Units (SI) is to the kelvin through the ITS-90. This paper describes
    an alternative, more direct method based on the use of absolutely calibrated filter
    radiometers. These filter radiometers form part of a new facility called AMBER
    (Absolute Measurements of Black-body Emitted Radiance) which has been designed
    to determine the radiance of an ambient-temperature black body with an uncertainty
    of about 0.1% (which corresponds to a radiance temperature difference of 25 mK
    at 4 mum) and a resolution of 0.001% (0.3 mK). The facility obtains its traceability
    to the SI directly through radiometric standards in the form of a cryogenic radiometer
    rather than through the ITS-90.</p>"
