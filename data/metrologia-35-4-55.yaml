abstract:
- content: "<p>Filter radiometers are used as transfer standards in many radiometric
    measurements, and essentially comprise a detector, filter (interference or coloured
    glass) and high-precision aperture. An initial study into the use of Fourier-transform
    (FT) spectrometry has resulted in the attainment of medium accuracy (around 0.3%
    to 0.7%) calibration of assembled filter radiometers in a period of a few hours.
    This contrasts with a day for characterization using a grating instrument and
    the weeks required for high-resolution, high-accuracy, laser-based calibration.
    The technique measures the response of the radiometer to be calibrated against
    that of a standard detector, which in this case is a trap detector.</p>"
