  content: "<p>This paper discusses the performance of a range of new detector-based
    transfer standards for the dissemination of source-based scales. The transfer
    standards presented include both detector-stabilized and -monitored sources of
    spectral irradiance and radiance as well as a more radical absolute transfer standard
    spectrometer. The primary aim in developing the new transfer standards is to improve
    traceability and accuracy to the International System of Units (SI) while at the
    same time reducing the cost. Some generic remote-sensing applications are considered
    as examples.</p>"
