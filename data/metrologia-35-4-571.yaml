  content: "<p>The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is to be launched
    with the Earth Observing System EOS-AM1 spacecraft in 1999. Demanding specifications
    include a requirement that the instrument be calibrated, and placed on an accurate
    radiometric scale, to within 3% (1Ïƒ) uncertainty, for incident radiances near
    the upper end of a camera's dynamic range. Contributing factors to the uncertainty
    in radiance measurements include signal-to-noise ratio, goodness of fit of the
    calibration data to a quadratic equation, and quality of the experimental conditions
    (i.e. range and number of radiometric levels used to provide the calibration).
    These sources, as they are identified, are flagged as contributing to the absolute,
    relative band-to-band, relative camera-to-camera, or relative pixel-to-pixel radiance
    uncertainties. This paper summarizes the products and results from the uncertainty
    analysis of radiometric calibrations for the MISR. It also provides an example
    of a geophysical product retrieval that makes use of these data.</p>"
