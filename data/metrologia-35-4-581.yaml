  content: "<p>Uncertainty in the transfer of power responsivity from a cryogenic
    radiometer to a detector arises from several factors. These include the transmittance
    and scatter of the Brewster window present in the absolute power measurement and
    the relative positions in the laser beam of the detector and radiometer. To investigate
    these, the responsivity of a three-element silicon photodiode reflectance trap
    has been determined against a cryogenic radiometer at 488 nm. The responsivity
    measurement was performed in two different positions along the path of the irradiating
    laser beam: firstly in front of the radiometer's Brewster window, and secondly
    in the plane of the radiometer's cavity. The resulting responsivities are compared
    in terms of the significant differences between each measurement technique and
    the uncertainty budget of the two calibrations. In addition, the uncertainty in
    and feasibility of measurements made in vacuum behind the Brewster window and
    in the cavity plane are assessed.</p>"
