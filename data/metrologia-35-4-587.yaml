abstract:
- content: "<p>The uncertainty of measurements is critical in furthering the development
    of radiometric science and acquiring an increased understanding of its principles.
    Proper analysis of measurement uncertainties provides an indication of how well
    the measurements have been made, and also helps assess the results of comparisons.
    Uncertainties are necessary to quantify statements concerning traceability to
    the International System of Units. Three examples in the field of radiometry are
    presented for evaluation. Employing statistical theorems, the combined standard
    uncertainty of the signal integral or the temperature is derived.</p>"
