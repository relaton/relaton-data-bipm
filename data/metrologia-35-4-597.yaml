  content: "<p>The ScaRaB instruments are a series of Earth Radiation Budget radiometers
    of which the first flight model (FM1) was launched on a METEOR satellite on 25
    January 1994. A second model (FM2) was launched on the Russian Resurs satellite
    in July 1998. Results obtained from FM1 indicated the need for more accurate ground
    calibration for FM2 and the spare model. Besides spectral response characterization
    (from 0.2 µm to 50 µm), channel gains and absolute filtered radiance of the on-board
    lamps and on-board black bodies have been measured, using different reference
    sources: laboratory black bodies, an absolutely calibrated integrating sphere,
    and the Sun. The black bodies ensure the validity of the calibrations in the long-wave
    spectral domain, while the Sun and the integrating sphere check the short-wave
    spectral domain. After a brief description of the ScaRaB instrument and its main
    characteristics, this paper describes the procedures and results, including the
    associated uncertainties, for the measurements of the broadband channel gains:
    these need to be accurately calibrated and compared. Points of interest and also
    weaknesses of the three methods are compared in order to lead to the most realistic
    uncertainty budget.</p>"
