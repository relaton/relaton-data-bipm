- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The balance between the incoming solar radiation from the Sun and the
    outgoing reflected and scattered solar radiation and thermal-infrared emission
    from the Earth, the so-called Earth Radiation Budget (ERB), provides information
    on the fundamental energy source of the climate system [1]. To fulfil global coverage
    and sampling requirements, the ERB measurements have to be made from space. Broadband
    measurements are necessary because all spectral regions in both the solar and
    infrared contribute to the Earth's radiative fluxes. The Geostationary Earth Radiation
    Budget instrument (GERB) will be launched on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)
    geostationary satellite in the year 2000. Both short-wave (0.32 µm to 4 µm) and
    total (0.32 µm to 30 µm) radiance measurements will be made, with long-wave (4
    µm to 30 µm) data obtained by subtraction. The accuracy requirements, 1% short-wave
    and 0.5% long-wave, are challenging but consistent with previous radiation-budget
    measurements. The instrument will be characterized and calibrated on the ground
    prior to launch. The radiometric calibration is performed using two black bodies
    and a lamp-illuminated, integrating-sphere source in the near field. In this paper
    we describe the calibration algorithm and procedure.</p>"
