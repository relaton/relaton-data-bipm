  content: "<p>Laboratory measurements of the bidirectional reflectance distribution
    function (BRDF) of diffusely reflecting samples are required to support calibration
    in the Earth Observing System (EOS) programme of the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration (NASA). To assess the ability of the instrument calibration
    laboratories to perform accurate BRDF measurements, a round-robin comparison with
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the central laboratory
    was initiated by the EOS Project Science Office. The comparison parameters, which
    include measurement wavelength, spectral bandwidth, illumination and viewing geometry,
    sample type and alignment, and data format, were selected in consultation with
    the participants. The participants were selected based on their roles as metrology
    laboratories with direct connections to EOS or other international Earth remote-sensing
    satellite programmes. This paper briefly describes the format of the comparison,
    the status of the first round, and some preliminary results.</p>"
