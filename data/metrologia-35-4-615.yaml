  content: "<p>A series of three interagency comparisons of solar-ultraviolet-monitoring
    spectroradiometers was conducted at Table Mountain outside Boulder, Colorado.
    The primary purpose of these comparisons was to compare the solar-ultraviolet
    irradiances measured by all the instruments during synchronized spectral scans.
    In addition, selected instrument parameters important for these measurements were
    characterized. Experimental techniques were developed to perform all these characterizations
    in the field. The comparisons demonstrated that the spectral responsivity of an
    instrument must be determined at its field location with standard lamps calibrated
    from a common scale of spectral irradiance. Using such a common scale and appropriate
    convolution techniques, the measured irradiances from synchronized scans agreed
    to within 2 %.</p>"
