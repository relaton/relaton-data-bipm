abstract:
- content: "<p>The SOLar STellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) is a
    three-channel spectrometer designed for measuring the solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiance
    from 119 nm to 420 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.1 nm to 0.3 nm. The SOLSTICE
    is aboard the NASA Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), which was launched
    on 12 September 1991. The degradation of the SOLSTICE sensitivity is primarily
    tracked in-flight by measuring a set of bright, early-type stars with the same
    optics and detectors and by changing only slit sizes and integration times. While
    the Sun changes by 1% in the near-UV and by as much as a factor of 2 in the far-UV,
    early-type main-sequence stars are not expected to change by more than 1% in the
    UV for long time periods. The ensemble average of the SOLSTICE stellar observations
    indicates that these stars are indeed stable to 2% or better. Since the launch
    of the UARS, the SOLSTICE sensitivity has decreased by a few percent per year.
    We attribute the degradation primarily to ageing of the photomultiplier tubes
    for all three channels and to diffusion of layers in the broadband interference
    filters for the F and N channels. There appears only minor degradation associated
    with optical contamination, mainly because of the strict use of low-outgassing
    materials in the SOLSTICE instrument and maintenance of class 10000 clean rooms
    and oil-free vacuum systems for all pre-flight testing of the instrument.</p>"
