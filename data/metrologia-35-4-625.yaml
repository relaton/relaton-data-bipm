  content: "<p>We discuss a technique for validation of instrument radiometric calibration
    using the surface of Antarctica. The proposed method involves comparing remotely-sensed
    radiances with predictions from a radiative transfer model, and is applicable
    to polar-orbiting instruments measuring in the wavelength range 335 nm to 650
    nm. Coincident ground measurements are not necessary. We have estimated uncertainties
    in the method using existing ground measurements and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometers
    (TOMS) data. Significant sources of uncertainty include ground-measurement accuracy
    (1 %), seasonal and spatial surface variation (0.5 %), and radiative-transfer
    modelling (2 %).</p>"
