abstract:
- content: "<p>A joint campaign was held at Lunar Lake Playa, Nevada (USA) in June
    1996 to evaluate the accuracy of reflectance-based, vicarious calibrations of
    Earth Observing Systems (EOS). Four groups participated in the campaign and made
    independent measurements of surface reflectance and atmospheric transmittance
    on five different days. Each group predicted top-of-the-atmosphere radiance for
    several bands in the 400 nm to 2500 nm spectral range. Analysis of the data showed
    differences of the order of 5% to 10% throughout the spectral region under study.
    Further study revealed that the major sources of discrepancy are differences in
    procedures and assumptions in finding the reflectance of field references used
    to determine the surface reflectance of the test site. Differences caused by varying
    radiative transfer codes and aerosol assumptions were found to be a relatively
    small error source, owing to the high reflectance and low turbidity of the test
    site. Differences in the solar irradiance values used by separate groups were
    found to be significant, but can be overcome by agreeing on a standard solar irradiance
    data set. The results from this campaign were used to plan a follow-up campaign
    in June 1997 that included developing a set of laboratory measurements to characterize
    the field radiometers which measure surface reflectance, and obtaining a consistent
    set of reference-panel reflectance factors. The expectation is that disagreement
    in absolute radiances at the top of the atmosphere generated by these field methods
    will be reduced to less than 3% if further cooperative work between groups is
    carried out to develop approaches which will account better for reference panel
    calibration, the consistent use of atmospheric characterization and radiative
    transfer codes.</p>"
