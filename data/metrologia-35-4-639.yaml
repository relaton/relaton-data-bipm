abstract:
- content: "<p>A new approach is being investigated to facilitate operational monitoring
    of post-launch satellite sensor performance. Airborne hyperspectral data are used
    to provide spatially extended ground-reference data applicable to the spectral
    bands of many sensors. Two rangeland sites in Alberta, Canada, were used for the
    first data acquisitions to test the method. This paper focuses on the data-acquisition
    program and the resulting data sets.</p>"
