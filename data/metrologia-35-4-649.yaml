  content: "<p>An observation strategy is described that uses the Moon to monitor
    the radiometric stability of Earthorbiting remote-sensing instruments without
    requiring precise lunar-radiance measurements over the full range of lunar cycles.
    The Moon can be used as a constant irradiance reference for monitoring on-orbit
    shifts in instrument responsivity if (i) the Moon is observed at equivalent phase
    angles, (ii) the Moon is observed at equivalent sensorMoon libration angles, (iii)
    the Moon is observed at equivalent Sun-Moon libration angles, and (iv) the Moon
    is observed at equivalent scan rates and aspect angles. Irradiance changes due
    to changes in Sun-to-Moon and Moon-to-sensor distance can be precisely computed
    from ephemerides using inverse square scaling. A preliminary model of libration
    effects being developed by the United States Geological Survey from Clementine
    lunar-orbiter measurements was used to evaluate the effects of lunar libration
    in the 400 nm to 1000 nm spectral region. If the satellite platform can be rotated
    to view the Moon from a position in the orbit that exactly provides the required
    lunar phase angle, lunar-irradiance levels for 48 of the 75 lunar cycles in the
    1994-1999 epoch examined can be matched to within 0.1 %. All lunar cycles in the
    epoch have at least one match to within 0.27 %. A pixel integration procedure
    that minimizes calibration uncertainties due to sensor pointing and optics contamination
    is presented and evaluated for the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The total combined relative uncertainties
    between suitable lunar reference pairs are expected to be less than 1 %.</p>"
