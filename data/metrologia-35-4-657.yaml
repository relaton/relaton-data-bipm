abstract:
- content: "<p>We demonstrate the calibration and error estimation for three inexpensive
    pushbroom imaging spectrometers that operate in the visible/near-infrared range.
    The instruments were all built at the Naval Research Laboratory from commercial,
    off-the-shelf components. Although they are similar in basic design, their differences
    reflect the different objectives for which they were built. Each camera presents
    specific difficulties in calculating corrections to achieve uniformity and to
    convert to physical units. The calibration errors of one instrument are dominated
    by uncertainties in the integrating sphere, particularly in the short wavelength
    region. The errors of one of the other instruments, equipped with an intensifier,
    are dominated by camera noise.</p>"
