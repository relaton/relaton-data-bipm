  content: "<p>Total column ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) amount and an aerosol index are
    among the geophysical properties currently retrieved from Total Ozone Mapping
    Spectrometer (TOMS) measurements. The accuracy with which each is retrieved depends
    in part on the characterization of diffuser plates used in the pre-launch instrument
    calibration. We present here the retrieval sensitivities to errors in the measured
    reflectance per steradian of these diffuser plates. In particular, errors in the
    wavelength dependence of the reflectance are much more important than absolute
    reflectance errors. We derive limits for the uncertainty of initial diffuser measurements
    based on reasonable goals for retrieval uncertainties: a relative standard uncertainty
    of 1% in total ozone and a standard uncertainty of 0.5 in aerosol optical depth.
    The maximum allowed 1Ïƒ uncertainty in diffuser reflectance is 0.4% for ozone and
    0.25% for optical depth, assuming that errors at different wavelengths are uncorrelated.
    We also examine TOMS diffuser measurements made at the Goddard Space Flight Center
    (GSFC) in an attempt to evaluate existing diffuser uncertainty components for
    O<sub>3</sub> and aerosol retrievals.</p>"
