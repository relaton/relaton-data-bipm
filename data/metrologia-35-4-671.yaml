abstract:
- content: "<p>SUMER, the Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation instrument,
    is part of the payload of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) which
    began its scientific mission in January 1996. SUMER takes spatially and spectrally
    highly-resolved images of the Sun in the spectral range from 46 nm to 161 nm.
    It investigates structures and associated dynamic processes of the solar atmosphere
    from the chromosphere through the transition region to the inner corona, over
    a temperature range from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> K to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> K. Absolute
    radiance measurements, which are used to derive plasma temperatures and densities
    in the solar atmosphere, require that the spectral responsivity of the instrument
    be known. We describe the radiometric pre-launch calibration of SUMER, which is
    traceable to the electron storage ring BESSY, and the measurements performed to
    confirm and extend the laboratory calibration during the first year of operation.
    These measurements put SUMER in a position to measure at certain wavelengths solar
    vacuum-ultraviolet spectral radiance, and also irradiance, with a relative uncertainty
    of 0.15 (1σ).</p>"
