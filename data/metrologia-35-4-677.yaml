abstract:
- content: "<p>The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) experiment flew eight
    Space Shuttle missions between 1989 and 1996, in order to maintain and validate
    the calibrations of a number of satellite-borne ozone-monitoring instruments.
    The SSBUV sensitivity drifted during each mission. Reversible drifts resulted
    from the outgassing of the optics, while non-reversible drifts were the consequence
    of changes induced by solar UV radiation. These changes varied from mission to
    mission, but were typically less than 1% near 400 nm, increasing to 5% to 10%
    near 200 nm. In addition to using traditional calibration data, the SSBUV solar
    irradiance data were used to assess radiometric sensitivity changes. In the near-
    and mid-UV, short-term solar irradiance variations can be accurately modelled
    using the Mg II index. Therefore, during the course of each relatively brief Shuttle
    flight, the Mg II index-corrected solar irradiance provides a ''constant candle''
    and any changes in the observed solar irradiance result from sensitivity drift.
    Using the Sun as a source, SSBUV sensitivity drifts were modelled via an iterative
    approach as the product of linear functions of outgassing time and accumulated
    solar exposure time. The resulting time-dependent corrections were validated using
    the conventional calibration data and used in conjunction with the absolute radiometric
    sensitivity determined in the laboratory to process the solar irradiance data.
    It is shown that the application of this technique reduces the uncertainty in
    the SSBUV solar measurements associated with radiometric sensitivity drifts to
    approximately 1% at 200 nm.</p>"
