  content: "<p>The determination of the total solar irradiance (TSI) from the SOHO/VIRGO
    experiment is made by first correcting the time series for all a priori known
    influences, and then correcting the data for instrumental degradation, using the
    back-up instruments PMO6-VB and DIARAD-R. The long-term behaviour of PMO6-VA shows
    an exponential decrease in its sensitivity with a time constant of τ = 390 days
    and a 1/e amplitude of 528 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, whereas DIARAD-L exhibits a general
    increase in its sensitivity of about 0.25 × 10<sup>-6</sup>/day combined with
    an early exponential decrease of 405 days and an 1/e amplitude of 65 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.
    After correcting PMO6- VA and DIARAD-L for their degradation, the VIRGO TSI shows
    a minimum around July 1996 and has been increasing since then by about 0.4 W m<sup>-2</sup>.</p>"
