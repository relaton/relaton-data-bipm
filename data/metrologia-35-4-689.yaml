abstract:
- content: "<p>The SOLSPEC instrument was built to measure the solar spectral irradiance
    from 200 nm to 3000 nm. The instrument participated in the three ATLAS missions.
    It consists of three spectrometers, which measure the solar spectral irradiance
    in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared domains. The ultraviolet and visible
    solar spectra obtained during the ATLAS 1 mission have been presented elsewhere.
    Measurements during the second flight are presented in this paper. Most of the
    ATLAS 1 results are confirmed by the ATLAS 2 measurements, but some improvements
    are obtained in certain wavelength domains owing to better calibration procedures
    and selection of measurements. The data gathered during the first two flights
    by the SSBUV, SUSIM and SOLSPEC spectrometers are compared and discussed.</p>"
