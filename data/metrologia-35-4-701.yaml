  content: "<p>A portable transfer radiometer covering the spectral range 400 nm to
    900 nm has been built and calibrated. This radiometer was designed to measure
    the output of spherical integrating sources with large apertures such as those
    used to calibrate spacecraft sensors for the Earth Observing System (EOS) of the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The radiometer is a simple,
    robust, narrowband multifilter instrument using a silicon trap detector. The temperature
    of the filters, apertures, detectors and electronics is controlled slightly above
    ambient. There are no imaging optics and the radiometer throughput is controlled
    by Invar-spaced apertures. The radiometer has been calibrated by two methods.
    First, the radiometer was calibrated in an irradiance mode by use of a National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) FEL lamp. Second, a Solar-Radiation-Based
    Calibration (SRBC) was carried out, in which the radiometer viewed a panel, calibrated
    with a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), illuminated by
    the Sun. Differences between the NIST calibration and the SRBC method for a recent
    solar spectrum are quite small: less than 2.1% for the seven bands between 412
    nm and 868 nm, and well within the estimated uncertainties for the two calibration
    methods.</p>"
