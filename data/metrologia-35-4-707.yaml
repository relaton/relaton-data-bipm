abstract:
- content: "<p>A spaceborne spectral irradiance monitor (SIM) is being developed at
    the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado, to measure
    solar spectral irradiance and its variation for the NASA Earth Observing System
    (EOS) SOLar STellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE). The SIM consists
    of two independent and identical prism spectrometers. Each channel is equipped
    with an electrical-substitution radiometer and additional photodiodes to provide
    spectral coverage from 0.3 µm to 2.0 µm with a resolving power greater than 30.
    One of the spectrometers is used daily, while the other is used on a lower duty
    cycle to account for instrument degradation caused by solar exposure. The prism
    is rotated on a flex pivot and driven with a voice-coil motor. Closed-loop drive
    control and wavelength calibration are achieved by using a concave mirror on the
    prism table to focus a second solar beam onto a linear charge-coupled device (CCD)
    located at the focal plane of the prism. Radiation-induced changes in prism transmission
    are measured in flight by using one of the spectrometers to transfer monochromatic
    light to the other spectrometer. Visible and infrared photodiodes on a flip-arm
    measure the ratio of the beam into and out of the prism, thus measuring the prism
    transmission as a function of wavelength.</p>"
