abstract:
- content: "<p>We present an emf-temperature reference function for platinum versus
    palladium (Pt/Pd) thermocouples in air for the range 0 °C to 1500 °C. The reference
    function is based on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) and
    has an expanded uncertainty (coverage factor of two) of less than the equivalent
    of 11 mK for temperatures up to 1050 °C and rising smoothly to approximately 0.3
    K at 1500 °C. The reference function is based on a set of Pt/Pd thermocouples
    of exceptional stability and homogeneity constructed from Pt and Pd wire of very
    high purity (99.999% mass fraction and 99.997% mass fraction, respectively). Experimental
    results are presented on the thermoelectric stability of Pt/Pd thermocouples at
    high temperatures and on the calibration of Pt/Pd thermocouples based on this
    reference function.</p>"
