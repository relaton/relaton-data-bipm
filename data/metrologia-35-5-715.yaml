abstract:
- content: "<p>The first interlaboratory study of the Consultative Committee for Amount
    of Substance (CCQM) focused on the determination of lead concentration in a synthetic
    water sample. In the framework of the CCQM activities, only leading metrology
    institutes participated in the study. The prescribed analytical method was double
    isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) as a primary method of measurement (PMM).
    At the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) the material
    was additionally analysed by direct IDMS as a primary method of measurement using,
    completely independently, a certified spike reference material. The work described
    in this paper concerns direct IDMS. Conclusions are drawn on the use of IDMS as
    a PMM, on the comparison of the results with those of double IDMS, on the use
    of a certified spike reference material and on the calculation of uncertainty.</p>"
