abstract:
- content: "<p>The noise levels given by spectral analysis are relevant parameters
    for the characterization of the time-domain stability of oscillators. The estimation
    of the noise levels of a sampled signal may be achieved with variances even if
    the sampling frequency is far lower than the high cut-off frequency. The effects
    of spectral aliasing for the white-phase noise are shown and a procedure for estimating
    both white-phase noise level and high cut-off frequency is given in this paper.</p>"
