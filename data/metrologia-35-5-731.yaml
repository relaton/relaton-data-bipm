  content: "<p>We showed in Part I of this paper that the estimation of the white-phase
    noise level of a sampled signal may be achieved with variances even if the sampling
    frequency is far lower than the high cut-off frequency. In Part II, the effects
    of spectral aliasing for the different types of noise are reviewed. The responses
    of the Allan variance and the modified Allan variance for high-frequency noises
    are calculated taking into account the spectral aliasing. It is demonstrated that
    the effects of spectral aliasing for low-frequency noises may be neglected.</p>"
