  content: "<p>EUROMET project #256 was established to compare agreement between laboratory
    calculations of the elastic distortion that piston-cylinder assemblies of pressure
    balances, the primary standard for pressure measurements, undergo when subjected
    to pressure applied via liquid media. The following piston-cylinder assemblies
    were selected for comparison of the calculations: (i) PTB, 400 MPa, free-deformation
    type; and (ii) BNM-LNE, 200 MPa, free-deformation and controlled-clearance types.
    Calculations made at the IMGC using an analytical method were compared with those
    made at the NPL and the PTB, each using a different finite element technique.
    All three methods couple calculation of the elastic deformation of the piston-cylinder
    with calculation of the pressure distribution in the piston-cylinder clearance
    from a flow model. After reviewing the calculation methods, the paper presents
    results for each of the comparison systems. The calculated piston and cylinder
    distortion, annular gap profile, annular pressure distribution, piston fall rates,
    and pressure distortion coefficients are presented and compared with experimental
    measurements. A discussion is presented of the extent of the agreement between
    the calculation methods and what this implies for the reliability of calculated
    distortion coefficients. The comparison also resulted in other useful knowledge
    being obtained, for example on the influence of the cylinder boundary conditions
    and the influence of simplifications adopted in the geometrical model. This information
    will be of use in the application of such calculations to the design of piston-cylinder
    assemblies or prediction of the effect of experimentally measurable parameters.</p>"
