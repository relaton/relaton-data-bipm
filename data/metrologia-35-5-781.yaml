abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the primary methods for pH measurement of Russia and
    Germany was carried out. Three buffer solutions: potassium tetraoxalate, 0.05
    mol/kg, potassium hydrogen phthalate, 0.05 mol/kg and disodium tetraborate decahydrate,
    0.01 mol/kg, prepared from materials of the All-Russian Research Institute for
    Physical, Technical and Radio-Technical Measurements (VNIIFTRI) and Merck KGaA,
    Germany, were used. The pH values obtained at 25 Â°C in this comparison agree within
    an expanded uncertainty of 0.004 for the borate and oxalate buffers and 0.005
    for the phthalate buffer (k = 2).</p>"
