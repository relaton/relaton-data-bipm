abstract:
- content: <p>The lattice parameter of silicon plays an important role in the determination
    of the Avogadro constant and the fine-structure constant. Today, three values
    of the d<sub>220</sub> silicon lattice spacing are available, measured at the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany), the Istituto di Metrologia
    "G. Colonnetti" (IMGC, Italy) and the National Research Laboratory of Metrology
    (NRLM, Japan) and based on the metre scale. Using the PTB lattice spacing comparator,
    the spacings of the different materials were measured and compared with one another
    in order to check the possibility of combining the results to form a common "best"
    value. The characterization of the relevant impurities and crystal defects and
    their number densities are discussed and corrections applied for their influences
    on the interatomic distances. The NRLM data are in disagreement with those of
    the PTB and the IMGC, from which a lattice parameter for a hypothetical, ideal,
    perfect Si crystal was derived with a relative uncertainty of about.</p>
