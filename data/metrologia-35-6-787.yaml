abstract:
- content: "<p>Statistical tests are given for the detection of corruption in the
    Gaussian process underlying the measurement of temperature with a Johnson noise
    thermometer. Principles of hypothesis testing are discussed, with emphasis being
    placed on the importance of utilizing prior knowledge in the design of a powerful
    test. Tests are presented for corruption affecting the time signal and frequency
    spectrum as spikes or as localized deviations. Calculations of the statistical
    power of the tests are described, and example values given. The statistical power
    is sufficient for corruption at practical levels of interest to be detected with
    high probability.</p>"
