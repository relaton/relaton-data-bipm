abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "<p>This paper reports the third set of results of a series of grouped
    laser comparisons from national laboratories undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the request of the Comite Consultatif pour la Definition
    du Metre (CCDM) for the period July 1993 to September 1995. The results of this
    comparison, involving eight lasers, are comparable with those obtained during
    a first comparison in 1988 involving most of the same national laboratories. The
    lasers were first compared with the BIPM lasers with the parameters set to the
    values normally used in each laboratory, the results then ranged from -23 kHz
    to +28.2 kHz. After checking and readjusting the values of all the parameters,
    the range was reduced to -20.4 kHz to +9.7 kHz. Under the latter conditions, the
    average frequency difference of the group of lasers, with respect to the BIPM4
    laser, was -5.8 kHz with a standard uncertainty of 12.3 kHz. Typical frequency
    stabilities with Allan standard deviations of about 1.8 × 10<sup>-11</sup> and
    1.8 × 10<sup>-12</sup> were observed with sampling times of 1 s and 100 s, respectively.</p>"
