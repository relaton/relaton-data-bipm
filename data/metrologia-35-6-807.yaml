  content: "<p>We discuss two different ways in which terms such as percent (%) and
    parts per million (ppm) are used, both in the scientific literature and in everyday
    language. We give examples of the way in which these terms may be used without
    ambiguity, and we also describe common misuse of the terms. We suggest the adoption
    of the special name uno (symbol U) for the unit one, for use with the International
    System of Units (SI) prefixes in place of terms such as percent and parts per
    million in the technical literature.</p>"
