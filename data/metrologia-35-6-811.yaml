  content: <p>The lattice parameter of silicon plays an important role in the determination
    of the Avogadro constant and the fine-structure constant. Today, three values
    of the <italic>d</italic><sub>220</sub> silicon lattice spacing are available,
    measured at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany), the Istituto
    di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" (IMGC, Italy) and the National Research Laboratory
    of Metrology (NRLM, Japan) and based on the metre scale. Using the PTB lattice
    spacing comparator, the spacings of the different materials were measured and
    compared with one another in order to check the possibility of combining the results
    to form a common "best" value. The characterization of the relevant impurities
    and crystal defects and their number densities are discussed and corrections applied
    for their influences on the interatomic distances. The NRLM data are in disagreement
    with those of the PTB and the IMGC, from which a lattice parameter for a hypothetical,
    ideal, perfect Si crystal was derived with a relative uncertainty of about .</p>
