abstract:
- content: "<p>We have developed a finite-element-analysis thermal model to study
    the temperature distribution in a laser-optimized cryogenic radiometer (LOCR).
    Our modelling showed that the worst-case inequivalence between electrical and
    optical power is 0.0004%. We used the thermal model, empirical testing, and research
    performed at other laboratories, to conduct a detailed uncertainty analysis for
    laser power calibrations based on the LOCR. Using photodiode trap detectors at
    laser wavelengths of 633.0 nm and 1550.4 nm as intermediate standards, we showed
    that the cryogenic radiometer and the NIST C4 laser calorimeter agree within 0.1%.</p>"
