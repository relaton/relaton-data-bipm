abstract:
- content: "<p>Results of calibrations performed by eleven laboratories during the
    period October 1993 to October 1995, in a comparison of European low differential
    pressure standards, are summarized. The differential pressure range was 3 Pa to
    1000 Pa superimposed upon a line pressure of nominally 100 kPa using a Furness
    Controls FRS4 as the transfer standard.</p>"
