abstract:
- content: "<p>A new definition of the kilogram based on the relations  E  =  mc<sup>2</sup>
    and  E  =  h Î½ is proposed, motivated by recent progress in the development of
    moving-coil watt balances. Such a balance together with the definition promises
    to provide a practical means of directly calibrating standards of mass.</p>"
