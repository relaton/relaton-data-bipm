  content: "<p>The results are presented of an international comparison of the SI
    photometric base unit, the candela, as realized and maintained at the National
    Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK) and the Metrology Research Institute at Helsinki
    University of Technology (HUT, Finland). Both laboratories base their luminous
    intensity units on absolutely calibrated photometers and these, as well as the
    more traditional transfer standard lamps, were used for the comparison. The results
    show that the units established and maintained at the two laboratories agree to
    well within the expanded uncertainty.</p>"
