  content: <p>The half-life of <sup>241</sup>Pu for β decay has been determined on
    an initially 93 % isotopically enriched material by measuring the decreasing amount
    ratio <italic>n</italic>(<sup>241</sup>Pu)/<italic>n</italic>(<sup>240</sup>Pu)
    as a function of time over more than twenty years. Over the same period the decrease
    of this ratio was measured relative to the amount ratio <italic>n</italic>(<sup>240</sup>Pu)/<italic>n</italic>(<sup>239</sup>Pu)
    in a "ratio-of-ratio" measurement which allowed for correction of isotopic effects
    in the ion source, taking into account the decay of <sup>240</sup>Pu (half-life
    = 6553 a) and <sup>239</sup>Pu (half-life = 24110 a). A regression procedure of
    the ratio-of-ratio measurements as a function of time resulted in a value for
    the <sup>241</sup>Pu half-life of (14.290 ± 0.006) a (expanded uncertainty with
    coverage factor <italic>k</italic> = 2). The slight difference found in the half-life
    value as measured by the authors on the same material in the period 1976 to 1981
    is discussed.</p>
