abstract:
- content: <p>The half-life of<sup>241</sup>Pu for β decay has been determined on
    an initially 93 % isotopically enriched material by measuring the decreasing amount
    ratio n(<sup>241</sup>Pu)/n(<sup>240</sup>Pu) as a function of time over more
    than twenty years. Over the same period the decrease of this ratio was measured
    relative to the amount ratio n(<sup>240</sup>Pu)/n(<sup>239</sup>Pu) in a "ratio-of-ratio"
    measurement which allowed for correction of isotopic effects in the ion source,
    taking into account the decay of<sup>240</sup>Pu (half-life = 6553 a) and<sup>239</sup>Pu
    (half-life = 24110 a). A regression procedure of the ratio-of-ratio measurements
    as a function of time resulted in a value for the<sup>241</sup>Pu half-life of
    (14.290 ± 0.006) a (expanded uncertainty with coverage factor k = 2). The slight
    difference found in the half-life value as measured by the authors on the same
    material in the period 1976 to 1981 is discussed.</p>
