  content: "<p>As an integral part of the International Temperature Scale of 1990
    (ITS-90) the interpolating constantvolume gas thermometer (ICVGT) covers the temperature
    range between 3 K and 24.6 K. It requires calibration at only three fixed points
    without the application of explicit gas-thermometric corrections. Before the introduction
    of the ICVGT in 1990, computer simulations were carried out to establish to what
    extent the design parameters influence its behaviour, since the design details
    were to be left to the user. At the time only the major parameters were examined.
    One of the parameters not considered was the influence of thermal anchoring of
    the pressure line, which is the subject of the present paper. Thermal anchoring
    is applied to deviate heat flux to the cryogenic bath. This influence is much
    greater than was estimated during the preparation of the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990. It is therefore strongly suggested, on the basis of the present
    calculations, that for those cases where the diameter of the pressure line exceeds
    1 mm, the temperature for thermal anchoring of the pressure line should be well
    above 25 K to 30 K (or no anchoring should be applied at all) in order that both
    the non-uniqueness between realizations and the interpolation residuals are minimized,
    with 3 K and 5 K as the lower fixed points. Where this is not possible, the negative
    effects of thermal anchoring can be compensated, for any anchoring temperature,
    by reducing the diameter of the pressure line below the anchor point to 1 mm.</p>"
