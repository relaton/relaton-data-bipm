abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on an original design by F. H. Attix, an improved free-air ionization
    chamber was constructed at the National Radiation Standard Laboratory of the Institute
    of Nuclear Energy Research (INER, Taiwan), as the primary standard for x-rays
    generated at energy levels between 50 keV and 300 keV. Various improvements were
    made to the Attix design, including modifications of the chamber structure and
    the measurement technique. The changes include: (i) a three-section design with
    fixed central cylinder; (ii) thickening of the shielding box; (iii) a circuitous
    mechanism for the operational handle, to avoid unwanted scattering; (iv) a ruler
    mechanism to provide fine position control; and (v) increased thickness of the
    aluminium wall of the chamber. After initial experimental verification, a comparison
    with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) using a transfer
    standard chamber yielded differences in calibration factors of less than 1 %.
    In addition, the overall uncertainty for the x-ray measurement in terms of air
    kerma is less than 1 % at the 95 % confidence level. These results indicate that
    the improved free-air ionization chamber can serve as a primary standard at the
    NRSL.</p>"
