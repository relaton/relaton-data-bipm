  content: "<p>An extended-cavity diode laser has been stabilized to hyperfine components
    of the 6-3, P(33) transition of the B-X system of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    at 633 nm, and its performance evaluated by comparison with an iodine-stabilized
    He-Ne laser. The Allan standard deviation follows a slope of 3.8 × 10<sup>-11</sup>
    τ<sup>-1/2</sup>, reaching a minimum of 1.7  × 10<sup>-12</sup> at 500 s, and
    the reproducibility of the diode laser locked to component b<sub>21</sub> has
    been determined to be 7 kHz (standard uncertainty) corresponding to a fractional
    uncertainty of 1.5 × 10<sup>-11</sup>. In addition, the influence of modulation
    depth, iodine pressure and axial power density on laser frequency has been investigated.
    Complete hyperfine interval sets and absolute frequency determinations of component
    b<sub>21</sub> are presented for modulation depths of 2 MHz and 6 MHz.</p>"
