abstract:
- content: "<p>A general method is proposed to evaluate the uncertainty of Josephson
    voltage standard measurements exclusive of the uncertainty contributed by the
    device under test. The method is based on a statistical evaluation of the results
    of measurements of a short circuit under conditions that exactly duplicate the
    procedure used for normal calibrations. It gives a rigorous Type A evaluation
    of many uncertainty components that have typically been considered Type B uncertainties
    and often assigned worst-case values. Uncertainty components for frequency and
    leakage are not detected by short-circuit measurements and are separately evaluated.
    The method is applied to the results of an interlaboratory comparison and used
    to generate a statement of equivalence.</p>"
