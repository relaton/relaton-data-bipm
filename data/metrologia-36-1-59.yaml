  content: "<p>Comparisons of the 1 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures were made with that of the Centro Espanol de
    Metrologia, Madrid (Spain), in October 1997. The results agree within an overall
    standard uncertainty of less than 1 nV.</p>"
