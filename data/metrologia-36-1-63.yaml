  content: "<p>A new definition of the kilogram based on the relations <italic>E</italic>
    = <italic>mc</italic><sup>2</sup> and <italic>E</italic> = <italic>h</italic>Î½
    is proposed, motivated by recent progress in the development of moving-coil watt
    balances. Such a balance together with the definition promises to provide a practical
    means of directly calibrating standards of mass.</p>"
