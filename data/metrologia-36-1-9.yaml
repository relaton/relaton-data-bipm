  content: "<p>A formal approach to constructing unit systems based on the fundamental
    constants is considered. The approach involves units whose sizes can be specified
    through system constants. The structure of the International System of Units (SI),
    is considered from this standpoint. Modifications of the SI are constructed and
    changes of adjusted values of the fundamental constants in the modified systems
    are analysed.</p>"
