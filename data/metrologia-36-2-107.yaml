abstract:
- content: "<p>A model is proposed for the calibration of a standard platinum resistance
    thermometer (SPRT) in accordance with the BIPM recommended procedures to realize
    the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). The model is used to obtain
    the standard uncertainty of measurement associated with the temperature indicated
    by the thermometer. The difference between calibration uncertainty and user's
    uncertainty is established. Equations are illustrated by an example that considers
    the ITS-90 subrange from 273.15 K to 692.677 K. The approach closely follows the
    rules in the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.</p>"
