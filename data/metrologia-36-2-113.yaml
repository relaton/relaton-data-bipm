abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper assumes accurate the method of evaluating the expanded uncertainty
    of measurement results based on convolution of the distributions of known component
    uncertainties. This assumption allows the author to compare the accuracy of selected
    approximate evaluation methods. Only very simple direct measurements are considered,
    where the number of independent component uncertainties is limited and the number
    of results is small.</p>"
