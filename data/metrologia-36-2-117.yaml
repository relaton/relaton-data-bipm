abstract:
- content: <p>The reproducibility of some thermometric fixed points and the accuracy
    of four platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) were studied. It was found that
    the fixed points of aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn), tin (Sn), indium (In) and gallium
    (Ga) were realized reproducibly within ±0.17 mK; ±0.11 mK; ±0.10 mK; ±0.13 mK
    and ±0.12 mK, respectively. Because the actual impurities and their concentration
    in our samples (of 99.9999% or 99.999 99% purity) are unknown, the systematic
    uncertainty due to impurities cannot be estimated. However, any of the samples
    of Ga, In, Sn, Zn and Al is consistent with the rest within ±0.2 mK, using a cubic
    or quadratic deviation function, in the temperature range 0 °C to 660 °C. This
    indicates that the effect of impurities is negligible. Four PRTs were selected
    at random. They were calibrated repeatedly, first up to the Zn point and then
    up to the Al point. The resistance of each PRT drifted. From time to time, for
    each PRT, a seemingly well-established resistance drift suddenly and unpredictably
    changed to a different rate of drift. Occasionally, the resistance of the PRTs
    shifted. Such unpredictable changes obviously limit the accuracy of temperature
    measurements using PRTs no matter what the accuracy of their calibrations. In
    the case of our four PRTs, the uncertainty of temperature measurements near 660
    °C ranged from about ±1 mK to about ±2.5 mK even though they were all calibrated
    at all fixed points well within ±0.25 mK uncertainty. Possible explanations are
    offered for the apparently permanent drifts and the erratic shifts in the resistance
    of the PRTs. Some comments are made concerning the ambiguity of "immersion tests"
    in general. The furnaces of the National Research Council of Canada used in this
    work are high-temperature adiabatic calorimeters.</p>
