  content: "<p>A radiometric source facility is being constructed with narrowband,
    widely tuneable lasers covering the wavelength range ≈ 200 nm to 12 µm. The laser
    beam will pass into an integrating sphere and the output will be large-area, highly
    uniform, and monochromatic. This facility will be used to make a wide variety
    of radiometric measurements, such as radiant power, radiance, irradiance, transmittance
    and reflectance.</p>"
