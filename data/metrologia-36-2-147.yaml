  content: "<p>At the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble
    the fine-structure constant alpha was determined by measuring the quotient of
    the Planck constant and the neutron mass <italic>h</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub>.
    The results have already been published. In order to evaluate the measurement
    data, the lattice parameters of several silicon crystals must be known very accurately.
    As these parameters can now be determined in a more direct way than in the past,
    the results of the experiment have been re-evaluated. The values obtained by the
    re-evaluation are <italic>h</italic>/<italic>m</italic><sub>n</sub> = 3.956 033
    285 (287) × 10<sup>-7</sup>m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> (relative standard uncertainty
    7.26 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and α<sup>-1</sup> = 137.036 011 44 (498) (relative standard
    uncertainty 3.64 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), the uncertainties being one-standard-deviation
    estimates. These values differ from those obtained in the first evaluation by
    only about 15 % of their uncertainties.</p>"
