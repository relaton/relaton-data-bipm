  content: "<p>The uncertainty budget of the BIPM primary standard manobarometer of
    the BIPM-Jaeger type, which has been replicated commercially for use in other
    national metrology laboratories, has been re-assessed. The effect of different
    media on the paths of the two white-light beams sensing the mercury column height
    has been studied using the actual spectrum of the light. The dominating contributions
    to the overall uncertainty have been reduced substantially.</p>"
