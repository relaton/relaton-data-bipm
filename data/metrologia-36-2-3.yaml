abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison (CCQM-3) of the concentration of the compound (pp'-dichlorodiphenyl)
    dichloroethylene (pp'-DDE) in 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane solvent by national laboratories
    using isotope dilution mass spectrometry has been completed. Two levels of sample
    solution were provided within the range 0.05 µg g<sup>-1</sup> to 5 µg g<sup>-1</sup>.
    A discussion on the choice of compound for this comparison is given. The purity
    of the pp-DDE material used was determined using gas chromatography, differential
    scanning calorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography. Details of the
    preparation of the comparison solutions are given, including choice of containers
    and septum seals to prevent solvent evaporation. Full results of the comparison
    are given. Good agreement was obtained between laboratories at both concentration
    levels, with a majority of participants achieving a result within 1% of the reference
    values. There was a lack of consistency in the calculation of the overall uncertainty,
    therefore a typical example of a measurement uncertainty estimation for this comparison
    is given. Brief details of calibration procedures in IDMS are also given.</p>"
