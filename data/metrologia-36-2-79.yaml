  content: "<p>Techniques are recommended for comparisons, at the highest levels of
    accuracy, of fixed-point cells of the defining fixed points, excluding the vapour-pressure
    points, of the ITS-90, which are used for contact thermometry. The authors are
    the members of Working Group 1 of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT)
    of the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures, dealing with Defining Fixed
    Points and Interpolating Instruments underlying the realization of the ITS-90.</p>"
