abstract:
- content: "<p>At the high-flux reactor of the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble
    the fine-structure constant alpha was determined by measuring the quotient of
    the Planck constant and the neutron mass h/m<sub>n</sub>. The results have already
    been published. In order to evaluate the measurement data, the lattice parameters
    of several silicon crystals must be known very accurately. As these parameters
    can now be determined in a more direct way than in the past, the results of the
    experiment have been re-evaluated. The values obtained by the re-evaluation are
    h/m<sub>n</sub> = 3.956 033 285 (287) × 10<sup>-7</sup>m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>
    (relative standard uncertainty 7.26 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and α<sup>-1</sup> = 137.036
    011 44 (498) (relative standard uncertainty 3.64 × 10<sup>-8</sup>), the uncertainties
    being one-standard-deviation estimates. These values differ from those obtained
    in the first evaluation by only about 15 % of their uncertainties.</p>"
