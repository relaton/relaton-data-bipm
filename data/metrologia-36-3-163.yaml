- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Bayesian inference about a quantity is made through the probability
    density function that describes the state of incomplete knowledge acquired from
    measurement. This approach can be applied advantageously to evaluate the data
    obtained from repeated measurements of a quantity, with or without added information
    on the variances or error bounds of the indicated values. Results are compared
    with those obtained using conventional statistical theory. It is concluded that
    Bayesian inference allows a flexible and natural characterization of the measurement
    uncertainty.</p>"
