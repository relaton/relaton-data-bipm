abstract:
- content: "<p>At the D. I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM) a high-precision
    system using helium-4 atomic magnetic resonance has been realized for the automatic
    reproduction and maintenance of direct current in the range 0.1 A to 1.0 A. A
    random standard uncertainty of 2 × 10<sup>-8</sup> was obtained for stabilization
    at 1 A, with a non-linearity of less than 2 × 10<sup>-7</sup> in the frequency-to-current
    conversion factor. The conversion factor was determined experimentally through
    the gyromagnetic ratio of helium-4 atoms and the calculable coil constant of a
    high-precision solenoid. The technique was used to determine the gyromagnetic
    ratio of the proton and for the accurate reproduction of the tesla using the calculable
    solenoid.</p>"
