  content: "<p>We present a new method for the calibration of inhomogeneous irradiance
    or illuminance meters. Using this method, a lux meter equipped with a mosaic filter
    was calibrated with an estimated uncertainty of 0.15 % (1 Ïƒ). A preliminary illuminance
    comparison has been performed between the new scale and a lamp-based scale maintained
    at the Nederlands Meetinstituut Van Swinden Laboratorium (NMi VSL). The observed
    difference is equal to the uncertainty of this comparison, 0.4 %.</p>"
