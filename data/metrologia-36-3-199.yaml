abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports the fourth set of results of a series of grouped
    laser comparisons from national laboratories undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the request of the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition
    du Mètre (CCDM; now the Consultative Committee for Length, CCL) during the period
    July 1993 to September 1995. The results of this comparison, involving eleven
    lasers from eight countries and the BIPM, again meet the goals set by the CCDM
    in 1992 and adopted by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) the
    same year. The standard uncertainty of the frequency of the He-Ne laser stabilized
    on the saturated absorption of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at λ ≈ 633 nm is reduced
    to a level of 12 kHz (2.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) when the lasers compared meet
    the recommended values of the parameters. The lasers were first compared with
    the BIPM4 laser with the parameters set to the values normally used in each laboratory;
    using the BIPM4 laser as a reference the results ranged from-15.4 kHz to 36.8
    kHz. After checking and readjusting the values of all the parameters, the range
    was reduced to-8.6 kHz to 14.0 kHz. Under the latter conditions, the average frequency
    difference of the group of lasers, with respect to the BIPM4 laser, was 2.7 kHz
    with a standard uncertainty (1 σ) of 8.1 kHz. The best relative frequency stabilities,
    with Allan standard deviations of about 5.5 parts in 10<sup>12</sup> and 4.6 parts
    in 10<sup>13</sup>, were observed with sampling times of 1 s and 100 s, respectively.</p>"
