  content: "<p>Melting and freezing plateaus were radiometrically observed for the
    metal-carbon eutectics Ni-C, Pd-C, Pt-C, and Ru-C, using graphite crucibles and
    black-body cavities. The graphite crucibles were able to withstand heat cycles
    without breaking. Since the crucible material is a component of the eutectic fixed-point
    material, the latter is inherently free of contamination from the crucible. The
    temperature differences between the melting and freezing plateaus were generally
    less than 0.1 °C. The method seems to be a promising way of realizing a series
    of practical reference points above the copper point.</p>"
