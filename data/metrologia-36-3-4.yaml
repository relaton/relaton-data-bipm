abstract:
- content: "<p>Thermal accommodation of 1 kg and 50 kg weights to ambient air under
    different storing conditions and change of apparent mass due to temperature differences
    between weight and air have been measured. Physical models taking account of different
    heat transfer processes and of convective forces of flowing air acting on the
    weight have been developed for describing the measurement results. Finally, the
    models are used to extrapolate the results and predict the change of apparent
    mass and waiting times for given residual deviations of apparent mass and residual
    temperature differences for weights of similar shape but other nominal values.</p>"
