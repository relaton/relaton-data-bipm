abstract:
- content: "<p>The development of a new electrodynamic shaker permits the calibration
    of accelerometers by two independent and absolute methods using the same shaker.
    Minimizing the uncertainty in the calibration of accelerometers by the reciprocity
    method requires minimization of the cross-axis component of the induced motion,
    and the distortion of its waveform. Minimizing the uncertainty in the calibration
    of accelerometers by the laser interferometric fringe-counting method requires
    minimization of the mechanical coupling between the moving element of the shaker
    and the optical components of the interferometer. The design of the new shaker
    provides for minimal distortion and cross-axis motion in combination with a very
    large mechanical impedance between the moving element of the shaker and the optical
    components of the interferometer. The shaker is equipped with dual coils and two
    retractable magnets to provide for reciprocity measurements without having to
    attach a secondary source of vibration located external to the moving element.
    This paper presents a comparison of calibration results obtained using the two
    methods and describes the shaker and calibration systems.</p>"
