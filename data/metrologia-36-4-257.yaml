  content: "<p>Historically, various techniques have been used in acoustics to attempt
    to establish and measure sound pressures (spatially uniform amplitude of sound
    pressure, as in a suitable coupling cavity that is small compared with a wavelength
    of sound) and in the free field (plane progressive sound wave at a specified angle
    of incidence, in the absence of reflecting surfaces). At present, over a broad
    range of frequencies the most accurate, precise, and convenient methods involve
    the primary calibrations of laboratory standard microphones by reciprocity techniques.
    Some issues and parameters in these techniques that must be considered in comparisons,
    and selected previous interlaboratory comparisons themselves, are discussed. Recommendations
    relevant to a key comparison already identified, as well as future work areas,
    are presented.</p>"
