abstract:
- content: "<p>The sensitivity of condenser measurement microphones depends on the
    environmental conditions, which affect the acoustic properties of the air enclosed
    between the diaphragm and the back electrode and in the cavity behind the back
    electrode. A theoretical investigation has been performed based on an extended
    lumped parameter representation of the mechanical and acoustic elements of the
    microphone. The extension involves the frequency dependency of the dynamic diaphragm
    mass and stiffness as well as a first-order approximation of resonances in the
    back cavity. It was found that each coefficient, for a given type of microphone,
    can be described by a single function when the coefficients are normalized using
    their low-frequency value and the frequency is normalized with respect to the
    individual resonance frequency of the microphone. The theoretical results are
    supported by experimentally determined coefficients for about twenty samples of
    microphone types B&amp;K 4160 and B&amp;K 4180.</p>"
