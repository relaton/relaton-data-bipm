  content: "<p>The operation of an environmental chamber for high-precision calibration
    of laboratory standard microphones and acoustical measurements is described. The
    nominal ranges for the environmental control system are: temperature from -10
    °C to 50 °C; pressure from 80 kPa to 110 kPa; and relative humidity (RH) from
    10 % to 90 %. The estimated uncertainties (expanded, with 95 % confidence level)
    of the pressure, temperature and humidity measurements were 20 Pa, 0.05 °C and
    5 % RH, respectively. The sensitivity pressure correction for Bruel &amp; Kjaer
    type 4160 laboratory standard microphones varies with frequency. Over the barometric
    pressure range 94 kPa to 106 kPa, the sensitivity of B&amp;K 4160 laboratory standard
    microphones changes by approximately 0.2 dB at 1 kHz and 0.35 dB at 10 kHz. An
    empirical equation for this microphone sensitivity pressure correction for the
    B&amp;K 4160 microphone has been developed.</p>"
