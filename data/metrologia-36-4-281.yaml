abstract:
- content: "<p>International comparison calibrations of hydrophone standards often
    involve the use of facilities with different water temperatures. Accurate comparison
    of the sensitivity values obtained in the different facilities then requires correction
    for the temperature dependence of the sensitivity. A hydrophone standard suitable
    for comparison calibrations was calibrated at temperatures from 5 °C to 35 °C
    in 5 °C steps. The calibrations were performed over the frequency range 5 kHz
    to 100 kHz in the Acoustic Pressure Tank Facility at the Underwater Sound Reference
    Division. The measured temperature dependence is much more complex than expected.
    Results are presented together with a discussion of possible contributions to
    this complexity.</p>"
