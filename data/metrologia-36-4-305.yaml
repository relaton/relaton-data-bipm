  content: "<p>A new, closed-chamber, reciprocity technique for determining the free-field
    voltage sensitivity of hydrophones to a very high accuracy has been described
    in a previous publication by the author. The subject of the current paper is a
    detailed uncertainty analysis for a proposed system based on this new technique.
    This system, which is under development, will have an overall uncertainty of 0.1
    dB in the measurement of the free-field voltage sensitivity of hydrophones. All
    significant uncertainties are analysed and a realistic choice of individual uncertainties
    is made to achieve the target uncertainty. Design implications as a result of
    the uncertainty choices are indicated.</p>"
