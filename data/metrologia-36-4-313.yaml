abstract:
- content: "<p>The time-average ultrasonic power emitted by an ultrasonic transducer
    is one of the key values characterizing the strength of ultrasonic fields as a
    whole. For medical applications in particular, measurements are usually carried
    out in water and in the frequency range 1 MHz to 10 MHz. The use of a radiation
    force balance is recommended in International Electrotechnical Commission Standard
    IEC 61161. This measurement method and its practical realization at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt are described. Uncertainties involved in the primary measurement
    and in the dissemination process are discussed.</p>"
