  content: "<p>Four half-wave resonant, air-backed, x-cut quartz disc transducers
    designed and fabricated at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) were circulated
    among seven laboratories between February 1978 and June 1980. Participants were
    given detailed instructions, including values and tolerances for the amplitude
    and frequency of the sinusoidal voltages to be applied to each transducer. Five
    distinct methods were used to measure the total continuous-wave beam power radiated
    by each transducer into a reflectionless water load. Two independent electrical
    techniques were used to directly measure radiation conductance. A detailed tabulation
    of the results was published by the NBS in 1983. Of the 1160 measurements of power
    or radiation conductance constituting the result of this collective effort, 90%
    were made using four techniques based on radiation pressure. In this paper, current
    methods of uncertainty analysis are applied to a representative sample of data
    from radiation-pressure measurements. Old and new analyses are compared to assess
    the sensitivity of results to the choice of computational methods. Newly computed
    combined standard uncertainties are smaller than the original uncertainties for
    more than 60% of the data considered. For the remaining data, the newly computed
    uncertainties are considerably larger than the original values; sufficiently large
    to make the average effect an increase of more than 15%.</p>"
