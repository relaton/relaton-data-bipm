abstract:
- content: "<p>A summary is given of the results of a European comparison of ultrasonic
    power measurements. Three national metrology institutes participated. All measurements
    were carried out using the radiation force balance method according to International
    Electrotechnical Commission Standard IEC 61161, with minor differences in certain
    experimental details. Five standard transducers were circulated, with nominal
    resonance frequencies between 1 MHz and 10 MHz. The measurements covered the power
    range from 10 mW to 200 mW, which roughly corresponds to the output of medical
    diagnostic equipment. The results obtained by the participants agreed within the
    estimated uncertainties.</p>"
