abstract:
- content: "<p>A laser interferometer designed to measure acoustic displacements at
    megahertz frequencies, which has been the basis of a primary standard for the
    calibration of ultrasonic hydrophones for over ten years, is described. The interferometer
    is of the Michelson type and is designed to measure the acoustic particle displacement
    by sensing the movement of a thin plastic membrane placed in the field of an ultrasonic
    transducer. The acoustic pressure is derived from the measurement of displacement
    and the hydrophone is calibrated by substituting it for the pellicle. Various
    sources of uncertainty are described, including acoustooptic corrections, the
    frequency response of the interferometer, the acoustic properties of the thin
    membrane, and the lack of ideal plane-wave conditions. Highest calibration accuracy
    is achievable for membrane hydrophones, with a relative standard uncertainty,
    for a confidence level of 95%, of 0.040 at 0.5 MHz, 0.035 from 1 MHz to 7 MHz,
    0.046 at 20 MHz and increasing to 0.250 at 60 MHz. The dissemination of the primary
    standard calibration method, which uses membrane hydrophones as secondary standards,
    is also described. These hydrophones are shown to have predictable performance
    properties and long-term stability, making them ideal secondary standards and
    choice as gold-standard reference devices worldwide.</p>"
