abstract:
- content: "<p>A European comparison of 1 mm hydrophone calibrations in the frequency
    range 0.5 MHz to 15 MHz is summarized. The project, organized by the Bureau Communautaire
    de Reference (BCR) of the Commission of the European Communities, involved five
    participants from different countries measuring the free-field sensitivity of
    three types of miniature ultrasonic hydrophone. Three different absolute calibration
    methods were used in the project, which was completed and published in 1991. The
    uncertainties quoted at the 95% confidence level ranged from 2.3% to 18%, depending
    on the frequency, method and laboratory. Agreement between laboratories was generally
    within a few parts in 10<sup>2</sup> in the range 0.5 MHz to 5 MHz but individual
    results differed by up to 15% from the grand mean at 10 MHz and 15 MHz.</p>"
