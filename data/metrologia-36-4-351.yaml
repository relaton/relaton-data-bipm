  content: "<p>In a specially designed radiation force balance (RFB), low-frequency
    pulse modulation of the incident ultrasound allows high-accuracy measurement of
    time-averaged spatially-integrated ultrasound power radiated into a reflectionless
    water load. Errors characteristic of force sensors are precluded by operating
    the RFB as a force comparator, without directly measuring force. Equipped with
    purpose-built transducers and electronics, the RFB is adjusted to equate the radiation
    force and a counterforce generated by an actuator calibrated against reference
    masses using direct current as the transfer variable. Special techniques enable
    RFB measurements of the output of continuous-wave and pulsed diagnostic medical
    systems. Nearly twenty years ago, customer feedback indicated that the accuracy
    of power levels replicated using radiation conductance was seriously compromised
    by limitations of equipment typically available. Accordingly, an alternative scheme,
    based on a stable radio frequency (rf) voltage sensor treated as part of the transfer
    standard, was developed which allows ultrasound power-transfer measurements to
    be achieved with relative standard uncertainty components as low as 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup>
    (1 σ), using equipment already available to most customers. A detailed description
    is given of the dc-level method (DCLM), which since 1985 has been, by a wide margin,
    the method most frequently requested.</p>"
