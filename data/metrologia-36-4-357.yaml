  content: "<p>Recent and current activities at the level of national metrology institutes
    (NMIs) towards ensuring traceability of vibration and shock measurements to the
    International System of Units are mainly twofold: (i) initiating and contributing
    to new international standardization projects, within the International Organization
    for Standardization, ISO TC 108, to specify upgraded or new standard methods for
    the vibration and shock calibration of transducers; and (ii) improving the metrological
    base by developing upgraded or new standard equipment (e.g. national measurement
    standards) in compliance with up-to-date standard methods. Laser interferometry,
    which is the preferred primary vibration calibration method at NMI level, has
    been further developed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in recent
    years as a uniform methodology and technique for the primary measurement of translational
    motion quantities (e.g. acceleration) and rotational motion quantities (e.g. angular
    acceleration) at sinusoidal, shock-shaped and other, user-defined time histories.
    A traceability chain has been defined and developed which realizes and disseminates
    the units of the respective physical quantities at such time-dependencies which
    reproduce as closely as possible, during calibration of any transducer (e.g. accelerometer)
    or measuring instrument (e.g. laser vibrometer), the conditions of use after calibration
    (i.e. shock measurement in the peak acceleration range 1000 m/s<sup>2</sup> to
    50000 m/s<sup>2</sup>). A general account is given of the state of the art in
    transducer calibration, and an ensemble is presented of six national measurement
    standards (example from the PTB) with comparison results verifying the lowest
    measurement uncertainty achieved so far. From a survey of past comparisons, conclusions
    are drawn for key comparisons in the field of vibration and shock. Recommendations
    for future work areas are made.</p>"
