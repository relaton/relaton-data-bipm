abstract:
- content: "<p>A primary calibration system for vibration transducers within the mid-
    to high-frequency range (20 Hz to 5 kHz) has been introduced at the National Research
    Laboratory of Metrology, Japan. We used a recently updated method described in
    the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) report FDIS 16063-11,
    called the sine-approximation method. The calibration system is also available
    for conventional methods such as fringe counting and minimum point, as described
    in International Standard ISO 5347-1. Each method is carried out simultaneously
    and the results are compared. Signal-processing procedures and the techniques
    used in the sine-approximation method (phase-unwrapping algorithm, uncertainty
    calculation and resolution of the A/D converter), are discussed. Relative deviations
    within 2 Ã— 10<sup>-3</sup> for frequencies of 160 Hz and 800 Hz in the sine-approximation
    and conventional methods are obtained in the calibration. Problems with the system
    are also discussed.</p>"
