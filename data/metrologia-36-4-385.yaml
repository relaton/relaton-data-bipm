  content: <p>First-level ("primary",or "absolute") accelerometer calibrations are
    those performed at national metrology institutes (NMIs) for the calibration of
    reference accelerometers. The methods commonly used in such calibrations are briefly
    described. Some international comparisons of first-level calibrations are discussed.
    Common sources of error are examined, and illustrated with the results of a recent
    comparison which involved six NMIs from the Asia-Pacific region and one European
    NMI. Also discussed is the excellent agreement, for the range 30 Hz to 10 kHz,
    between several of the NMIs in the comparison, and the clear evidence of systematic
    errors in some of the results.</p>
