  content: "<p>In industrial practice, the decision to accept or reject an inspected
    item is usually made on the basis of measurement information. Since this information
    is rarely complete, it is not possible in general to be absolutely certain about
    the value of the measurand. As a consequence, incorrect decisions may be made.
    In this paper, formulae for the probabilities of improperly accepting or rejecting
    an item are derived. Bayesian statistics provides the theoretical framework, and
    use is made of the Principle of Maximum Entropy. Applications to the inspection
    of workpieces and to the verification of measuring instruments are considered
    and examples are given. The conventional, frequency-based approach is also discussed.</p>"
