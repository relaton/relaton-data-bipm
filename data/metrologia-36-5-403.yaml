abstract:
- content: "<p>A method based on light scattering has been used to characterize the
    surface roughness of four standard kilograms made from XSH alacrite, in order
    to determine the root-mean-square height delta and the correlation length sigma.
    The values of these two parameters, which have been found to lie between 2 nm
    and 5 nm and between 170 nm and 250 nm, respectively, show the high surface quality
    that it is possible to obtain by mechanical polishing of XSH alacrite. Cartographies
    made by light scattering, as well as delta and σ values, have shown that in spite
    of identical manufacturing conditions the kilograms present a significant difference
    in surface roughness. We have observed that the lower bases were in general rougher
    than the upper ones. This was explained by the different histories of the upper
    and lower bases. On the other hand, the same value of σ was found for both bases
    of a given kilogram. We have also found that the smoother the kilogram, the smaller
    the mass loss. This clearly shows the effect of surface roughness on the stability
    of mass standards. Finally, significant variations in the values of and delta
    and σ have been observed after the cleaning-washing process at the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures. We have also shown that the variations noted after several
    successive cleaning-washings are mainly the result of the first of these. This
    agrees with observations made during earlier gravimetric studies.</p>"
