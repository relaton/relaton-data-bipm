  content: "<p>A model is proposed to evaluate the uncertainty of measurement in the
    calibration of thermocouples. The model applies to thermocouple types standardized
    in accordance with electromotive force-temperature reference functions. The difference
    between the calibration uncertainty and the user's uncertainty is established.
    Equations are illustrated through an example involving a type S thermocouple calibrated
    at four fixed points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).
    The example demonstrates the strong dependence of the calibration uncertainty
    on the selected form of the deviation function.</p>"
