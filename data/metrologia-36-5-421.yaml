  content: "<p>A varied assortment of forty-seven new and used steel, ceramic, chromium
    carbide and tungsten carbide gauge blocks from nine manufacturers, ranging in
    length from 0.5 mm to 101.6 mm, were calibrated by four laboratories from the
    NORAMET countries using the method of optical interferometry. Measurements of
    central length of the gauge blocks are compared. The data are utilized as a test
    bed to illustrate the outcome of two different techniques with potential for application
    in comparisons of the calibration services of national metrology institutes (NMIs).</p>"
