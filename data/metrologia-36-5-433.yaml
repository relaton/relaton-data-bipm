abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of He-Ne/I<sub>2</sub> lasers at λ = 633
    nm between the CMI (Czech Republic), the OMH (Hungary) and the BEV (Austria) was
    performed at the CMI-LPM, Prague, in July 1997 as DUNAMET project D3. The frequencies
    of three national standards of length (lasers) were found to be in the range 7
    kHz (1.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) and reproducibility of frequency differences
    between individual lasers during one week was better than 5 kHz (1 part in 10<sup>11</sup>).
    The relative frequency stability, expressed as an Allan standard deviation, reached
    a minimum of 3 parts in 10<sup>13</sup> for an integration time of 10000 s.</p>"
