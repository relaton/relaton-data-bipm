  content: '<p>An artefact standard may be used in a comparison between two laboratories
    to measure the difference between their respective realizations of a physical
    unit. In the usual three-stage sequence, one laboratory, the "pilot" laboratory,
    measures the artefact before and after its measurement at the second laboratory.
    Three procedures are described for analysing the results of such a comparison:
    "deviation from fit to pilot" (DFP), "overall constant drift" (OCD, which yields
    similar results to DFP for any difference in the laboratories'' realizations but
    which is statistically more rigorous and also gives quite different estimates
    of uncertainties), and "separately fitted lines" (SFL). If OCD is used, the uncertainty
    of the comparison is minimized if the measurements at the two laboratories have
    the same mean epoch. If SFL is used, the uncertainty is minimized if the intervals
    between successive epochs at the second laboratory are invariant under time-reversal.
    SFL allows transportation effects to be estimated as Type A uncertainties, separately
    from residual scatter, and can signal their presence through a sharp reduction
    in degrees of freedom. Computer simulations of comparisons indicate that SFL is
    at least as accurate as DFP and OCD, and is often more accurate. Two case studies
    of Zener-based voltage standard artefacts are given.</p>'
