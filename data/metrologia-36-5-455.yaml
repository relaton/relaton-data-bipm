abstract:
- content: "<p> In order to determine the Avogadro constant by the x-ray crystal density
    method, the molar volume of silicon in a single crystal grown by the float-zone
    method was determined by absolute measurements of the density and the molar mass
    of the crystal. The density was directly determined by mass and volume measurements
    of 1 kg spheres fabricated from the crystal. For the volume determination, a scanning-type
    optical interferometer was developed to measure the diameters of the spheres.
    The molar mass measurements were calibrated using synthetic isotope mixtures prepared
    from enriched silicon isotopes. Two spheres for density measurements, and fourteen
    samples for molar mass measurements, were systematically prepared from the crystal
    to evaluate distributions of the density and the isotopic composition of the crystal.
    The results give a molar volume of 12.0588646 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol with a standard
    uncertainty of 0.0000026 cm<sup>3</sup>/mol, at 22.500 °C and 0 Pa after correction
    for impurities. When this value is combined with the lattice constant of the crystal
    determined using a combined x-ray/optical interferometer, a value of 6.0221550
    × 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> with a standard uncertainty of 0.0000016 ×
    10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> is obtained for the Avogadro constant.</p>"
