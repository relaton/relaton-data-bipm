  content: "<p>A vertical alumina palladium (Pd) freezing-point cell was made and
    used for the calibration of noble metal thermocouples. Various characteristics
    of the freezing process were investigated using type B thermocouples, and the
    best method of freezing is discussed. It was found that the freezing behaviour
    was influenced by the thermal history: it is preferable to freeze the Pd melt
    completely before carrying out the next test. The thermocouple emfs during freezing
    were determined by calculating the average emf during the first 10 minutes of
    the plateau just after the depression in the supercooling curve. This emf was
    reproducible within a standard deviation of 0.1 °C. The expanded uncertainty of
    calibrating a type B thermocouple in the Pd freezing-point cell was estimated
    to be 1.0 °C at the 95% confidence level (<italic>k</italic> = 2).</p>"
