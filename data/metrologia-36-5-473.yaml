abstract:
- content: "<p>An analysis was undertaken of the dynamic parameters of standard cells
    in a circuit for the direct measurement of a standard cell with a Josephson junction
    array voltage standard. The parameters of the models of a null detector and a
    standard cell were determined experimentally. It is shown that, according to these
    parameters, a standard cell can be measured directly with a voltage standard,
    with an uncertainty at the nanovolt level.</p>"
