abstract:
- content: "<p>Tristimulus response functions are either calculated from spectral-irradiance
    data or measured directly and used to calculate parameters representing colour.
    The tristimulus responses are correlated because they depend on the same spectral
    information. In this paper we derive and confirm the correlation coefficients
    between the tristimulus response functions. These coefficients are important in
    the estimation of uncertainty for colour coordinates.</p>"
