abstract:
- content: <p>Different methods, based both on analytical considerations and on the
    Monte Carlo evaluation, were applied to the calculation of the correction factor,
    K, of the conductance of the orifice of the new Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti"
    (CNR-IMGC) dynamic system. The results are compared and the uncertainty with which
    K is determined is discussed. The data from the McCulloh method and from Monte
    Carlo simulations are compared. The latter method, while taking into account the
    conductance of all the geometrical parts, offers the possibility of evaluating
    the uncertainty without any approximation.</p>
