abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1992, the Bureau National de Metrologie-Laboratoire National
    d'Essais (BNM-LNE) has been working on the calibration of differential pressure
    transducers using gas-operated twin balances. Improvements in the pressure balances
    themselves, in environmental conditions and in measurement methods have optimized
    the calibration of capacitance diaphragm gauges (CDGs). A number of instruments
    have been compared in both differential and absolute modes to establish the pressure
    scale between 0.1 Pa and 10 kPa. The pressure range 0.1 mPa to 10 Pa was covered
    by spinning rotor gauges (SRGs) calibrated by comparison with the CDGs over the
    three higher decades. The linearity of the SRGs was checked by the dynamic-expansion
    method. Both CDGs and SRGs demonstrated a high level of repeatability. Stability
    over time can vary greatly between instruments, but is predictable under laboratory
    conditions. The input pressure is also predictable from the output signal. The
    paper describes calibration methods, performance and estimation of uncertainty
    in order to establish an effective calibration chain for both differential and
    absolute pressure measurements.</p>"
