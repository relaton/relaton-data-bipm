abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of a wide-ranging key comparison organized by the Consultative
    Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) of the Comit√© International des
    Poids et Mesures, this report gives the results of a comparison of pressure measurements
    in the range 0.05 MPa to 1 MPa. The two transfer standards used were pressure
    balances equipped with large (10 cm<sup>2</sup>) effective area piston-cylinder
    assemblies. The scope of the comparison covered the observation of the behaviour
    of both piston and cylinder assemblies from two manufacturers and made from different
    materials. The results show agreement of all the laboratory standards within the
    estimated expanded uncertainties, expressed with a coverage factor k = 2. Most
    of the difference values (47 out of 54) are inside the standard uncertainties.
    These results demonstrate the coherency of the standards of the participating
    laboratories in the range 100 kPa to 1000 kPa for gas pressure, gauge mode.</p>"
