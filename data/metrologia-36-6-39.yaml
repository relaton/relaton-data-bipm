abstract:
- content: "<p>We discuss methods for analysing calibration data to estimate the effective
    area of a pressure balance. These include the so-called P- and Î”P-methods, and
    a method in which the estimate is made by solving a generalized regression problem
    that reflects more correctly the error structure in the measurement data. We compare
    these methods, both from a theoretical point of view and on simulated data, and
    show that the differences in the parameter estimates can be significant compared
    with the claimed measurement uncertainty.</p>"
