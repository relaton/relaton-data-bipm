  content: "<p>A new primary standard for the realization of vacuum pressures between
    10<sup>-10</sup> Pa and 3 × 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa has been completed at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB). It is based on the continuous expansion method, whereby the
    range is extended to lower pressures by the use of a flow divider. In this flow
    divider, the gas flow from the fully automated flowmeter with throughputs ranging
    from 10<sup>-6</sup> Pa l/s up to 3 Pa l/s (at 23 degrees C) is directed via two
    differently sized orifices into two chambers: the XHV calibration chamber, which
    is designed for calibration pressures 10<sup>-10</sup> Pa to 10<sup>-4</sup> Pa,
    takes up 1% of the flow, while the UHV calibration chamber, which is designed
    for pressures 10<sup>-8</sup> Pa to 3 × 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa, takes up 99% of the
    flow. Both calibration chambers are operated with cryopumps during calibration.
    The relative standard uncertainties of pressures generated by this new standard
    range from 7 × 10<sup>-3</sup> at 10<sup>-10</sup> Pa, when a perfectly stable
    residual pressure is assumed, to 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> at 10<sup>-4</sup> Pa.</p>"
