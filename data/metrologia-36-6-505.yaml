  content: <p>A compact version, designated MM1, of the HG5 primary standard manometer
    of the Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" (IMGC) is described. The instrument
    was constructed in order to exploit thoroughly, in the range of pressures up to
    5 kPa, the potential accuracy of the measurement principle and instrumentation
    already adopted in HG5 - the same optical components, instrument hardware and
    software can be used on either of the manometers. The improvement in measurement
    accuracy of the MM1 instrument over that of HG5 in the same range was largely
    obtained by reducing by an order of magnitude the lengths of both mercury and
    gas columns. This provision can reduce the uncertainties associated with the computation
    of aerostatic heads in the U-tube and with the correction of interferometer readings
    for gas refractivity, as well as reduce the detrimental effects of residual temperature
    gradients inside the manometer body. In addition, the systematic adoption of purpose-built
    cat's-eye optical devices allows the reflection of laser beams to be made directly
    on mercury menisci, whereas the massive, all-metal body construction of the manometer
    ensures an improved mechanical stability. The paper includes the uncertainty budget,
    with evaluated standard uncertainties ranging between 12 mPa at 1 Pa and 53 mPa
    at 5 kPa, in the relative or gauge measurement mode.</p>
