abstract:
- content: "<p>The justification, design parameters and status of a new 8.6 m prototype
    fluid column designed to operate up to 5.8 MPa in five 1.2 MPa steps are described,
    with an analysis of the expected and potential uncertainties. The development
    of taller, higher pressure columns is discussed. A proposed new technique is described
    for the precise measurement of vertical height that does not require line-of-sight
    measurement. In this technique, the length scale is set up alongside the pressure
    scale using a low-pressure mercury and water column acting as a multiplier, and
    then transferred by differences to the pressure column. The accurate determinations
    of the compressibility and density of mercury to high pressures are shown to be
    the critical fundamental parameters required to exploit fully the potential of
    very tall, high-pressure fluid columns.</p>"
