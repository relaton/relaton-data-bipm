  content: "<p>Two methods are presented for using conventional pressure balances
    in the pressure range 10 Pa to 10 kPa. Both these methods overcome the inability
    of a pressure balance to generate directly pressures below a limit determined
    by the mass of the floating element. The first method uses twin pressure balances,
    with the desired low pressure established above one pressure balance in terms
    of a small added mass on the other pressure balance. This method is shown to be
    capable of realizing low absolute pressures with a standard uncertainty below
    2 mPa + (9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>)<italic>p</italic>, when operating the pressure balances
    at 100 kPa. The second method uses one pressure balance in conjunction with a
    high-resolution pressure gauge. A calculable low pressure is established above
    the pressure balance either by reference to an added mass on the pressure balance
    or by a change in the pressure gauge reading. A 100 kPa pressure balance is used
    in combination with a commercial high-precision barometric pressure gauge, modified
    to improve the temperature control of its sensor. The standard uncertainty associated
    with this implementation is shown to be about 14 mPa + (9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>)<italic>p</italic>.</p>"
