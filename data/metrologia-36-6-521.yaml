abstract:
- content: "<p>The early history of the development and characterization of a set
    of three 50 mm diameter piston gauges for primary pressure measurements in the
    atmospheric range is described, including target geometric specifications and
    uncertainty objectives, most significantly a relative combined uncertainty in
    pressure of less than 5 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup>. Apart from the relatively large diameter
    of the pistons and the cylinder bores, other noteworthy features of the piston
    gauges include pistons and cylinders made from a ceramic material, a floating
    cylinder design, and the ability to vary the gaps between each piston and cylinder
    combination through application of an independent pressure along a portion of
    the inner surface of the hollow piston. The piston and cylinder elements were
    measured dimensionally by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and
    effective areas and associated uncertainties were calculated. The performance
    of the piston gauges was examined by comparing them, and both mode-of-operation
    and gas-species dependence of the effective areas were investigated and found
    to be within predicted limits. After extensive testing it was concluded that changes
    in the piston-cylinder materials were needed to make the systems easier to use
    consistently and to reduce uncertainty. This early work was quite promising, and
    demonstrated the potential of the approach. The project, with some hardware changes,
    is ongoing.</p>"
