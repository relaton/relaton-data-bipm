  content: "<p>Primary pressure standards in the atmospheric pressure range are often
    established using mercury manometers. To a lesser extent, controlled-clearance
    dead-weight testers, in which one component (normally the piston) has been dimensionally
    measured, have also been used. The recent advances in technology on two fronts:
    (i) the fabrication of large-diameter pistons and cylinders with good geometries;
    and (ii) the dimensional metrology capability of these components, have allowed
    some dead-weight testers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) to achieve total relative uncertainties (2 σ) in generated pressure near
    10 × 10<sup>-6</sup> (10 ppm). This paper describes recent developments at the
    NIST in which accurate dimensional measurements have been translated into effective
    areas. It is anticipated that total relative uncertainties in generated pressure
    may decrease to 5 ppm (2 σ) when recent dimensional measurements are incorporated
    in the newest gauges.</p>"
