abstract:
- content: "<p>Desgranges et Huot, a French company specializing in pressure metrology,
    has been cooperating with the Bureau National de Metrologie-Laboratoire National
    d'Essais (BNM-LNE) for the past five years in the development of the first fully
    automatic absolute pressure balance in the range 10 kPa to 1 MPa, designated APX50.
    The different steps of this project are explained and the technical specifications
    and configuration of the APX50 are presented. A new measuring block has been developed,
    based on a rotating cylinder and receiving large effective area piston-cylinders.
    In addition, a very original mass-loading system has been created allowing the
    automatization of this operation down to the fractional 1 g mass. The new design
    concept of this system allows automatic absolute pressure measurements to be carried
    out with a relative uncertainty down to 5 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup>. The complete metrological
    characteristics of the pressure balance are presented by the BNM-LNE elsewhere
    in this issue. This system, which offers the reliability and specifications of
    high-accuracy pressure balances together with unique features simplifying its
    operation, could potentially replace the mercury columns used as reference standards
    in national metrology institutes worldwide.</p>"
