abstract:
- content: "<p>The main characteristic of the new Bureau National de Metrologie-Laboratoire
    National d'Essais (BNM-LNE) pressure balance for measurements in absolute mode
    is an automatic mechanism for loading the masses on the floating element, allowing
    a stable residual pressure to be maintained during operation. We report the results
    of a study of fall rate for nitrogen and of pressure stability. With several piston-cylinder
    assemblies of 10 cm<sup>2</sup> and 20 cm<sup>2</sup> effective area, cross-floatings
    have been performed in both gauge and absolute mode using a capacitance diaphragm
    gauge (CDG) to measure the difference in pressure delivered by each balance. The
    repeatability of the measurements is less than 0.15 Pa in the range 25 kPa to
    200 kPa in both modes.</p>"
