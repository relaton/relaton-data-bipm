  content: "<p>Three specially designed 5 cm<sup>2</sup> piston-cylinder (p-c) units
    were manufactured by DH Instruments (USA) for use with di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate
    in a special twin pressure balance with a maximum load of 500 kg on each piston.
    The effective areas of all three p-c units could be determined with relative standard
    uncertainties of about 5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> from straightness, roundness and diameter
    measurements using the theory described by Dadson et al. The effective area ratios
    of any two p-c units could be determined from cross-float experiments with relative
    standard uncertainties of about 2 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. They were used to construct
    a consistent set of effective area data. To check the results, all three 5 cm<sup>2</sup>
    p-c units were used to calibrate a 1 cm<sup>2</sup> p-c unit which had been calibrated
    before in the 5 MPa range on the basis of pressure measurements performed by means
    of a high-pressure mercury manometer.</p>"
