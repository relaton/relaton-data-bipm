  content: "<p>A new apparatus is being set up for measuring the density of mercury
    at 20 °C with a relative uncertainty of 0.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> by hydrostatic weighing
    of a sinker of known volume and mass. Two small sinkers of about 50 cm<sup>3</sup>
    were calibrated by hydrostatic comparison with silicon density standards. Thus,
    in the first stage, a relative uncertainty of 2 × 10<sup>-6</sup> of the mercury
    density can be reached. The quantity of mercury needed for the measurements is
    1 l. Also, density comparisons of different mercury samples can be carried out
    with a relative uncertainty of 0.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. To reach a relative uncertainty
    of 0.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> in the density of mercury, a 500 cm<sup>3</sup> hollow
    cube is to be manufactured from tantalum. Its volume will be determined by means
    of an interferometer, with a relative uncertainty of 0.15 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. Measurements
    will be performed for the gravitation experiment of Zurich University using 1
    m<sup>3</sup> of mercury, and for mercury samples used in primary pressure standards.
    Design and results of first tests of the hydrostatic weighing apparatus are reported.</p>"
