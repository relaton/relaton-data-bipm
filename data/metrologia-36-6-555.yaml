abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: <p>Different methods, based both on analytical considerations and on the
    Monte Carlo evaluation, were applied to the calculation of the correction factor,
    <italic>K</italic>, of the conductance of the orifice of the new Istituto di Metrologia
    "G. Colonnetti" (CNR-IMGC) dynamic system. The results are compared and the uncertainty
    with which <italic>K</italic> is determined is discussed. The data from the McCulloh
    method and from Monte Carlo simulations are compared. The latter method, while
    taking into account the conductance of all the geometrical parts, offers the possibility
    of evaluating the uncertainty without any approximation.</p>
