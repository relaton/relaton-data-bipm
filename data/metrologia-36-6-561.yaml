abstract:
- content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, has recently
    constructed a new primary standard of low pressures based on the continuous expansion
    method. This paper is concerned with the properties of the gas flow in one of
    the calibration chambers of this standard. To describe these properties it is
    essential to know, with the smallest possible uncertainty, the conductance of
    the orifice and also the local gas densities at the points where the tested gauges
    are installed. The problem was investigated using the Monte Carlo method. The
    gas flux density on the chamber walls and the correction factors for each gauge
    port were determined (the highest value of the factor was -0.0033 with an expanded
    uncertainty of 0.000 26 (3 σ)). The conductance of the orifice system was also
    examined under free molecular conditions by simulating the movements of over 10<sup>9</sup>
    molecules. The value obtained, referred to the conductance of an ideal orifice
    C<sub>0</sub> was C<sub>eff</sub>/C<sub>0</sub> = 0.997 03 with an expanded uncertainity
    of 0.000 06 (3 σ).</p>"
