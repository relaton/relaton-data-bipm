abstract:
- content: "<p>A model for drag forces in the crevice of pneumatic piston gauges is
    presented. The model uses an interpolation function for momentum transfer between
    the piston and the cylinder mediated by the gas flowing in the crevice. The interpolation
    function bridges the gap between the molecular-flow and viscous-flow regimes,
    and is then used to develop an expression for the effective area of a piston gauge.
    The deviations of the effective area of this model from the viscous-flow results
    are derived for both floating-piston and floating-cylinder designs. Model results
    are compared with published measurements of the effective area of several piston
    gauges in which relative changes as large as 30 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup> (30 ppm) were
    observed when different pressurizing gases were used.</p>"
