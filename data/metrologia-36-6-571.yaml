  content: "<p>The design and analysis of a pressure balance using a finite element
    method is described. The design precisely defines the pressure gradient in the
    gap and provides isolation from end-mounting effects. It also simplifies the finite
    element analysis. The change of area with pressure is calculated for four different
    operating modes, along with the gap profiles and pressure gradients. The sensitivity
    of the change in area with pressure to the piston-cylinder geometry, materials
    and fluid is analysed. The results indicate that the simple mode of operation
    (no external jacket pressure) is preferred as it produces a small uncertainty
    in the change of area with pressure and is easy to implement.</p>"
