  content: <p>Piston-cylinder pressure balances are widely used as pressure standards.
    Under pressure the clearance between the piston and cylinder increases by an amount
    that varies along the piston-cylinder engagement length. Recently, finite element
    techniques have been specifically tailored to model this piston-cylinder distortion
    and the related pressure gradients and flow in the operating fluid. While the
    finite element techniques allow comparison of the effects of piston-cylinder design
    modifications, they still need to be "calibrated" with empirical data. In this
    study a number of novel ways are considered in which the distortion (or lateral
    displacement) of piston-cylinders might be measured as they are pressurized. For
    such data to be of value in refining and confirming the validity of finite element
    models, an uncertainty of about 4 nm (<italic>k</italic> = 2) is required in the
    physical measurement of the piston-cylinder distortion. Techniques considered
    range from discrete sensing of changes in the piston-cylinder gap, such as embedded
    capacitive, inductive or fibre-guided interferometric probes, to full-field sensing
    such as optical interferometry, X-ray or optical thin-film measurements and frustrated
    total internal reflection.</p>
