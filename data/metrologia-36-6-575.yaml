abstract:
- content: <p>Piston-cylinder pressure balances are widely used as pressure standards.
    Under pressure the clearance between the piston and cylinder increases by an amount
    that varies along the piston-cylinder engagement length. Recently, finite element
    techniques have been specifically tailored to model this piston-cylinder distortion
    and the related pressure gradients and flow in the operating fluid. While the
    finite element techniques allow comparison of the effects of piston-cylinder design
    modifications, they still need to be "calibrated" with empirical data. In this
    study a number of novel ways are considered in which the distortion (or lateral
    displacement) of piston-cylinders might be measured as they are pressurized. For
    such data to be of value in refining and confirming the validity of finite element
    models, an uncertainty of about 4 nm (k = 2) is required in the physical measurement
    of the piston-cylinder distortion. Techniques considered range from discrete sensing
    of changes in the piston-cylinder gap, such as embedded capacitive, inductive
    or fibre-guided interferometric probes, to full-field sensing such as optical
    interferometry, X-ray or optical thin-film measurements and frustrated total internal
    reflection.</p>
