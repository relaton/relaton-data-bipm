  content: <p>A finite element method (FEM) developed by the University of Cassino
    and the Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" (IMGC, Turin) to optimize the design
    and use of simple pressure balances was applied while the most important operating
    and design parameters of the piston-cylinder units were varied. In particular,
    the influence of size, geometrical uncertainties and superficial roughness on
    the pressure distortion coefficient and on the piston fall rate was considered.
    Finally an analysis was carried out using the real clearance profile of the IMGC-100-NNtc
    unit based on dimensional measurements made at the IMGC. The comparison between
    the experimental values obtained at the IMGC and the numerical values, of both
    the pressure distortion coefficient and the piston fall rate, show excellent agreement.</p>
