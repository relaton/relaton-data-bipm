abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The main scientific reasons for this study arise from the need for
    primary standards for pressure measurements in liquids in the 1 GPa to 2.6 GPa
    range with a relative uncertainty of at least 10<sup>-3</sup>. An analysis of
    current primary standards for high-pressure measurements shows that few pressure
    balances are operative and routinely used for measurements and calibrations above
    1.4 GPa. In this paper the preliminary studies and calculations for the construction
    of such a system, based on a mixed piston-cylinder unit to be used up to 2.6 GPa,
    are presented. The authors aim at optimization of dimension parameters with particular
    attention to both simple and re-entrant clearance dimensions, and give calculations
    of other important parameters such as piston fall rate versus pressure.</p>"
