abstract:
- content: "<p>The phenomenon known as the spectral photoelastic effect (SPE) is discussed
    and explained. A remote optical pressure sensor has been constructed based on
    the SPE. A measurement system using this sensor is described. The relative uncertainty
    obtained is about 10<sup>-2</sup> or better, and depends on the qualities of the
    electronic and optical parts of the system, the calibration process and the calculation
    algorithm.</p>"
