abstract:
- content: "<p>A new application of an optical technique is described for the determination
    of pressure in liquids under high pressures up to 0.8 GPa. The method is based
    on measurements of scattered light intensity off certain types of rough and smooth
    surfaces. Usually a prism mounted inside a high-pressure chamber is used for observing
    the angle of minimum deviation. Advantages of our technique are that it permits
    fast measurements and can be used for continuous measurements over long periods.</p>"
