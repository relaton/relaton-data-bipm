abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents a study on the influence of the diaphragm on the
    uncertainty of measurements and the repeatability of pressure steps using a TC-20
    shock tube. The tests were carried out with several diaphragms, in two different
    metrological shock tubes. A step-type transfer function was used as the input
    of the system, along with the output signal from a pressure transducer. The results
    show that, over a broad range of frequency bands, the characteristics of the diaphragm
    material and the way in which it bursts influence shock formation, causing variations
    in the gain of the output signal from the pressure transducer.</p>"
