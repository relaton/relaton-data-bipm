abstract:
- content: "<p>Two methods are presented for using conventional pressure balances
    in the pressure range 10 Pa to 10 kPa. Both these methods overcome the inability
    of a pressure balance to generate directly pressures below a limit determined
    by the mass of the floating element. The first method uses twin pressure balances,
    with the desired low pressure established above one pressure balance in terms
    of a small added mass on the other pressure balance. This method is shown to be
    capable of realizing low absolute pressures with a standard uncertainty below
    2 mPa + (9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>)p, when operating the pressure balances at 100 kPa.
    The second method uses one pressure balance in conjunction with a high-resolution
    pressure gauge. A calculable low pressure is established above the pressure balance
    either by reference to an added mass on the pressure balance or by a change in
    the pressure gauge reading. A 100 kPa pressure balance is used in combination
    with a commercial high-precision barometric pressure gauge, modified to improve
    the temperature control of its sensor. The standard uncertainty associated with
    this implementation is shown to be about 14 mPa + (9 × 10<sup>-6</sup>)p.</p>"
