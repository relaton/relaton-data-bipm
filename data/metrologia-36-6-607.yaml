  content: "<p>Progress on the development of an electrostatically suspended spinning-rotor
    vacuum gauge is described. The objective is to create a transfer standard capable
    of making consistent measurements down to 10 ÂµPa (10<sup>-7</sup> mbar), and lower
    if possible. The slowing down of the rotor due to gas pressures of this magnitude
    is very small, so its measurement in a reasonable time raises a signal-processing
    problem. The approach to this is outlined. The rotor can also change its speed
    for reasons other than impact with gas molecules. It is necessary to ensure that
    these effects are as small as possible and stable with time. One approach is to
    arrange for some of the effects to cancel one other out.</p>"
