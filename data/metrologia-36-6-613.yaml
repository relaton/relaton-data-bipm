  content: "<p>A new standard has been developed from the FRS4 piston gauge that was
    presented at the Second International Seminar organized by the Consultative Committee
    for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM), Paris, 1993. This instrument extends the
    range of absolute pressure normally achieved with pressure balances below the
    minimum 1.5 kPa. It offers improved uncertainties over series expansion calibration
    systems down to pressures of a few pascals. It also has a continuously variable
    output pressure, which provides very rapid calibrations. The vacuum FRS4 has a
    large area piston attached to an electronic balance and held centrally in the
    cylinder by flexure hinges. The resolution is 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa from 0 kPa
    to 2 kPa and 2 × 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa to 7 kPa. The reference pressure under the
    piston is maintained with a hybrid turbomolecular and triple section drag pump.
    It should be noted that in the FRS4 the reference pressure is under the piston
    rather than above as it is with normal piston gauges. The gas flowing down the
    gap between the piston and cylinder is pumped from the gap before it reaches the
    base of the piston by the intermediate stage of the hybrid pump operating in a
    split-flow mode. This allows the reference pressure to be held at 1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>
    Pa or better for the lower pressures in the measurement range and not more than
    1 × 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa above 2 kPa. The instrument is readily transportable and
    should offer a level of reproducibility of 0.01% of reading or better plus a few
    millipascals, which, until now, has not been available except in a few highly
    specialized and definitely non-portable instruments.</p>"
