  content: "<p>The sensors of capacitance diaphragm gauges (CDGs) are customarily
    kept at a stable elevated temperature. This greatly improves the zero stability
    but also introduces non-linearities at pressures below 100 Pa due to thermal transpiration.
    The effect of thermal transpiration has been measured for three CDG transducers
    and four gases - nitrogen, argon, helium and hydrogen - in a range of pressures
    from 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa to 10<sup>2</sup> Pa. Normalization of the pressure scale
    for different gases can easily be performed using the two well-known gas parameters,
    viscosity and molecular mass, thus simplifying the calculation of the thermal
    transpiration correction when the test gas is changed. A universal expression
    for the thermal transpiration correction as a function of normalized pressure
    was determined.</p>"
