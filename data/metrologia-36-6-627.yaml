  content: "<p>This paper describes a gas/oil interface height sensor for determining
    the fluid head corrections when comparing a gas-operated pressure balance with
    an oil-operated pressure balance. The sensor can also be used to establish the
    balance point of the comparison from the rate of change of the interface height.
    In the sensor, a video camera views the interface within a transparent pressure
    cell. The cell is made from a polished polycarbonate cylinder, outer diameter
    50 mm, inner diameter 10 mm, designed for a working pressure of 17 MPa. A safety
    shield surrounds the cell. The video camera magnifies the image of the interface
    and a reference scale in the cell, allowing them to be viewed remotely. The sensor
    can measure interface heights with a standard uncertainty of 0.05 mm. Results
    of a comparison of pressure balances using the sensor show that over the range
    1.6 MPa to 11 MPa, the balance points can be determined with a standard uncertainty
    of less than 4 Pa.</p>"
