abstract:
- content: "<p>To generate dynamic pressure precisely at low- and medium-pressure
    levels and in a low-frequency range, we have developed a square-wave pressure
    generator using a novel rotating valve. The main features of the valve are chambers
    in the rotor and grooves inside the stator. Pressurized air from two sources is
    continuously supplied to each chamber through the grooves. The valve switches
    the pressure alternately by its rotation, producing square-wave pressure. The
    amplitude and fundamental frequency of the generated pressure can be changed arbitrarily.
    The measured waveform is a periodic well-shaped square wave. The experimental
    results show that the repeatability of the system is good for a dynamic pressure
    source.</p>"
