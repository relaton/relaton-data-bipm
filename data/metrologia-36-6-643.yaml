  content: "<p>A bilateral comparison of high-vacuum primary standards at the Korea
    Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and the Electrotechnical Laboratory
    (ETL, Japan) was performed in the nominal range 0.004 Pa to 0.013 Pa using two
    spinning rotor gauges (designated 5 and 7) as transfer standards. The accommodation
    coefficients, sigma, of the two rotors determined by the two laboratories in an
    argon atmosphere agreed to within 2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> for rotor 5 and 3.8
    parts in 10<sup>3</sup> for rotor 7. This agreement is within the combined uncertainties
    (<italic>k</italic> = 1) of the primary standards at the two laboratories.</p>"
