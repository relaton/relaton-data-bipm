  content: "<p>This report describes pressure comparison measurements in the range
    0.07 MPa to 0.4 MPa between the Czech Institute of Metrology (CMI) and the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) in the period 9 to 13 March 1998 at the Pressure Section of
    the PTB, Braunschweig. The transfer standard used was a gas-operated piston-cylinder
    assembly with a ceramic piston of nominal effective area 10 cm<sup>2</sup> and
    a tungsten-carbide cylinder, installed in a pressure balance base unit, model
    PG 7601, manufactured by DH Instruments, USA. The measurements compare the effective
    area of the transfer piston-cylinder assembly as determined from dimensional data
    at the CMI with effective area data obtained from pressure measurements (i) in
    gauge mode with the primary standard pressure balance and (ii) in absolute and
    gauge mode with the primary standard dual-cistern mercury manometer of the PTB.
    Both primary standard instruments have been used in the international comparison
    measurements organized by the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantites
    (CCM) of the Comité International des Poids et Mesures. It may be seen that geometrical
    measurement values of the effective area is minimal: for the standard pressure
    balance, 3.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for absolute pressure, 3.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for
    gauge pressure; and for the dual-cistern mercury manometer, 1.8 × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    for gauge mode. The relative difference between the experimetnal absolute and
    gauge mode for the dual-cistern mercury manometer is 1.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>"
