abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison between the D. I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM,
    Russian Federation), the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany)
    and the Slovak Institute of Metrology (SMU, Slovakia) was organized by the VNIIM
    as the coordinator and pilot laboratory of a COOMET project that started in 1995
    and finished in 1998. The comparison was realized on the basis of cross-float
    experiments with two transfer standards - 5 cm<sup>2</sup> piston-cylinder assemblies
    for pressure balances - manufactured by, and belonging to, the VNIIM. The transfer
    standards and the methods applied to determine their effective areas, A<sub>0</sub>,
    are described and comparison results presented. With the equivalence criterion
    for the agreement between any two participants taken to be |A<sub>0i</sub> - A<sub>0j</sub>|/A<sub>0</sub>
    = 2[u<sub>i2</sub> + u<sub>j2</sub>]<sup>1/2</sup> (u being the standard uncertainty
    of the effective area of the transfer standard used), the national standards of
    the participants for the pressure range covered by the comparison experiments
    may be considered to be equivalent. As one of the participants in the present
    comparison (PTB) used the same primary standards in comparisons organized by EUROMET
    and by the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM), the participants
    in this COOMET project can indirectly compare their pressure standards with those
    of other European countries, Japan, and the United States.</p>"
