  content: "<p>A comparison between the D. I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM,
    Russian Federation), the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany)
    and the Slovak Institute of Metrology (SMU, Slovakia) was organized by the VNIIM
    as the coordinator and pilot laboratory of a COOMET project that started in 1995
    and finished in 1998. The comparison was realized on the basis of cross-float
    experiments with two transfer standards - 5 cm<sup>2</sup> piston-cylinder assemblies
    for pressure balances - manufactured by, and belonging to, the VNIIM. The transfer
    standards and the methods applied to determine their effective areas, <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>,
    are described and comparison results presented. With the equivalence criterion
    for the agreement between any two participants taken to be |<italic>A</italic><sub>0<italic>i</italic></sub>
    - <italic>A</italic><sub>0<italic>j</italic></sub>|/<italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>
    = 2[<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>2</sub> + <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>j</italic>2</sub>]<sup>1/2</sup>
    (<italic>u</italic> being the standard uncertainty of the effective area of the
    transfer standard used), the national standards of the participants for the pressure
    range covered by the comparison experiments may be considered to be equivalent.
    As one of the participants in the present comparison (PTB) used the same primary
    standards in comparisons organized by EUROMET and by the Consultative Committee
    for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM), the participants in this COOMET project
    can indirectly compare their pressure standards with those of other European countries,
    Japan, and the United States.</p>"
