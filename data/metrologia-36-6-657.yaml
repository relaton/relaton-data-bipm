abstract:
- content: "<p>The results obtained by five laboratories in the determination from
    dimensional measurements of the effective areas of two gas-operated 10 cm<sup>2</sup>
    piston-cylinder assemblies are presented. These measurements were carried out
    as phase A1 of a key comparison in the pressure range 0.05 MPa to 1 MPa under
    the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM)
    of the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures. The participants performed diameter,
    straightness and roundness measurements on each piston and cylinder bore and calculated
    the effective area of each piston-cylinder assembly using their own methods. The
    differences between diameters determined by the institutes are systematic and
    often greater than the uncertainties claimed by the participants. Nevertheless,
    all calculated effective areas agree with the reference values determined within
    the expanded uncertainties with a coverage factor 2, most of them even within
    their standard uncertainties. The choice of calculation method seems to be less
    important than the dimensional data themselves. The effective areas determined
    from the dimensional measurements are compared with those obtained in cross-float
    experiments with national pressure standards, in a comparison referred to as phase
    A2 and reported in a separate paper.</p>"
