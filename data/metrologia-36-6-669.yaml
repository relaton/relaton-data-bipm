abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a pressure comparison, covering the range 25 MPa
    to 260 MPa, carried out between the CSIRO National Measurement Laboratory (NML,
    Australia) and the Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand (MSL) in 1997
    and 1999. A feature of each part of the comparison was the high-resolution Digiquartz
    pressure transducer used as the transfer standard. This small and relatively inexpensive
    transducer is easier to transport between countries than a bulky and heavy pressure
    balance. The measured performance of the transducer demonstrates that it can compare
    the pressure scales of each laboratory to a standard uncertainty of 2.3 kPa, which
    is much smaller than the uncertainties specified for each pressure scale. The
    results of both comparisons show that the two pressure scales agree to within
    their respective uncertainties, although the 1999 comparison produced a larger
    difference than the 1997 comparison. This may indicate a change in the pressure
    balance parameters or that the transducer performance is not yet fully characterized.
    An analysis is presented to show the relationship between the measured pressure
    difference and the parameters of each pressure balance.</p>"
