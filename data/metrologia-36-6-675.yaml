abstract:
- content: "<p>The calibration system for ultra-high vacuum standards at the Korea
    Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) uses a restriction in the
    range 5 × 10<sup>-7</sup> Pa to 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa. Using this system, we
    have calibrated for argon two commercially available gauges, an extractor gauge
    and a stabil-ion gauge. The correction factor of the extractor gauge in the lower
    pressure range was about 1.07 but it rose by 4%, reaching 1.11 at 2 × 10<sup>-5</sup>
    Pa, while that of the stabil-ion gauge slowly decreased from 1.04 to 1.02 over
    four decades of the pressure range.</p>"
