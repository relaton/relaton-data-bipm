abstract:
- content: "<p>The successful realization at the National Physical Laboratory of India
    of the national practical pressure scale up to 500 MPa is described. A brief account
    is given of the metrological characterization of the controlled-clearance piston
    gauge (CCPG) used as the national primary pressure standard up to 500 MPa. The
    measured pressure with a definite uncertainty budget has been used to determine
    the effective area, A<sub>0</sub>, at atmospheric pressure at a reference temperature
    of 23 °C and the pressure distortion coefficient, λ, of the four different piston-cylinder
    assemblies used as national secondary pressure standards. Emphasis is laid on
    the establishment of the pyramid structure of the traceability hierarchy according
    to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and European Co-operation
    for Accreditation (EA) guidelines for the expression of the uncertainty of measurement
    in calibration. The metrological data obtained were found to be within the limits
    of the uncertainty budgets of international key comparisons and bilateral comparison
    measurements.</p>"
