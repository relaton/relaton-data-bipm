  content: "<p>The successful realization at the National Physical Laboratory of India
    of the national practical pressure scale up to 500 MPa is described. A brief account
    is given of the metrological characterization of the controlled-clearance piston
    gauge (CCPG) used as the national primary pressure standard up to 500 MPa. The
    measured pressure with a definite uncertainty budget has been used to determine
    the effective area, <italic>A</italic><sub>0</sub>, at atmospheric pressure at
    a reference temperature of 23 °C and the pressure distortion coefficient, λ, of
    the four different piston-cylinder assemblies used as national secondary pressure
    standards. Emphasis is laid on the establishment of the pyramid structure of the
    traceability hierarchy according to the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO) and European Co-operation for Accreditation (EA) guidelines for the expression
    of the uncertainty of measurement in calibration. The metrological data obtained
    were found to be within the limits of the uncertainty budgets of international
    key comparisons and bilateral comparison measurements.</p>"
