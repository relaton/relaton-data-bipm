  content: "<p>We discuss methods for analysing calibration data to estimate the effective
    area of a pressure balance. These include the so-called <italic>P</italic>- and
    Î”<italic>P</italic>-methods, and a method in which the estimate is made by solving
    a generalized regression problem that reflects more correctly the error structure
    in the measurement data. We compare these methods, both from a theoretical point
    of view and on simulated data, and show that the differences in the parameter
    estimates can be significant compared with the claimed measurement uncertainty.</p>"
