abstract:
- content: <p>A piston-cylinder assembly from the Ulusal Metroloji Enstitusu (TUBITAK-UME,
    Turkey) was calibrated at the Laboratoire National d'Essais (BNM-LNE, France)
    and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany) between March and
    December 1998 in the hydraulic gauge pressure range from 50 MPa to 500 MPa, using
    diethylhexyl sebacate as the pressure medium. Both institutes calibrated the assembly
    of the free-deformation type (manufacturer Desgranges et Huot, France; nominal
    effective area 2 mm<sup>2</sup>), from pressure balance comparison (cross-float)
    experiments with their primary standards and applied the "p method" to evaluate
    the calibration data. The consistency of all available calibration data was considered
    with respect to the realization of traceability in the 0.5 GPa range of hydraulic
    pressure by this method. New values of the effective area and the pressure distortion
    coefficient of the UME piston-cylinder assembly were derived from the results
    of this comparison. The present study also establishes a link to the latest EUROMET
    international comparison in the pressure range 50 MPa to 500 MPa.</p>
