  content: "<p>The Bureau National de Metrologie, Laboratoire Primaire du Temps et
    des Frequences (BNM-LPTF) Time Section is in charge of generating and disseminating
    the French atomic time scale TA(F). The latter is obtained in deferred time (1
    month) as a weighted average of individual atomic clock readings using an algorithm
    which aims to optimize the long-term stability of the resulting time scale. With
    the GPS time transfer capabilities and the new commercial caesium clocks, the
    quality of the timing data has changed dramatically. Consequently, the time-scale
    algorithm was not adapted to assign a weight to the new clocks in relation to
    their quality. So a new algorithm (TAC) has been built, with more sensitive statistical
    processing than the previous one. Tests have been carried out on real clock data
    covering the last few years; they have shown an improvement in the stability of
    the time scale. Since 1 January 1997 at 00:00:00 UT, the time scale TA(F) has
    been obtained by the algorithm TAC. Details of this new algorithm are presented.</p>"
