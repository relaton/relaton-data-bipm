abstract:
- content: "<p>A detailed analysis is presented of noise and input impedance in noise
    thermometer preamplifiers. The analysis highlights the advantages of cascode amplifiers
    and the disadvantages of amplifiers employing global feedback. Feedback gives
    rise to two significant errors, one arising from an increase in the input-noise
    current, the other from the modification of the amplifier input impedance. With
    care, the errors arising from thermal-noise sources associated with the preamplifiers
    can be kept below 1 mK. However the largest error associated with the preamplifiers,
    typically 10 mK to 30 mK and previously unnoticed, arises from the interaction
    of the input capacitance and the transmission line inductance. This effect negates
    the common practice of matching the RC time constants in noise thermometers.</p>"
