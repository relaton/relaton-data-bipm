abstract:
- content: "<p>The hybrid character of the terms percent, parts per million and parts
    in 10<sup>n</sup> means that we should refrain from using them in scientific language.
    A clear and precise statement of the quantity considered would in all cases allow
    its value to be expressed as a simple number.</p>"
