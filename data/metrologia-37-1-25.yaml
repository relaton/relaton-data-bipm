  content: "<p>A new class of sensor has recently appeared: nanometre sensors. These
    sensors are characterized by nanometre or sub-nanometre resolution and an uncertainty
    of a few nanometres over a range of at least several micrometres. Instruments
    such as capacitive or inductive sensors, laser interferometers, holographic scales,
    and scanning probe microscopes belong to the class of nanometre sensors. Linearity
    errors and drift in the mechanical and electronic system limit the accuracy of
    all these sensors. In order to determine these errors in a traceable way, the
    instrumentation described in this paper was developed. The heart of the system
    consists of a Fabry-Perot cavity. One mirror of this cavity generates the required
    displacement. A so-called slave laser is stabilized to the cavity length. The
    frequency of this slave laser is compared with the frequency of a primary length
    standard. In this way the displacement is measured with a resolution of a few
    picometres, a range of 300 µm and an uncertainty of about 1 nm. Experiments confirm
    the performance of this instrument and show typical deviations of the probe systems
    investigated.</p>"
