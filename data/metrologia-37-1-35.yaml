abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports the results of the first key comparison of primary
    standard gas mixtures (PSMs), held under the auspices of the Consultative Committee
    for Amount of Substance (CCQM). PSMs are (national) measurement standards for
    the realization of specific gas mixture compositions. This key comparison, registered
    at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) as CCQM-K1.a-g, encompasses
    thirteen different gas mixture compositions. In total, 125 transfer standards
    were prepared and distributed among ten participating institutes. The results
    show that joint activities in the development and maintenance of PSMs lead to
    a relative agreement within 10<sup>-2</sup> of the reference values for the results
    of the international comparison.</p>"
