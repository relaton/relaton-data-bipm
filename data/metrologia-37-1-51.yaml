  content: "<p>An international comparison of the spectral radiance scales of the
    National Physical Laboratory (NPL), the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) was carried out in
    1993 and 1994, under the auspices of the Comité Consultatif de Photométrie et
    Radiométrie (CCPR) of the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM). The
    comparison covered the spectral range 200 nm to 350 nm. The transfer standards
    were deuterium discharge lamps, with examples of the lamps used at each of the
    participating laboratories included in the comparison to aid in the identification
    of systematic errors and to gather information on their relative performance.
    The scales of the laboratories agreed within the combined uncertainties. However,
    the combined uncertainties were high (an expanded uncertainty with a coverage
    factor of <italic>k</italic> = 2 of up to 8 %), and further work is required to
    reduce the uncertainties associated with the spectral radiance scales of each
    laboratory. Little difference was observed in the performance of the three different
    transfer standard sources used.</p>"
