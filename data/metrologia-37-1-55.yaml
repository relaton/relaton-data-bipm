  content: "<p>In a first attempt to evaluate performance of the Global Navigation
    Satellite System (GLONASS) precise-code time transfer, one-site measurements are
    used to show that single-channel GLONASS P-code, combined with temperature-stabilized
    antennas, reduces the noise experienced by time-receiving equipment to a few hundred
    picoseconds over an averaging time of one day, thus allowing frequency comparison
    at a level of a few parts in 10<sup>15</sup>.</p>"
