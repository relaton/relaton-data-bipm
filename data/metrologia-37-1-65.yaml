  content: "<p>Changes in the display of a mass balance caused by the effect of the
    earth's magnetic field were measured at the Korea Research Institute of Standards
    and Science (KRISS) using the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)
    susceptometer operating in a Helmholtz coil system. The experimental results concerning
    this effect generally agreed with the theoretical predictions within the uncertainty
    of the balance (about 1 Âµg). A few anomalies were noted and are discussed in the
    text.</p>"
