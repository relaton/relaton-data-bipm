  content: "<p>The high-vacuum standards of the Korea Research Institute of Standards
    and Science (KRISS) and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in the UK have
    been compared over the pressure range 4.5 × 10<sup>-3</sup> Pa to 1.25 × 10<sup>-2</sup>
    Pa using argon as the reference gas. Despite large instabilities in the characteristics
    of the transfer standards, the maximum difference between the data obtained at
    the KRISS and those obtained at the NPL is less than the combined uncertainty
    (<italic>k</italic> = 2) for the two standards.</p>"
