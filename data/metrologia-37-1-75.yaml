  content: <p>Within the framework of globalization of the economy, questions are
    increasingly being asked concerning the "privatization" of national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) and the growth of competition in the field of metrology. This
    paper analyses the characteristic fields of duty of NMIs in the light of competition
    and cooperation at the national, regional and global levels. The conclusion drawn
    is that, in order to increase the efficiency of metrological activities, some
    competition should be permitted. However, excessive competition should be avoided
    in order to guarantee sustainability. In view of the diversity of bodies involved,
    of the present situation at all levels, and of the different effects of competition
    on the typical fields of duty of NMIs, the aim should not be competition at any
    price, but task-specific competition. Nevertheless, the metrological competence
    of an NMI cannot be completely self-financing, so the responsibility of the state
    will basically be preserved. Proposals are made that could contribute to achieving
    the desirable aim of globalization of metrology.</p>
