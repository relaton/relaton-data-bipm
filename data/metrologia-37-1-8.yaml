abstract:
- content: <p>The Welch-Satterthwaite approximation is used to estimate an "effective
    degrees of freedom" for a probability distribution formed from several independent
    normal distributions for which only estimates of the variance are known. The International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement recommends its use for the calculation of expanded uncertainties
    (the ISO term for confidence intervals) for uncertainties formed from several
    distributions. Although it is well recognized that this formula is an approximation,
    counter-intuitive results may be obtained when a variance estimate of the dominant
    distribution has a small number of degrees of freedom; the calculated confidence
    limits are sometimes found to decrease with increases in the contributing uncertainties.</p>
