  content: "<p>The hybrid character of the terms percent, parts per million and parts
    in 10<sup><italic>n</italic></sup> means that we should refrain from using them
    in scientific language. A clear and precise statement of the quantity considered
    would in all cases allow its value to be expressed as a simple number.</p>"
