  content: "<p>In angle calibrations the uncertainty contributions of the autocollimator
    and index table are easily estimated as these uncertainties are well documented,
    but it is more difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with flatness
    deviations, eccentricity and pyramidal errors of the measuring faces. Deviations
    in the flatness of angle surfaces have been held responsible for the lack of agreement
    in angle comparisons. An investigation has been carried out using a small-angle
    generator and an autocollimator to determine the effect of flatness deviations
    of the measuring surfaces on angle measurements. The small-angle generator, together
    with a translation stage and tilt table, was also used to determine the effect
    of eccentricity and pyramidal errors. These methods were developed to calculate
    the related uncertainties associated with flatness deviations, eccentricity and
    pyramidal errors on face-to-face angle measurements. The results show that flatness
    and eccentricity deviations have less effect on angle measurements than do pyramidal
    errors.</p>"
