abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports the fifth set of results of a series of grouped
    laser comparisons from national laboratories undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the request of the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition
    du Mètre (CCDM, now the Consultative Committee for Length, CCL), during the period
    July 1993 to September 1995.</p><p>The results of this comparison, involving six
    lasers from five countries and the BIPM, meet the goals set by the CCDM in 1992
    and adopted by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) the same year.
    The standard uncertainty (1 σ) of the frequency of the He-Ne laser stabilized
    on the saturated absorption of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at λ = 633 nm is reduced
    to a level of 12 kHz (2.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) when the lasers compared meet
    the recommended values of the parameters.</p><p>The lasers were first compared
    with the BIPMP3 or the CSIRO1 lasers, with all the lasers set to the parameter
    values normally used in each laboratory; the results ranged from -48.3 kHz to
    13.8 kHz. After checking and readjusting the values of all the parameters, the
    range was reduced to -14.7 kHz to 10.4 kHz. Under the latter conditions, the average
    frequency difference of the group of lasers with respect to the BIPM4 laser was
    -0.5 kHz with a standard uncertainty (1 σ) of 8.5 kHz. The best relative frequency
    stabilities, with Allan standard deviations of about 3.5 parts in 10<sup>12</sup>
    and 3.5 parts in 10<sup>13</sup>, were observed with sampling times of 8 s and
    2048 s, respectively.</p>"
