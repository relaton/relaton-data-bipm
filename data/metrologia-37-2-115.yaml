abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports the sixth set of results of a series of grouped
    laser comparisons from national laboratories undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the request of the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition
    du Mètre (CCDM, now the Consultative Committee for Length, CCL), during the period
    July 1993 to September 1995.</p><p>The results of this comparison, involving six
    lasers from four countries and the BIPM, with the exception of one laser meet
    the goals set by the CCDM in 1992 and adopted by the Comité International des
    Poids et Mesures (CIPM) the same year. The standard uncertainty of the frequency
    of the He-Ne laser stabilized on the saturated absorption of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    at λ = 633 nm is reduced to a level of 12 kHz (2.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) when
    the lasers compared meet the recommended values of the parameters.</p><p>The lasers
    were first compared with the BIPM4 laser with the operating parameters set to
    the values normally used in each laboratory. Using the BIPM4 laser as a reference
    the results ranged from -108.9 kHz to 44.5 kHz. After checking and readjusting
    the values of all the parameters, the range was reduced to -34.5 kHz to +1.1 kHz.
    Under the latter conditions, the average frequency difference of the group of
    lasers with respect to the BIPM4 laser was -7.5 kHz with a standard uncertainty
    (1 σ) of 15.1 kHz. The best relative frequency stabilities, with Allan standard
    deviations of about 1.7 × 10<sup>-12</sup> and 2.2 × 10<sup>-13</sup>, were observed
    with sampling times of 10 s and 1000 s, respectively. The overall best value was
    1.1 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for a sampling time of 3000 s.</p>"
