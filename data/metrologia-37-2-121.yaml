abstract:
- content: "<p>A fringe-pattern analysing interferometer with a resolution of 1 Ã—
    10<sup>-9</sup>, stablility of readings of about 0.1 nm, and an uncertainty owing
    to optical effects of less than 1 nm, has been used to study some systematic effects
    in gauge block length measurements. Measurements on steel and quartz plates with
    sub-nanometre reproducibility are reported. An accuracy of about 1 nm is demonstrated
    for a combination of reproducible wringing and slave-block techniques. The limitations
    of the present definition of the length of a gauge block are highlighted. A double-sided
    method for length measurement of gauge blocks has been realized, the results of
    which are not affected by excessive thickness of the wringing film and which incorporate
    a correction on the interferometer optics.</p>"
