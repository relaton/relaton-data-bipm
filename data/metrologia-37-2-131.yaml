abstract:
- content: "<p>A description is presented of an upgraded trap-detector-based realization
    of the units of luminous intensity (candela) and illuminance (lux) at the Helsinki
    University of Technology (HUT). The realization is accomplished using a reference
    photometer, a light source and a distance-measurement system. A thorough characterization
    is presented of the reference photometer, consisting of a reflection trap detector,
    a temperature-controlled V(λ) filter and a high-precision aperture. The maintenance
    of the units is described. An updated uncertainty budget of the realization is
    given. Two of the three main uncertainty components of our earlier realizations
    have been significantly decreased. The uncertainty analysis indicates a relative
    expanded uncertainty of 2.2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for the realization of the candela
    and 1.8 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for that of the lux. The HUT has participated in three
    international measurement comparisons, whose results are reviewed. According to
    the results, the HUT candela deviates by +4.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> from the candela
    of the Swedish National Testing and Research Institute with an expanded uncertainty
    of 10<sup>-2</sup>, -2.7 × 10<sup>-3</sup> from that of the National Physical
    Laboratory (UK) with an expanded uncertainty of 5.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup> and -3.3
    × 10<sup>-3</sup> from the world mean with an expanded uncertainty of 5.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p>"
