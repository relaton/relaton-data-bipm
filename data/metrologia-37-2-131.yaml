  content: "<p>A description is presented of an upgraded trap-detector-based realization
    of the units of luminous intensity (candela) and illuminance (lux) at the Helsinki
    University of Technology (HUT). The realization is accomplished using a reference
    photometer, a light source and a distance-measurement system. A thorough characterization
    is presented of the reference photometer, consisting of a reflection trap detector,
    a temperature-controlled <italic>V</italic>(λ) filter and a high-precision aperture.
    The maintenance of the units is described. An updated uncertainty budget of the
    realization is given. Two of the three main uncertainty components of our earlier
    realizations have been significantly decreased. The uncertainty analysis indicates
    a relative expanded uncertainty of 2.2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for the realization of
    the candela and 1.8 × 10<sup>-3</sup> for that of the lux. The HUT has participated
    in three international measurement comparisons, whose results are reviewed. According
    to the results, the HUT candela deviates by +4.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> from the candela
    of the Swedish National Testing and Research Institute with an expanded uncertainty
    of 10<sup>-2</sup>, -2.7 × 10<sup>-3</sup> from that of the National Physical
    Laboratory (UK) with an expanded uncertainty of 5.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup> and -3.3
    × 10<sup>-3</sup> from the world mean with an expanded uncertainty of 5.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>.</p>"
