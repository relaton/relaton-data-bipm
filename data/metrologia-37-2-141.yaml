abstract:
- content: <p>The Istituto di Metrologia "G. Colonnetti" (IMGC, Italy), the Laboratoire
    National d'Essais (LNE, France) and the Mittatekniikan Keskus (MIKES, Finland)
    support primary calibration facilities used both for liquid density measurements
    and for hydrometer calibrations. In 1998, two independent bilateral comparisons
    of the calibration of standard hydrometers were carried out between the IMGC and
    the LNE and between the IMGC and the MIKES, the main purpose being to assess the
    present state of mutual compatibility in the density range 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup>
    to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> among the three laboratories. The results show agreement
    within the uncertainties declared by the laboratories, although the MIKES measurements
    are in general 0.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup> lower than those of the IMGC and the LNE measurements
    are systematically 0.04 kg/m<sup>3</sup> higher than those of the IMGC. Both differences
    are smaller than half of the least-scale division of the transfer hydrometer used.</p>
