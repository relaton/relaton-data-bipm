abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental characterization is presented of sub-Doppler modulation
    transfer spectroscopy using He-Ne lasers and rovibronic transitions of the iodine
    molecule at the wavelength of 612 nm. With this technique, the realized optical
    frequency standard shows a minimum stability value of 6.2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> in
    1000 s of integration time, and an estimated reproducibility of 7 kHz (1.6 × 10<sup>-11</sup>).
    The hyperfine spectroscopy of the recommended transition 9-2, R(47) was also carried
    out using this method. Finally, the performance of the optical frequency standard
    and the hyperfine spectroscopy results are compared with those obtained using
    the frequency modulation spectroscopy technique.</p>"
