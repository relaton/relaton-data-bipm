  content: "<p>A system of interferometric length measurements has been realized that
    supports wringing and phase change errors of  1 nm. In this system, special reference
    blocks allowing reproducible wringing are used to find the relation between optical
    and mechanical lengths. The optical length of a reference block is found by the
    double-sided method on a quartz plate. The mechanical length is found by the combination
    of the reproducible wringing and slave-block techniques. A comparison of these
    two length values gives the phase change at the optical reflection, which is then
    used to find the mechanical length from the double-sided measurement results of
    a block of arbitrary length (up to 100 nm). The proposed system makes it possible
    to measure the phase change difference between the blocks with sub-nanometre accuracy.
    The system can be used for the practical realization of an alternative definition
    of the length of a material artefact, based on the perpendicular distance between
    its mechanical surfaces. Precise measurements of the excessive thickness of the
    wringing film, which is included in the present definition of the length of a
    block, are demonstrated. Standard single-sided measurements on quartz are shown
    to have some additional uncertainty relative to standard measurements on steel
    plates.</p>"
