abstract:
- content: "<p>An on-site comparison of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) resistance standards
    of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and of the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made in April 1999. Measurements
    of a 100 Ω standard in terms of the conventional value of the von Klitzing constant,
    R<sub>K-90</sub>, agreed to 12 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with a relative combined
    standard uncertainty u<sub>c</sub> = 20 × 10<sup>-10</sup>. Measurements of 10
    000 Ω/100 Ω and 100 Ω/1 Ω ratios agreed to 59 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with u<sub>c</sub>
    = 55 × 10<sup>-10</sup> and to 38 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with u<sub>c</sub>
    = 31 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, respectively.</p>"
