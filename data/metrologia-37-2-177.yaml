  content: <p>An international comparison of two I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized frequency-doubled
    Nd:YAG lasers at λ = 532 nm has been performed between the Istituto di Metrologia
    "G. Colonnetti" (IMGC)/Politecnico di Milano (PoliMI) and the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB). Both lasers used saturated absorption of the P(54) 32-0 iodine
    transition as a frequency reference. The signals for stabilizing the lasers were
    obtained using the frequency modulation spectroscopy technique with an external
    iodine cell. A minimum value for the relative Allan standard deviation of 7 ×
    10<sup>-14</sup> was reached after an integration time of 40 s. The hyperfine
    line separations were measured by the beat-frequency method and compared with
    the frequency values recently reported by Ye and co-workers. Three different iodine
    cells were investigated. The range of frequency differences for the iodine cells
    IMGCQU and PTB1/98 between the two lasers was from -9 kHz to 7.3 kHz with a mean
    of 1.2 kHz and a standard deviation of 3.5 kHz. Taking into account the measured
    frequency offsets of the different iodine cells, the evaluated frequency repeatability
    of the optical standards was within 2.5 kHz.</p>
