abstract:
- content: "<p>Linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTECs) of two kinds of ceramic
    gauge block (seven in all) and steel gauge blocks (four in all) were measured
    in the range -10°C to 60°C with an optical heterodyne interferometric dilatometer.
    The dilatometer has an uncertainty and reproducibility of the order of 1 × 10<sup>-9</sup>
    K<sup>-1</sup> in LTEC measurements. LTECs of (9.229 ± 0.011) × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    K<sup>-1</sup> were obtained for four 2% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> partially
    stabilized zirconia (PSZ) gauge blocks; (9.381 ± 0.003) × 10<sup>-6</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>
    for three 99.9% PSZ gauge blocks; and (10.702 ± 0.064) × 10<sup>-6</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>
    for four steel gauge blocks. These results are discussed in relation to the compositions
    and production batches of the gauge blocks.</p>"
