abstract:
- content: "<p>A set of eight gauge blocks, two steel platens, and two quartz platens
    was circulated to ten European laboratories, plus laboratories in the United States
    and Australia, in order to compare methods for measuring a phase correction when
    obtaining the interferometric length of a gauge block. Measurements were made
    of the central length and a phase correction for each gauge block. The participants
    were free to use any method to measure phase correction. The four methods used
    were: (i) the phase stack technique; (ii) optical scattering methods; (iii) stylus
    profilometry; and (iv) a mechanical contacting technique. The results of the measurements
    of central length showed a linear secular decrease as the project progressed,
    the total change in length being about 30 nm to 40 nm. Within a 95 % confidence
    level, the central length measurements all agree, but the phase correction results
    vary by as much as 30 nm in the worst case. Significant changes to the gauge block
    surfaces were recorded: the scratch content increased and there was evidence of
    a reaction of the surfaces with the box in which they were housed.</p>"
