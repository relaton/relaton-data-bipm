  content: <p>The use of isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) to make measurements
    of amount of substance that are traceable to the International System of Units
    (SI) depends on an analysis of possible sources of uncertainty. A comprehensive
    application is presented of the law of propagation of uncertainty to the two-way
    IDMS method, which allows sensitivity coefficients to be calculated and optimum
    regimes identified for carrying out IDMS measurements. This has allowed the effect
    of deviations from "exact matching" on the uncertainty of the measurement to be
    evaluated for the first time. Furthermore, the relationship between traceability
    and uncertainty has been investigated for the two-way IDMS method, which is shown
    to have the potential to be a primary ratio method and to provide traceability
    to the SI. Our analysis shows that proper consideration of correlation in the
    uncertainty calculation and appropriate experimental design can reduce the requirement
    for highly characterized spike reference materials.</p>
