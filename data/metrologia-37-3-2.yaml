abstract:
- content: "<p>The uncertainty is evaluated of a calibration method allowing the determination
    of complex sensitivities of accelerometers in an acceleration range of 10<sup>2</sup>
    m s<sup>-2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> m s<sup>-2</sup> and a frequency band of 10<sup>3</sup>
    Hz to 10<sup>4</sup> Hz. The method uses elastic waves in a thin circular bar
    to generate input acceleration and an optical interferometer to evaluate the input.
    The uncertainty in the magnitude of the complex sensitivities is estimated to
    be of the order of 10<sup>-2</sup> and that in the phase shift of the order of
    10<sup>-2</sup> rad, in the frequency range where the accelerometer signal and
    the interferometer signal have sufficient spectral intensity. Note that this paper
    deals with a special case of the calibration of a back-to-back accelerometer,
    in the frequency domain rather than in the time domain.</p>"
