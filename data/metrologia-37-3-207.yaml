  content: "<p>The quantum metrological triangle experiment, which is under development
    at the Bureau National de Métrologie-Laboratoire Central des Industries Électriques
    (BNM-LCIE), consists of applying Ohm's law directly to the quantities related
    to the single-electron tunnelling (SET) effect, the ac Josephson effect (JE) and
    the quantum Hall effect (QHE). The goal of this experiment is to test, at a significant
    level of uncertainty of about 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>, the coherence of the constants
    involved in these three quantum phenomena: the Josephson constant <italic>K</italic><sub>J</sub>,
    expected to correspond to the ratio 2<italic>e</italic>/<italic>h</italic> (where
    <italic>e</italic> is the elementary charge and <italic>h</italic> the Planck
    constant); the von Klitzing constant <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>, in relation
    to the quantum resistance <italic>h</italic>/<italic>e</italic><sup>2</sup>; and
    a new constant <italic>Q</italic><sub>X</sub>, defined here as the estimate of
    <italic>e</italic>. Moreover, realization of the metrological triangle experiment,
    combined with the experiment being developed at the NIST aimed at charging a capacitor
    by means of a SET pump, will give information liable to be taken into account
    in future adjustments of the fundamental constants without requiring any hypothesis
    regarding the physical phenomena involved. The combination of these two experiments
    should yield a new value of <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub> in ohms of the International
    System of Units (SI). The broad outlines of our experimental set-up are given,
    along with the expected uncertainties in both the short and long terms.</p>"
