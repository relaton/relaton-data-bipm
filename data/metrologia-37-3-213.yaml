abstract:
- content: "<p>Fifteen national and territorial metrology institutes in the Asia-Pacific
    region have taken part in a comparison of dc voltage coordinated by the National
    Measurement Centre of the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board. A Zener
    cell was used as the travelling standard in the comparison. A mathematical model
    based on a first-order differential equation is developed to describe the influence
    of time, temperature, and humidity on the Zener voltage. The results of comparisons
    with Josephson array voltage standards (JAVSs) in seven different laboratories
    agree well with data predicted by the model.</p>"
