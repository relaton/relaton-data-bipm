  content: "<p>A high-precision standard has been established to create a dc magnetic
    field in the expanded geomagnetic range 10 µT to 110 µT. Over this range the systematic
    standard uncertainty of the total magnetic field is (0.003 − 0.03) nT, with a
    random standard deviation of 0.002 nT, inside a sphere 10 cm in diameter. The
    uncertainty of the magnetic-field direction is 1 second of arc. A new type of
    three-component coil system, with an enlarged working space and an advanced potassium
    magnetic-field stabilizer, has been designed. The standard is intended for the
    calibration of high-precision geomagnetometers.</p>"
