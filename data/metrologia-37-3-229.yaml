  content: "<p>An investigation is presented on the influence of impurity concentration
    and magnetic field on the superconducting transition of high-purity commercial
    titanium samples. Run-to-run and sample-to-sample reproducibility is evaluated
    for the purest titanium specimen. Past work on the superconducting transition
    of titanium is reviewed, and the suitability of titanium as a thermometric reference
    point is discussed.</p>"
