abstract:
- content: "<p>A vertical nickel cell made from an alumina crucible was constructed
    for thermocouple calibration, and its melting and freezing behaviours were investigated.
    The freezing plateau was found to be very flat, with a depression of only 65 mK
    over 130 min. The Ni freezing point proved very practical, both thermodynamically
    and economically, in comparison with the palladium freezing point. It is strongly
    suggested that more extensive studies should be carried out on the Ni freezing
    point so that it can be used as a new primary-grade fixed point.</p>"
