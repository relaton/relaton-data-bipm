  content: "<p>A regional key comparison for the calibration of cylindrical diameter
    standards was carried out within EUROMET between 1996 and 1998. Twelve laboratories
    from European national metrology institutes took part, the Swiss Federal Office
    of Metrology (OFMET) acting as the pilot laboratory. The standards to be calibrated
    were three ring gauges of diameters 3 mm, 40 mm and 90 mm, and two plug gauges
    of diameters 2.5 mm and 50 mm. The measurand to be determined was the diameter
    of the standard in a given direction at three heights. Owing to the large variety
    of measuring instruments used by the participating laboratories, ranging from
    highly specialized, state-of-the-art equipment to commercial, multi-purpose length-measuring
    machines, the stated uncertainties vary to a large extent. Since the corresponding
    key comparison (CCL-K4) of the Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM)
    has not yet started, it was appropriate to calculate preliminary reference values
    for this regional comparison. The deviations with respect to these preliminary
    reference values are in most cases smaller than the expanded uncertainty of these
    differences.</p>"
