abstract:
- content: "<p>The quantum metrological triangle experiment, which is under development
    at the Bureau National de Métrologie-Laboratoire Central des Industries Électriques
    (BNM-LCIE), consists of applying Ohm's law directly to the quantities related
    to the single-electron tunnelling (SET) effect, the ac Josephson effect (JE) and
    the quantum Hall effect (QHE). The goal of this experiment is to test, at a significant
    level of uncertainty of about 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>, the coherence of the constants
    involved in these three quantum phenomena: the Josephson constant K<sub>J</sub>,
    expected to correspond to the ratio 2e/h (where e is the elementary charge and
    h the Planck constant); the von Klitzing constant R<sub>K</sub>, in relation to
    the quantum resistance h/e<sup>2</sup>; and a new constant Q<sub>X</sub>, defined
    here as the estimate of e. Moreover, realization of the metrological triangle
    experiment, combined with the experiment being developed at the NIST aimed at
    charging a capacitor by means of a SET pump, will give information liable to be
    taken into account in future adjustments of the fundamental constants without
    requiring any hypothesis regarding the physical phenomena involved. The combination
    of these two experiments should yield a new value of R<sub>K</sub> in ohms of
    the International System of Units (SI). The broad outlines of our experimental
    set-up are given, along with the expected uncertainties in both the short and
    long terms.</p>"
