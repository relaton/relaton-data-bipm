abstract:
- content: "<p>The band responsivities of radiometers for measuring ultraviolet irradiance
    or dosage in the UVA, UVB and UVC spectral regions are source-dependent and require
    spectrally weighted measurements for calibration. Currently, however, many industrial
    users lack knowledge of this and may use a radiometer originally calibrated using
    one particular type of source to measure UV radiation from a source of a different
    type. Worse still, when this radiometer is later sent for recalibration, the calibration
    laboratory could use a source of a third type. This problem results in considerable
    discrepancies, as high as 20 % to 50 %, in the calibration of UV radiometers,
    and consequent errors in actual measurements. Efforts are being made by the International
    Commission on Illumination (CIE) to standardize the calibration method and industrial
    uses of UV radiometers. This paper reviews the measurement principles of broadband
    radiometers and examines, both theoretically and experimentally, the effects of
    spectral distribution on the responsivities of several commonly used UV sources.
    The analysis agrees well with the experimental results. The methods of characterization
    and calibration of these radiometers are also discussed in detail.</p>"
