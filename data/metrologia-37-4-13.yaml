abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of form measurements initiated by the International
    Institution for Production Engineering Research (CIRP) was completed between 1996
    and 1998. The participants were chosen from national metrology institutes, academic
    institutions and industrial users of coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) and
    form testers. The measurands were roundness, straightness and parallelism. The
    artefacts under test were chosen partly because of their larger form deviations.
    As CMMs and form testers were both used for the measurements, a direct comparison
    of their specific measurement abilities is possible.</p>"
