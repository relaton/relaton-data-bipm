  content: "<p>A new modern cryogenic radiometer facility has recently been installed
    at the Centro National de Metrologia (CENAM), Querétaro, Mexico. The radiometer
    head is a CryoRad II (CRI Inc., Boston, USA). In a specially designed laboratory
    with clean-room atmosphere, the facility is now ready for calibrations of detectors
    with power-stabilized laser radiation. This cryogenic radiometer facility will
    be the basis for most of the radiometric and photometric calibrations of the CENAM.
    A first radiometric comparison between the CENAM and the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, was carried out with trap detectors at the He-Ne
    laser wavelength of 632.8 nm. Two reflection trap detectors, each with three photodiodes,
    were used: one with 10 mm × 10 mm and the other with 18 mm × 18 mm Si photodiodes.
    The results were very encouraging. At power levels of about 100 µW the calibrations
    showed a relative difference of 7 × 10<sup>-5</sup> or even less. The PTB calibrations
    are based on a modified LaseRad II (CRI) radiometer that has been compared with
    cryogenic radiometers of other types and from other national metrology institutes.</p>"
