  content: "<p>A current project at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC)
    is to realize a new near-infrared (NIR) spectral-responsivity scale in the range
    900 nm to 1600 nm using the NRC monochromator-based cryogenic radiometer facility.
    A major part of this work consists of developing high-accuracy transfer radiometers
    for this spectral range. A new type of transfer radiometer incorporating a small
    integrating sphere and three 5 mm diameter InGaAs detectors is described. The
    following properties of these so-called sphere radiometers are discussed: spectral
    responsivity, spatial uniformity, angular variation of responsivity, temperature
    sensitivity, and linearity. These radiometers have a relatively high responsivity
    even though they incorporate integrating spheres: the peak responsivity is close
    to 0.3 A/W, compared with approximately 1.0 A/W for 5 mm or 10 mm diameter InGaAs
    detectors. In particular, the radiometers are uniform to better than 1 part in
    103 and the angular variation is less than 3 parts in 104 for ± 5° incidence,
    throughout the spectral range 900 nm to 1600 nm. A brief analysis is presented
    of the uncertainties associated with the realization of a spectral-responsivity
    scale in the NIR using the above radiometers and the NRC cryogenic radiometer
    facility.</p>"
