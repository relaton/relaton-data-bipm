  content: "<p>The propagation of uncertainty on measurement scales that are based
    on polynomial interpolation is described. Reformulation of the interpolation in
    terms of Lagrange polynomials, which are orthogonal over the set of measured variables,
    provides the key mathematical simplification. Consequently, with many uncertainty
    calculations the correlation terms do not need to be carried, and the effects
    of the various sources of uncertainty are easily visualized. Indeed, once a user
    is familiar with Lagrange interpolation, both the interpolation equation and the
    uncertainty equation can often be written down by inspection without the need
    for any intermediate calculation. The method is applied to both the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) and multiwavelength radiation thermometry to
    highlight the advantages of the Lagrange approach and to illustrate some of the
    advantages and disadvantages of interpolated scales. Several means of estimating
    the additional uncertainty arising from interpolation error are also discussed.</p>"
