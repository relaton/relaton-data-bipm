abstract:
- content: <p>Black-body radiators, generally consisting of a nearly isothermal cavity
    with a surface of high intrinsic emissivity, are used in radiation thermometry
    for the transfer of a temperature scale to a radiation thermometer from either
    a contact thermometer or another radiation thermometer. The emissivity of these
    black bodies is typically greater than 0.99, and is usually estimated by calculation.
    In the commonly used 7 µm to 14 µm band, several factors conspire to make this
    calculation less satisfactory, and a technique is required to confirm the calculation
    by direct measurement of the cavity emissivity. A simple technique is presented
    for determining the average normal-hemispherical reflectance, and hence emissivity,
    of a cavity radiator over this wavelength region. An uncertainty of 0.0002 (k
    = 2) in emissivity is achieved, and experimentally measured and calculated emissivities
    are presented for the cavities used at the National Measurement Laboratory (NML,
    Australia) for radiation thermometer calibration. An assessment is also made of
    the reflectance of an "ice-cavity" radiator.</p>
