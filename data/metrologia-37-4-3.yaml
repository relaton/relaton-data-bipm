abstract:
- content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt has further improved and
    extended its spectral responsivity scale based on the laser-operated radiation
    thermometry cryogenic radiometer. Five laser wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV)
    (238 nm to 400 nm) and another fifteen in the visible and near-infrared (NIR)
    (400 nm to 1015 nm) almost cover the entire spectral range where silicon photodiodes
    can be used in air. The lasers employed are a Kr<sup>+</sup> laser, an Ar<sup>+</sup>
    laser with optional intra-cavity frequency-doubling, and a continuously tuneable
    Ti:sapphire ring laser. The total relative standard uncertainty of the spectral
    responsivity at the laser lines is u = 10<sup>-4</sup> in the visible and NIR
    below 950 nm and u = 10<sup>-3</sup> in the UV. With an improved model for interpolation
    between the laser wavelengths, a continuous scale of spectral responsivity has
    been established in the wavelength range 400 nm to 1015 nm.</p>"
