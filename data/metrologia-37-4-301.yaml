  content: "<p>The unwieldy term 'amount of substance' for the base quantity <italic>n</italic>
    has led to conflicting authoritative choices for abbreviations, especially when
    forming terms for derived quantities. A proposed substitute, the neologism 'chemon',
    is a derivative from the Greek χηµϵα (chemistry). A systematic terminology is
    achieved by forming derivatives and complex terms in the usual way, e.g. 'chemonity'
    (<italic>n</italic><sub>B</sub>/<italic>m</italic><sub>solvent</sub>), 'chemon
    concentration' (<italic>n</italic><sub>B</sub>/<italic>V</italic><sub>system</sub>),
    'chemonic volume' (<italic>V</italic>/<italic>n</italic><sub>B</sub>). The harmonization
    of terms in thirteen European languages is accomplished according to the respective
    linguistic rules.</p>"
