abstract:
- content: "<p>The unwieldy term 'amount of substance' for the base quantity n has
    led to conflicting authoritative choices for abbreviations, especially when forming
    terms for derived quantities. A proposed substitute, the neologism 'chemon', is
    a derivative from the Greek χηµϵα (chemistry). A systematic terminology is achieved
    by forming derivatives and complex terms in the usual way, e.g. 'chemonity' (n<sub>B</sub>/m<sub>solvent</sub>),
    'chemon concentration' (n<sub>B</sub>/V<sub>system</sub>), 'chemonic volume' (V/n<sub>B</sub>).
    The harmonization of terms in thirteen European languages is accomplished according
    to the respective linguistic rules.</p>"
