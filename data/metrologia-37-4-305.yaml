abstract:
- content: "<p>A method of measuring the absolute spectral irradiance of quartz-halogen-tungsten
    lamps is described, based on the known responsivity of a filter radiometer, the
    components of which are separately characterized. The characterization is described
    for the wide wavelength range essential for deriving the spectrum of a lamp, from
    260 nm to 950 nm. Novel methods of interpolation and measurement are implemented
    for the spectral responsivity of the filter radiometer. The combined standard
    uncertainty of spectral irradiance measurements is less than 1.4 parts in 10<sup>2</sup>
    from 290 nm to 320 nm (ultraviolet B) and 4 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> from 440 nm
    to 900 nm (visible to near-infrared). As an example, the derived spectral irradiances
    of two lamps measured at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT, Finland)
    are presented and compared with the measurement results of the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB, Germany). The comparisons indicate that the HUT spectral irradiance scale
    is between those of the NIST and the PTB in the wavelength range 290 nm to 900
    nm. The long-term reproducibility of the spectral irradiance measurements is also
    presented. Over a period of two years, the reproducibility appears to be better
    than 1 part in 10<sup>2</sup>.</p>"
