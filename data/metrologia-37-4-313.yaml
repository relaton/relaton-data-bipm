abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of 10 pF and 100 pF capacitance standards
    has taken place within the framework of EUROMET. The comparison, which was piloted
    by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK), involved seventeen laboratories,
    including several which are members of other regional organizations. The agreement
    demonstrated by the comparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability
    for the farad, via either a calculable capacitor or a quantum Hall resistance
    (QHR) standard and the internationally agreed value of RK-90. However, the results
    appear to show that there are slight but significant differences between the representation
    of the farad for some laboratories. A full report of the comparison has been published
    by the NPL.</p>"
