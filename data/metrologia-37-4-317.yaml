abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports the seventh set of results of a series of grouped
    laser comparisons from national laboratories undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the request of the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition
    du Mètre (CCDM, now the Consultative Committee for Length, CCL), during the periods
    July 1993 to September 1995 and March to July 1997.</p><p>The results of this
    comparison, involving six lasers from three countries of North America and from
    the BIPM, meet the goals set by the CCDM in 1992 and adopted by the Comité International
    des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) the same year. The standard uncertainty (1 s) of the
    frequency of the He-Ne laser stabilized on the saturated absorption of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    at λ = 633 nm is reduced to a level of 12 kHz (2.5 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) when the
    lasers compared meet the recommended values of the parameters.</p><p>The lasers
    were first compared with the BIPMP3 laser, with all the lasers set to the parameter
    values normally used in each laboratory; the results then ranged from -10.1 kHz
    to +9.0 kHz. After checking and correcting the values of all the parameters, the
    range was reduced to -10.6 kHz to +2.6 kHz. Under the latter conditions, the average
    frequency difference of the group of lasers, with respect to the BIPM4 laser,
    was +0.3 kHz with a standard uncertainty (1 σ) of 5.3 kHz. The best relative frequency
    stabilities, with Allan standard deviations of about 6.2 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, 5.1
    × 10<sup>-13</sup> and 1.4 × 10<sup>-13</sup>, were observed with sampling times
    of 1 s, 100 s and 1000 s, respectively. The overall best value was 9.1 × 10<sup>-14</sup>
    for a sampling time of 10 000 s.</p>"
