abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of two different scales of regular reflectance measurements
    has been made between the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK) and the Consejo
    Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC, Spain). Both laboratories have
    spectrally calibrated a reflectance transfer standard at angles of incidence of
    8° and 45° in the wavelength range 350 nm to 1000 nm. Relative differences in
    reflectance are between 2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> and -2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>
    at 8°, and between 1 part in 10<sup>3</sup> and -4 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> at
    45°. These results agree well within their respective uncertainties.</p>"
