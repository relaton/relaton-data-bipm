  content: "<p>An international comparison of eight <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized
    semiconductor laser systems (DLs) has been carried out. Five of the DLs were extended-cavity
    lasers (ECLs) using extra-cavity saturation spectroscopy; another was a microlens-mounted
    diode modified to have weak optical feedback, stabilized using the same technique;
    the seventh ECL was stabilized using frequency-modulated spectroscopy. The final
    DL was a simple laser diode at 635 nm locked with a digital system on a linear
    absorption of iodine. The P(33) 6-3 transition of iodine was first used to compare
    the first seven DLs with a He-Ne laser stabilized on the R(127) 11-5 transition
    of iodine. The relative frequency stability of these lasers was between 5 parts
    in 10<sup>11</sup> and 7 parts in 10<sup>12</sup> for a sampling time of 1 s,
    with the best results less than 2 parts in 10<sup>13</sup> over 1000 s. The frequency
    repeatability measured during one week was of the order of a few tens of kilohertz.
    This large fluctuation was caused by poor adjustment of the electronic offset
    of two of the lasers. For the well-corrected lasers, the repeatability was within
    a few kilohertz. A study of stabilization on the strong absorption group of transitions
    R(60) 8-4, R(125) 9-4 and P(54) 8-4, located about -12 GHz from the R(127) 11-5
    transition, was also carried out. For the first time, a short-term frequency stability
    better than that of the classical He-Ne laser around 633 nm has been achieved
    with a relative frequency stability of 4 parts in 10<sup>12</sup> for 1 s.</p>"
