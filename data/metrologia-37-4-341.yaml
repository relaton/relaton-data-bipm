abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to evaluate the agreement between the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany) and the Ulusal Metroloji Enstitüsü (TÜBTAK-UME, Turkey)
    and to establish a firm basis for traceability, a bilateral comparison has been
    carried out using 1 Ω, 10 kΩ and 100 MΩ resistors. Measurements obtained by the
    PTB, based on their quantum Hall resistance standard (QHRS), differ from the UME
    results by 46 nΩ/Ω (standard uncertainty u = 0.19 µΩ/Ω) at the 1 Ω level, and
    by 3.0 nΩ/Ω (u = 0.25 µΩ/Ω) at the 10 kΩ level. The 100 MΩ resistors were compared
    using both a UME-constructed Wheatstone bridge and a commercial bridge. Measurement
    results obtained with the Wheatstone bridge show better agreement with those of
    the PTB, within 0.34 µΩ/Ω (u = 8.7 µΩ/Ω), than the results obtained with the commercial
    bridge, within 3.6 µΩ/Ω (u = 5.1 µΩ/Ω).</p>"
