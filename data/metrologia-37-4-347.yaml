  content: "<p>National reference standards for determining optical-fibre power maintained
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) and the All-Russian
    Research Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI, Russian Federation)
    were compared at wavelengths near 1300 nm and 1550 nm at a power level of 0.5
    mW. Instruments from both laboratories are based on thermal detectors capable
    of electrical calibration. The comparisons indicate relative differences of 2
    parts in 10<sup>3</sup> or less, which is easily within the combined uncertainty
    of the two laboratories.</p>"
