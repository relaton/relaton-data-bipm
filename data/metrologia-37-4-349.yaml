  content: "<p>We describe the results of a comparison of optical-power meters undertaken
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) and the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany) at nominal wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1550 nm. Both
    laboratories used thermal detectors as reference standards, which were compared
    using a germanium trap detector as a transfer standard. Measurement results showed
    differences of less than 1 part in 10<sup>3</sup>, well within the combined uncertainty
    for both laboratories.</p>"
