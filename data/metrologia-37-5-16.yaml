abstract:
- content: "<p>Atmospheric optical depths are determined by relating ground-based
    measurements of direct solar radiation to the extraterrestrial value, I<sub>0</sub>,
    that a filter radiometer would read outside the atmosphere. Usually I<sub>0</sub>
    is determined by the Langley extrapolation technique from a high-altitude site,
    where clear and highly stable atmospheric conditions may be found. Alternatively,
    I<sub>0</sub> can be measured in situ from a stratospheric balloon experiment.
    We have employed both methods and found agreement to better than 1 %. Filter radiometers
    tend to change over time, especially when used operationally outdoors. Absolute
    calibrations in the laboratory are used to monitor the radiometric stability of
    filter radiometers at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches Observatorium Davos (PMOD/WRC,
    Switzerland). A spectral calibration facility based on a calibrated trap detector
    from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany) is used to relate
    the filter radiometer to an accurate and long-term traceable standard. An FEL-lamp-based
    standard, previously used for several years, was compared with the new trap standard
    via a filter radiometer at four wavelengths between 368 nm and 862 nm and revealed
    a systematic difference of the order of 5 %. The link between radiometric and
    I<sub>0</sub> calibration is the value of the extraterrestrial solar spectrum
    at the filter radiometer wavelengths which can be determined from these two calibrations
    and compared with published values.</p>"
