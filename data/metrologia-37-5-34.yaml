abstract:
- content: "<p>The results are presented of absolute spectral responsivity measurements
    for SPPD11 and SPPD11-04 pulse-type silicon semiconductor detectors (developed
    by the Research Institute of Pulse Technique, Moscow), carried out over the X-ray
    energy range from 1.5 keV to 20 keV with a relative uncertainty (k = 1) of typically
    5 × 10<sup>−2</sup>. In our measurements, the detector is positioned in a calculable
    synchrotron radiation flux behind filters of well-known transmittance. The spectral
    responsivity of the detector is restored on the basis of measurement data using
    a set of integral equations. Two procedures have been developed to improve the
    calibration accuracy: one for the experimental determination of the X-ray transmittance
    near the K absorption edge of the filters used, with a relative uncertainty not
    exceeding 2 × 10<sup>−2</sup>; and another for the estimation of the angular spread
    of the electrons.</p>"
