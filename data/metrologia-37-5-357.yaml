  content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates
    the newly upgraded Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III) mainly
    as a light source for radiometry. SURF III provides continuum radiation from the
    far-infrared to the soft X-ray spectral range and has its peak output in the extreme
    ultraviolet. SURF III is a circular-orbit, weak-focusing (single dipole magnet)
    storage ring, a feature which is advantageous if the synchrotron radiation output
    is calculated. We report the improvements achieved during a recent upgrade from
    SURF II to SURF III and our strategy to accurately determine the magnetic flux
    density, radio frequency (RF), beam current, and beam size, which are the parameters
    necessary to characterize the source completely.</p>"
