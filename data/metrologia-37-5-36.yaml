abstract:
- content: "<p>Methods used for the establishment and dissemination of primary radiometric
    quantities are reviewed together with the performance and use of filter radiometers,
    which are dominating advances in optical radiation measurement. The possibility
    is also discussed of using many of these advances in other metrological sectors,
    such as in thermal metrology to improve the realization and dissemination of the
    kelvin.</p>"
