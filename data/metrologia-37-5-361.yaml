  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has installed an X-ray
    radiometry beamline at the new electron storage ring BESSY II. The synchrotron
    radiation is monochromatized by a four-crystal monochromator in the photon-energy
    range from 1.75 keV to 10 keV. The known radiant power, determined with a cryogenic
    electrical-substitution radiometer (ESR) as primary detector standard, is used
    for the calibration of detectors such as semiconductor photodiodes. Relative uncertainties
    of spectral responsivity well below 1 % have been achieved.</p>"
