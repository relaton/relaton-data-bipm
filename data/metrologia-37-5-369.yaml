  content: "<p>Recent work at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
    with superconducting transition thermometers suggests that substantial improvements
    could be achieved in the detection capability of electrical-substitution radiometers,
    which are widely used as the most accurate absolute standards of radiant flux
    and irradiance. Cambridge Research &amp; Instrumentation (CRI) has constructed
    liquid-nitrogen and liquid-helium-cooled prototype radiometers with responsivities
    of 550 mK/mW and 3.5 K/mW, and natural time constants of 30 s and 3 s, respectively.
    Our results with the liquid-nitrogen-cooled radiometer show that the high-<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub>
    superconductor YBCO sensor has similar detection capability to a germanium resistance
    thermometer operating at 4 K. In this prototype radiometer, we were able to control
    receiver temperature to better than 1 ÂµK and to attain a root-mean-square (rms)
    noise level of 1.6 nW. Our ongoing work focuses on the absolute accuracy achievable
    with such a liquid-nitrogen-cooled radiometer, using an optimized thermal design.
    The high detection sensitivity offered by the Nb sensor in the liquid-helium-cooled
    prototype radiometer achieved a temperature stability of 40 nK (rms), which implies
    a noise-equivalent power of 10 pW. Our measurements indicate that 1 pW should
    be feasible with optimized electronics, a lower-<italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub>
    sensor, and better control of heat-sink and scene drifts through implementation
    in the NIST Low Background Infrared (LBIR) chamber.</p>"
