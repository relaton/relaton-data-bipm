  content: "<p>High-temperature black bodies used as primary standards of spectral
    irradiance have to meet several requirements. One important demand is that the
    spectral irradiance of the black body is uniquely determined by Planck's radiation
    law, where the (radiometric) temperature of the black body is the only parameter
    that determines its relative spectral distribution. By combining determinations
    of the radiometric temperature of a black body over a wide temperature range with
    the corresponding spectral measurements, black-body spectra for different temperatures
    can be compared. This allows the use of self-consistency checks to ascertain whether
    (i) the temperature determinations are coherent over a wide temperature range;
    and (ii) the different spectral distributions show any deviation from Planck's
    law. Using this method of self-consistent calibrations, new absorption bands in
    the spectrum of a black body were discovered at very high temperatures. The level
    of absorption increases with temperature and depends on the operating conditions
    and imperfections of the black-body system. Possible origins of this effect are
    discussed and modifications proposed to avoid such absorption bands.</p>"
