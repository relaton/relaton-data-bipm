  content: "<p>Filter radiometers were used in a bilateral comparison of the radiometric
    temperatures of a high-temperature black body from 2100 K to 3100 K. The measurements
    took place over a ten-day period in October 1998 at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany) using filter radiometers from the PTB
    and from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg,
    USA). The comparison revealed that the radiometric temperatures determined using
    the NIST and the PTB filter radiometers differed progressively from 2.4 K at 2200
    K to 5.1 K at 3200 K, with the NIST temperature values always lower than the PTB
    values. Differences in the measurements of absolute spectral responsivity were
    the main cause of the observed temperature differences.</p>"
