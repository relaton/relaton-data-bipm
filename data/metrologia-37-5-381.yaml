  content: "<p>Correlated colour temperature (CCT) of a source is estimated from position
    in CIE 1960 (<italic>u</italic>, <italic>v</italic>) colour space in relation
    to the black-body locus. In this paper, the methods of the ISO <italic>Guide to
    the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> are applied to derive analytical
    expressions for uncertainty in <italic>u</italic> and <italic>v</italic> chromacity
    coordinates and CCT, including correlation effects. Uncertainty in CCT is found
    by fitting the form of the black-body locus and relevant derivatives. Examples
    are given for calibration of four typical sources of spectral distributions. Accurate
    CCT is determined by a search technique. An alternative method using fitted functions
    to solve for CCT using the geometry in (<italic>u</italic>, <italic>v</italic>)
    space is presented. An uncertainty in CCT of a few kelvin can be achieved.</p>"
