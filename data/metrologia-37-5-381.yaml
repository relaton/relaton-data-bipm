abstract:
- content: "<p>Correlated colour temperature (CCT) of a source is estimated from position
    in CIE 1960 (u, v) colour space in relation to the black-body locus. In this paper,
    the methods of the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement are
    applied to derive analytical expressions for uncertainty in u and v chromacity
    coordinates and CCT, including correlation effects. Uncertainty in CCT is found
    by fitting the form of the black-body locus and relevant derivatives. Examples
    are given for calibration of four typical sources of spectral distributions. Accurate
    CCT is determined by a search technique. An alternative method using fitted functions
    to solve for CCT using the geometry in (u, v) space is presented. An uncertainty
    in CCT of a few kelvin can be achieved.</p>"
