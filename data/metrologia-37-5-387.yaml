  content: "<p>A complete set of total solar irradiance measurements from space is
    available dating from November 1978, yielding a time series of more than twenty
    years. From measurements made by different space radiometers (HF on NIMBUS-7,
    ACRIM I on SMM, ACRIM II on UARS and VIRGO on SOHO) a composite record of solar
    total irradiance can be compiled. The corrections needed for each radiometer,
    mainly to compensate for degradation, are based on a detailed study of the behaviour
    of the VIRGO (Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations) radiometers.
    Moreover, several errors arising from operational changes or interruptions, which
    influence the overall uncertainty more than corrections for degradation, have
    to be corrected. A composite of the corrected time series is constructed in order
    to estimate the long-term stability, which is much better than the estimated 1
    part in 10<sup>5</sup> per annum deduced as an upper limit from VIRGO radiometry.
    The absolute accuracy of the data, however, is more difficult to estimate.</p>"
