abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the beginning of 1996, the vacuum-ultraviolet telescope and spectrograph
    SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurements of Emitted Radiation) on the Solar and Heliospheric
    Observatory (SOHO) of ESA and NASA, has obtained radiance spectra of many features
    of the quiescent and active Sun with high spectral and spatial resolutions. Irradiance
    measurements of line emissions have also been performed in the wavelength range
    58.4 nm to 154.8 nm. The instrument was calibrated against the electron storage
    ring BESSY I as a primary source standard with the help of a transfer source standard
    based on a hollow-cathode discharge lamp. A thorough cleanliness programme, specifically
    aimed at chemical contamination control, resulted in an excellent radiometric
    stability of the normal-incidence optical system as well as of the detectors.
    This was verified under operational conditions by various techniques employed
    during the SOHO mission, such as line-ratio studies, star observations and comparisons
    with other instruments. The observations provide vacuum-ultraviolet radiometry
    of the Sun in many emission lines of atoms and ions with a relative uncertainty
    of 0.15 (1 σ) for the wavelength range 54 nm to 125 nm.</p>"
