abstract:
- content: "<p>Uncertainty in terrestrial solar radiation measurements of a few watts
    per square metre (1 W/m<sup>2</sup> to 2 W/m<sup>2</sup>) is needed to validate
    estimates of the Earth's radiation balance derived from satellite data. The characterization
    of solar energy resources for renewable energy technologies requires similar accuracy
    for economical technology deployment. Solar radiation measurement research at
    the National Renewable Energy Laboratory addresses calibrations, operational characteristics,
    and corrections for terrestrial solar radiation measurements. The characterization
    of field instrument geometric and thermal responses contributing to radiometric
    errors is described, together with correction schemes reducing the uncertainty
    of broadband irradiance measurements from tens of watts per square metre to a
    few (±2 W/m<sup>2</sup> to ±5 W/m<sup>2</sup>). Such improvements in accuracy
    reduce the time and labour required for detecting and quantifying trends in terrestrial
    solar radiation and possible changes in the Earth's radiation budget.</p>"
