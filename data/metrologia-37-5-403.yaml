abstract:
- content: "<p>The lack of accurate calibration sources is preventing current sensor
    technology from achieving the minimum possible uncertainty levels in remote-sensing
    radiometric measurements. This has been established in a recent study undertaken
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) following the identification
    of the problem at the Calibration Source Requirements Workshop at the NIST in
    1997. This paper presents the concept of establishing high-accuracy calibration
    sources in space, utilizing the International Space Station (ISS) as a platform.
    For example, a retrievable total solar irradiance radiometer standard could be
    deployed on the ISS in order to establish the Sun as a calibration source of the
    required accuracy. Periodic measurements of solar irradiance with this radiometer
    standard would help to establish the Sun as a radiometric standard with the accuracy
    needed for various radiometric sensors on other platforms in space. As the radiometer
    on the ISS would be retrievable, its traceability to the International System
    of Units (SI) could be maintained by periodically bringing it down for calibration
    with SI-traceable standards maintained in ground laboratories. Other suitable
    radiometric standards on the ISS could also establish the Moon, the stars and
    various ground sites as calibration sources.</p>"
