abstract:
- content: <p>The Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM), an active-cavity solar radiometer,
    is to be launched in 2002 on the SORCE mission of the Earth Observing System (EOS).
    The relative uncertainty (1 σ) will be better than 10<sup>−4</sup>, i.e. 100 parts
    per million (ppm) (1 σ) with a noise level of &lt; 1 ppm each 500 s. Sunlight
    passes through a shutter, a 50 mm<sup>2</sup> aperture, and is then absorbed into
    a silver cavity blackened inside with nickel phosphorus. High thermal-conductivity
    diamond insulators at the electrical terminals help to localize thermal nodes.
    Four cavities are aligned side-by-side at the rear of a 2 kg heat sink. The flight
    "standard digital watt" is derived from a high-precision voltage and a pulse-width-modulator;
    this eliminates the need for a square root in the servo loop. We determine the
    irradiance from the in-phase sinusoidal component at the shutter frequency. This
    phase-sensitive detection allows more accurate characterization than traditional
    time-domain methods. We calibrate the aperture transmission integral over area
    against a chrome-on-quartz ruling, transferring by charge-coupled device (CCD)
    images. In flight, we recalibrate the servo-loop gain, pointing variations, and
    dark signal. We determine the equivalence ratio from models and by laser measurements
    of the cavity parameters.</p>
