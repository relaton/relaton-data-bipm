abstract:
- content: "<p>A spectral radiance responsivity (SRR) scale derived from the spectral
    irradiance responsivity scale has been realized on the newly developed NIST facility
    for Spectral Irradiance and Radiance Responsivity Calibrations with Uniform Sources
    (SIRCUS). The scales were directly derived from the primary standard cryogenic
    radiometer using transfer standard irradiance trap detectors and laser-based uniform
    sources. Silicon radiance meters of standards quality have been developed to hold
    the SRR scale. The radiance meters were characterized and optimized for size-of-source
    effects. The optimized meters were calibrated for SRR against the monochromatic
    uniform source. In addition to the SIRCUS calibrations, preliminary tests were
    also made on the Spectral Comparator Facility (SCF) of the NIST. These relative
    SRR tests were made in both imaging and non-imaging measurement modes. The results
    of the different SRR calibrations are compared and evaluated.</p>"
