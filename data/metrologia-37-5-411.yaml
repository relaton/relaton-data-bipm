  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A general modelling formalism is used to extend near-field point spread
    function (PSF) measurements over a wide-field off-axis angular range, covering
    a dynamic range of 5 to 6 orders of magnitude, using bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) measurements of the scan mirror and other key optical
    elements. Line spread function (LSF) model results were compared with measured
    near-field LSF measurements for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) of the Earth Observing System (EOS), demonstrating excellent agreement
    between model and measurements. When realistic effects of sensor scattered light
    are taken into account, significant radiometric bias errors are produced near
    high-contrast structured scenes (e.g. bright clouds over dark oceans and land;
    broken snow and ice scenes). Image restoration using an asymptotically exact PSF
    is shown to produce results significantly different from those produced by traditional
    near-field 5 × 5, 7 × 7, ..., PSF kernel matrix inversion techniques. The results
    reported have implications for future remote-sensor specifications and testing,
    in-flight and surface-based calibration comparisons, and the assessment of radiometric
    bias errors in the presence of moderate- to high-contrast Earth scenes.</p>"
