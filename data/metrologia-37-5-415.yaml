  content: "<p>The Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM) will measure the solar spectral
    irradiance between 0.2 µm to 2.0 µm to a relative standard uncertainty of 3 ×
    10<sup>−4</sup> (1 s) and with a noise level of &lt;1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. The instrument
    will be launched in 2002 on the SORCE mission of the Earth Observing System (EOS).
    Sunlight passes through a 0.3 mm × 7 mm entrance slit and is modulated by a shutter
    at 0.1 Hz. Light then travels 400 mm to a Fery prism that disperses and focuses
    the light at the focal plane containing five separate exit slits, with an electrical-substitution
    radiometer (ESR) and four photodiode detectors. The ESR consists of two back-to-back
    1 mm × 10 mm diamond bolometers blackened with nickel phosphorus. The bolometer
    bridge, electrical power replacement, ESR temperature regulation, and prism rotation
    are under digital signal processor control. The measurement equation and the uncertainty
    budget for the SIM instrument are presented along with plans for the pre-flight
    characterization of the instrument.</p>"
