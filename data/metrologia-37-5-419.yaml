  content: "<p>Atmospheric optical depths are determined by relating ground-based
    measurements of direct solar radiation to the extraterrestrial value, <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>,
    that a filter radiometer would read outside the atmosphere. Usually <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>
    is determined by the Langley extrapolation technique from a high-altitude site,
    where clear and highly stable atmospheric conditions may be found. Alternatively,
    <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> can be measured <italic>in situ</italic> from a
    stratospheric balloon experiment. We have employed both methods and found agreement
    to better than 1 %. Filter radiometers tend to change over time, especially when
    used operationally outdoors. Absolute calibrations in the laboratory are used
    to monitor the radiometric stability of filter radiometers at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches
    Observatorium Davos (PMOD/WRC, Switzerland). A spectral calibration facility based
    on a calibrated trap detector from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB,
    Germany) is used to relate the filter radiometer to an accurate and long-term
    traceable standard. An FEL-lamp-based standard, previously used for several years,
    was compared with the new trap standard via a filter radiometer at four wavelengths
    between 368 nm and 862 nm and revealed a systematic difference of the order of
    5 %. The link between radiometric and <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub> calibration
    is the value of the extraterrestrial solar spectrum at the filter radiometer wavelengths
    which can be determined from these two calibrations and compared with published
    values.</p>"
