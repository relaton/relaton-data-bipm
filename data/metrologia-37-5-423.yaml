abstract:
- content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), with the
    support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has built
    several transfer radiometers that are used in radiometric measurement comparisons
    to validate spectral-radiance levels assigned to integrating-sphere sources by
    the end user. The transfer radiometers are characterized and calibrated at the
    NIST, and function as direct links in the spectralradiance measurement chain.
    This paper presents a historical analysis of a calibration method that utilizes
    a broadband source. Previously observed discrepancies between two radiometers
    are reconciled as a result.</p>"
