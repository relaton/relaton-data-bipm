abstract:
- content: "<p>An electrically substituted bolometer (ESB) has been developed at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to serve as a portable transfer-standard
    detector over the wavelength range 200 nm to 20 µm. The ESB is designed to provide
    a direct transfer of the optical power scale from the NIST High Accuracy Cryogenic
    Radiometer (HACR) to the NIST spectral-comparator facilities in the infrared region,
    where silicon-photodiode trap detectors cannot be used and where the noise of
    pyroelectric detectors currently limits the uncertainty. The noise floor of the
    8 mm diameter active-area ESB approaches 10 pW/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> at 15 Hz, corresponding
    to a detectivity of the order of 10<sup>11</sup> cm Hz<sup>1/2</sup>/W. This is
    an improvement by a factor of almost 1000 on that attainable from a similar-sized
    room-temperature electrically calibrated pyroelectric radiometer (ECPR). The ESB
    is linear from the noise floor to 1 mW (the power range of the HACR), whereas
    previous helium-cooled bolometers developed at the NIST have a similar noise floor
    but are non-linear above about 10 µW and so cannot be directly calibrated against
    the HACR. Because of its low noise, linearity over a wide dynamic range, and the
    spectral and spatial flatness of its response, the ESB is finding other applications
    beyond that which motivated its development.</p>"
