abstract:
- content: "<p>Cryogenic radiometers are widely used as national primary standards
    for radiometric and photometric measurements. The most common comparisons are
    indirect, using various types of trap detector. The lowest limit of relative uncertainty
    achievable by indirect comparisons is not much less than 2 × 10<sup>−4</sup> (k
    = 1). To improve this level of uncertainty, it is necessary to compare the cryogenic
    radiometers directly at the same position using an identical beam. In this case
    error sources such as beam size, beam power and scatter are significantly reduced.
    The comparison between the mechanically-cooled cryogenic radiometer (MCR) of the
    National Physical Laboratory (NPL), and the liquid-helium-cooled radiometer (LaseRad
    II) of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), was the fourth in a series
    of direct comparisons worldwide. It took place in the best environment presently
    available, at the transfer-optimized cryogenic radiometer in the class 1000 clean-room
    centre at the PTB in Braunschweig (class 100 is available). The two radiometers
    were sequentially positioned by a translation stage in the power-stabilized laser
    beam. In four different series of measurements, within two weeks, the average
    stated relative difference of the measurements of radiant power with these two
    very different cryogenic radiometers was only 3.2 × 10<sup>5</sup>, which is currently
    the lowest obtained in a radiometric comparison of absolute scales.</p>"
