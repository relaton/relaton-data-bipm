abstract:
- content: "<p>The spectral irradiance of lamp standards can be stabilized within
    a limited spectral range using a suitable selective detector to control the irradiance
    of the lamps. The capability of one commercial lamp facility incorporating a computer-controlled
    power supply was tested in an international comparison. A set of three lamps and
    the detector-stabilized power supply were circulated between the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany), the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT, Finland)
    and the Swedish National Testing and Research Institute (SP, Sweden) for the comparison,
    EUROMET project No. 475.</p>"
