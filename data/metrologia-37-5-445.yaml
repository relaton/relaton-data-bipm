  content: "<p>We report the results of the first laser high-power measurement comparison
    between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany), and the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). Laser power transfer standards
    were calibrated at both national standards laboratories between 82 W and 127 W
    at 1.06 µm and between 85 W and 554 W at 10.6 µm. Relative agreement between the
    standards of the two laboratories was demonstrated to lie between 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>
    and 7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, which is well within the combined uncertainties.</p>"
