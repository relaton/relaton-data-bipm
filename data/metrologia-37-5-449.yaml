  content: "<p>This paper presents the results of investigations of the spectral responsivity
    in terms of radiant power within the infrared spectral range. Large-sized InGaAs
    photodiodes of 10 mm × 10 mm and an InGaAs trap detector were studied within the
    spectral range 500 nm to 1900 nm. The spectral responsivity of this reflection
    trap detector with three photodiodes is compared with that of a single InGaAs
    photodiode (photodiodes all of the same type). The temperature effect on the spectral
    responsivity is measured within the temperature range 10 °C to 30 °C. The results,
    which are important for calibration of transfer standards for optical communication,
    are discussed in terms of spectral quantum efficiency.</p>"
