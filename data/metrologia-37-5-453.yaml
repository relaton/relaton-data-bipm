abstract:
- content: <p>The performance of spectral irradiance transfer-standard lamps has long
    been a concern in the radiometry and photometry communities. The adoption of a
    modified FEL-type lamp has recently been proposed as the most suitable transfer
    standard for spectral irradiance measurements. While data have been published
    on the performance of these lamps when operated continuously and in a laboratory
    environment, however, little information is available on their performance under
    typical usage. The results are presented of "real-life" testing of over thirty
    FEL lamps both pre-selected, according to published procedures, and direct from
    the manufacturer. When operated vertically all of the lamps tested suffered terminal
    coil collapse after between 140 h and 250 h burn time. The reproducibility of
    the FEL lamps after transportation is also investigated.</p>
