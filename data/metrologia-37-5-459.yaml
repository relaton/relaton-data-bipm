  content: <p>Charge-coupled-device (CCD) video cameras have become very important
    tools in the field of "image science", not only for their good performance as
    optical cameras but also for their ability to obtain radiometric readings of pixels.
    This paper reviews calibration procedures for these cameras, concentrating on
    the radiometric rather than other optical aspects, and proposes new calibration
    methods as a way of reducing the uncertainty of measurements made with these cameras.</p>
