abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on experience acquired over many years in operating high-power,
    stationary arc plasmas for quantitative spectroscopy, the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) has begun to investigate the suitability of argon arc-plasma
    radiation for radiometry. We have demonstrated, through the design and operational
    control of the arc source, that for example argon plasma generated at 150 A and
    a pressure of 200 kPa provides radiation with a stability of about 10<sup>−3</sup>.
    We also state a long-term reproducibility of better than 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> because
    all operational and geometrical parameters affecting the plasma radiation can
    be controlled with a relative uncertainty of at least 10<sup>−3</sup>. The radiation
    properties have been investigated and carefully characterized in the wavelength
    range 250 nm to 10 µm at the new PTB detector-calibration facility.</p>"
