  content: "<p>The Scanner for Radiation Budget (ScaRaB) instruments are a series
    of Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) radiometers of which the first flight model (FM1)
    was launched on a Russian METEOR satellite in 1993. A second model (FM2) was launched
    on the Russian RESURS satellite in July 1998. The FM2 instrument worked perfectly
    until the failure of the platform transmitter in April 1999. Considering both
    missions, ERB data were obtained over sixteen months with ScaRaB. In order to
    obtain a good correlation between calibrations on the ground and in space in the
    long-wave spectral domain, the spectral response has been re-estimated using an
    original method. As the solar ground calibration and the integrating-sphere calibration
    are conducted in an enclosure purged with dry nitrogen, the detector gain differs
    from the gain under vacuum, and a correction factor must be applied. A new correction
    coefficient has been determined through analysis of the ScaRaB data sets, leading
    to satisfactory agreement between long-wave vacuum calibration and solar calibration.</p>"
