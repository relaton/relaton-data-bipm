abstract:
- content: "<p>The design of a new detector-stabilized spectral irradiance source
    is presented, together with an evaluation of its performance. This new source
    consists of a tungsten-halogen lamp that is current-controlled using feedback
    from an array of filtered photodiodes. The bandpass and central wavelength of
    these filtered detectors may be selected specifically to meet the required application
    of the source. The lamp is fully enclosed (except for the exit aperture) in an
    air-cooled, light-tight housing that minimizes unwanted light pollution. The lamp
    current is stabilized using feedback from one photodiode; the recording of the
    non-stabilization channels allows a real-time check on the effective colour temperature
    of the lamp, and provides an instant diagnosis of the state of calibration of
    the lamp. The calibration data for each lamp (in its associated housing) are stored
    on a microchip within the lamp housing, which allows the lamp to be transported
    independently of its associated control electronics for calibration purposes.
    The performance of the lamp indicates ageing rates of better than 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
    h<sup>−1</sup>, across the ultraviolet-A (UV-A) and visible spectral regions.</p>"
