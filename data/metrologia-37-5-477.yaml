abstract:
- content: "<p>We have designed and evaluated an optical trap detector that is simple
    to fabricate and convenient to use. The trap geometry is a triangular tube similar
    to a kaleidoscope, with two photodiodes in place of a mirror on each side. One
    version incorporates six 10 mm × 10 mm silicon photodiodes in a detector having
    a 7 mm diameter aperture. Spectral responsivity measurement results indicate that
    the quantum efficiency, evaluated at 10 nm increments from 450 nm to 950 nm, is
    greater than 99 %. Another version incorporates six 18 mm × 18 mm silicon photodiodes
    in a detector having a 12 mm diameter aperture. Spectral responsivity measurement
    results from this instrument are similar to those from the other one, but the
    quantum efficiency is lower. Spatial uniformity measurement results for the larger
    detector indicate that, over the 12 mm diameter area, response variations are
    less than 0.05 %. We have evaluated several fields-of-view and confirmed that,
    in a special case, the detector geometry will accommodate an input beam having
    a divergence as large as 14°. Design considerations are briefly described and
    may be used to create similar, scaled versions with other photodiode types and
    sizes.</p>"
