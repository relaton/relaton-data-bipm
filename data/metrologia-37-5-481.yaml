abstract:
- content: "<p>The spatial non-uniformity of a newly developed electrically calibrated
    radiometer system is characterized. The detector is a thin-film thermopile with
    an integral electrical heater. This paper shows that the local responsivities
    of these detectors have a rotational symmetry and a quadratic dependence on the
    distance to the centre of the detector. Typical measurement errors, which can
    be caused by applying different beam sizes, different power distributions of the
    beams, and different beam positions impinging on the detector, are investigated.
    A significant reduction of measurement uncertainties is achieved using specific
    corrections. The influence of spatial non-uniformity on responsivity measurements
    is experimentally checked with various types of beam.</p>"
