abstract:
- content: "<p>The quantum efficiency, η, of gold and copper photocathodes has been
    measured in the photon-energy range from 50 eV to 10 keV. The experiments were
    performed with monochromatized synchrotron radiation at the radiometry laboratories
    of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage rings
    BESSY I and BESSY II. Relative standard uncertainties of η lower than 0.036 were
    achieved using a cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometer as the primary detector
    standard. The samples were cleaned, stored and examined in an ultra-high-vacuum
    chamber. The quantum efficiency of cleaned gold and copper was found to be reproducible
    within 2 parts in 10<sup>2</sup> to 3 parts in 10<sup>2</sup>. A simple model
    assumes to be proportional to the product of absorption coefficient, μ, and photon
    energy, hν. The relative course of the absorption coefficient was also measured
    with relative standard uncertainties below 0.04. As proportionality was only locally
    fulfilled, a more sophisticated model for quantum efficiency was developed.</p>"
