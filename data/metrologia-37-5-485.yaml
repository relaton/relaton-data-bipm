  content: "<p>The quantum efficiency, η, of gold and copper photocathodes has been
    measured in the photon-energy range from 50 eV to 10 keV. The experiments were
    performed with monochromatized synchrotron radiation at the radiometry laboratories
    of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage rings
    BESSY I and BESSY II. Relative standard uncertainties of η lower than 0.036 were
    achieved using a cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometer as the primary detector
    standard. The samples were cleaned, stored and examined in an ultra-high-vacuum
    chamber. The quantum efficiency of cleaned gold and copper was found to be reproducible
    within 2 parts in 10<sup>2</sup> to 3 parts in 10<sup>2</sup>. A simple model
    assumes to be proportional to the product of absorption coefficient, μ, and photon
    energy, <italic>h</italic>ν. The relative course of the absorption coefficient
    was also measured with relative standard uncertainties below 0.04. As proportionality
    was only locally fulfilled, a more sophisticated model for quantum efficiency
    was developed.</p>"
