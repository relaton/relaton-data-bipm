  content: "<p>Changes in beam geometry during the calibration and subsequent testing
    of optical detector standards can cause errors which appear as uncertainties in
    the responsivities of the detectors. These uncertainties, caused by non-ideal
    detector input characteristics and changes in input beam geometry, can be decreased
    significantly if the detector response is always corrected to a reference beam
    geometry such as a collimated beam normally incident on the detector surface.
    An integral directional error can be determined for radiant power, luminous flux,
    irradiance and illuminance detectors by calculating the weighted integral of the
    product of the measured source radiance and the directional error over the solid
    angle produced by the light source. A conical directional error is introduced,
    and used to describe the case of circular and uniform radiant sources (e.g. exit
    port of an integrating sphere) and circularly symmetric detectors. An evaluation
    is presented of the conical directional error, a directional response correction
    factor, the results of directional response measurements, and directional response
    correction factors for some practical standard detectors (such as diffuser-input
    InGaAs and integrating-sphere-input silicon irradiance meters, silicon photodiodes,
    and pyroelectric radiant power and irradiance measuring detectors).</p>"
