  content: "<p>A theoretical model, whose validity was confirmed experimentally, has
    been used to investigate the polarization properties of silicon photodiodes as
    functions of the angle of incidence with wavelengths ranging from 10 nm to 800
    nm. From this, spectral differences in the responses of silicon photodiodes between
    a collimated beam and a beam with angle divergence are derived. The calculation
    shows that divergent beams (both isotropic and Gaussian beams) usually give lower
    responses than those for a collimated beam except in a limited spectral region
    (approximately 120 nm to 220 nm for a Si photodiode coated with a SiO<sub>2</sub>
    layer of thickness 27 nm). The decrease in response of the Si photodiode with
    27 nm SiO<sub>2</sub> for the isotropic divergent beam with half apex angle of
    the beam cone of 60Â° reaches a maximum of 14 % at a wavelength of 44 nm and the
    increase reaches a maximum of 7.5 % at 163 nm. Similar results for a Si photodiode
    coated with an 8 nm oxide layer and a divergent beam with Gaussian angular distribution
    were also obtained.</p>"
