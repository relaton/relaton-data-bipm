  content: "<p>The results are presented of absolute spectral responsivity measurements
    for SPPD11 and SPPD11-04 pulse-type silicon semiconductor detectors (developed
    by the Research Institute of Pulse Technique, Moscow), carried out over the X-ray
    energy range from 1.5 keV to 20 keV with a relative uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>
    = 1) of typically 5 × 10<sup>−2</sup>. In our measurements, the detector is positioned
    in a calculable synchrotron radiation flux behind filters of well-known transmittance.
    The spectral responsivity of the detector is restored on the basis of measurement
    data using a set of integral equations. Two procedures have been developed to
    improve the calibration accuracy: one for the experimental determination of the
    X-ray transmittance near the K absorption edge of the filters used, with a relative
    uncertainty not exceeding 2 × 10<sup>−2</sup>; and another for the estimation
    of the angular spread of the electrons.</p>"
