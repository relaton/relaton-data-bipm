abstract:
- content: "<p>A new ultra-high-temperature black body designed and constructed at
    the All-Russian Research Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI, Russian
    Federation) has recently been delivered to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL,
    UK). The black-body cavity consists of a series of pyrolytic-graphite rings and
    is designed to operate at temperatures of up to 3500 K. Preliminary results show
    that the cavity uniformity varies with operating temperature and change in shape
    of cavity bottom. Results of active and passive temperature control are also given.</p>"
