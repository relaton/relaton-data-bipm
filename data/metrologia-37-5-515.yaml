  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has established spectral
    responsivity standards for photodetectors in the wavelength range between 200
    nm and 400 nm based on cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometers. In order
    to obtain standards over a continuous wavelength range with low uncertainty, combined
    use is made of both the dispersed synchrotron radiation of the storage ring BESSY
    I and quasi-monochromatic laser radiation. Taking advantage of the specific properties
    of the monochromatized synchrotron radiation and the laser radiation, relative
    standard uncertainties between 10<sup>−3</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> are achieved
    in the calibration of trap detectors in the spectral range 400 nm to 200 nm.</p>"
