  content: "<p>An experimental set-up designed for the calibration of near-infrared
    detectors against a cryogenic radiometer, using a tuneable laser diode as source,
    is described. A complete characterization of the cryogenic radiometer has been
    performed at the Instituto de Fisica Aplicada (IFA, Madrid), at wavelengths of
    1300 nm and 1550 nm. Two different secondary standards, an electrically calibrated
    pyroelectric radiometer and an InGaAs-based integrating-sphere radiometer, have
    been calibrated with relative uncertainties of less than 10<sup>−3</sup> at these
    wavelengths.</p>"
