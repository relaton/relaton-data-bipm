abstract:
- content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has developed a spectral
    responsivity scale in the spectral range 0.95 µm to 1.6 µm. The responsivity scale
    was established by calibrating InGaAs photodiodes against the PTB radiation thermometry
    cryogenic radiometer (RTCR) using several laser sources: a Ti:sapphire laser (0.850
    µm to 1.02 µm); a Nd:YAG laser (1.064 µm); and two diode lasers (1.31 µm, 1.55
    µm). At intermediate wavelengths the responsivity was interpolated with the help
    of thermal cavity detectors of high emissivity. In this way the high accuracy
    of the scale at the laser wavelengths can be maintained over almost the entire
    spectral region. A detailed discussion is given of the uncertainties achieved
    in the calibration with the RTCR and the interpolation with the thermal detector.</p>"
