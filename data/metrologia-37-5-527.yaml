  content: "<p>Realizations of the units of luminance and spectral radiance at the
    Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) are presented. These realizations are
    linked to HUT units of luminous intensity and spectral irradiance using a characterized
    photometer, a spectroradiometer and an integrating-sphere light source. A new
    method for determining the spatial uniformity of the output of the integrating-sphere
    source is described. The uncertainty analysis indicates a relative expanded uncertainty
    of 3.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup> (coverage factor <italic>k</italic> = 2) for the realization
    of the unit of luminance. The expanded uncertainty for the realization of the
    unit of spectral radiance varies between 6 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and 2.5 × 10<sup>−2</sup>
    in the wavelength region 360 nm to 830 nm.</p>"
