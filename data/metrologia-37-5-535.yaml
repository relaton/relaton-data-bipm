  content: "<p>The spectral radiance of a black body can be calculated from Planck's
    radiation law when the black-body temperature is known. Therefore, the spectral
    radiance of a black-body radiator of accurately known temperature may be used
    as a reference for the establishment of a spectral radiance scale. In this paper
    we investigate the feasibility of using a copper-freezing-point (1357.77 K) black-body
    radiator to directly calibrate gas-filled tungsten strip-filament lamps operating
    at a radiance temperature of 2300 K (at 650 nm). A silicon photodetector with
    a variable-gain amplifier, as well as optical apertures of different sizes, were
    used to measure the large radiance ratios observed. The comparison was performed
    at eight wavelengths between 400 nm and 900 nm using interference filters. The
    major problem encountered was out-of-passband infrared (IR) leakage of the interference
    filters, particularly those below 550 nm. We discuss the use of sharp-cut glass
    filters to correct the IR leakage of the filters.</p>"
