  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has developed a spectral
    comparator facility for accurate spectral radiance measurements. As a primary
    standard source, a high-temperature black body (HTBB) is operated in the temperature
    range 1500 K to 3200 K. The black-body temperature is determined by two methods:
    monochromatic radiation thermometry relative to the freezing point of gold; and
    absolute radiometry with filter radiometers calibrated against a cryogenic radiometer.
    For these purposes, the HTBB is operated in radiance and irradiance modes at the
    same time. This paper presents an uncertainty analysis of the new spectral radiance
    scale embodied by gas-filled tungsten strip lamps from 220 nm to 2500 nm. Such
    lamps are currently used as transfer standards for the Consultative Committee
    for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) comparison of spectral radiance (CCPR-S1).</p>"
