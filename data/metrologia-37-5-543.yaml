  content: "<p>In 1991, the last international comparison of spectral responsivity
    with germanium detectors showed relative differences between national laboratories
    of up to 10<sup>−2</sup> at wavelengths of 1300 nm and 1550 nm. The 1997 EUROMET
    international comparison of optical-fibre power meters showed relative differences
    between European laboratories of 10<sup>−2</sup>. The coincidence of the results
    from the two comparisons suggests that the radiometric standards used by these
    laboratories in the calibration of their power meters are the main cause of such
    differences, rather than the optical-fibre or transfer devices used in the comparisons.
    To test this assumption, three different electrical-substitution radiometers (ESRs),
    working at room temperature and used at the same wavelengths as radiometric standards
    in optical-fibre laboratories, were compared. The radiometers were an optical
    calorimeter, a pyroelectric radiometer and a thermopile. The relative differences
    obtained were within 5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.</p>"
