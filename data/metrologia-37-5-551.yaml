  content: "<p>The completion of the upgrade of the synchrotron facilities at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has yielded a better characterized
    broadband source of ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the Synchrotron Ultraviolet
    Radiation Facility (SURF III). A cryogenic-radiometer-based facility that uses
    the monochromatized radiation from SURF III has been established on beamline 4
    (BL-4) to characterize detectors and optical materials in the wavelength range
    125 nm to 325 nm. This upgraded cryogenic radiometry facility will be used to
    measure the spectral responsivity of detectors in the UV with a relative standard
    uncertainty of less than 10<sup>âˆ’2</sup>. To demonstrate the capability of BL-4,
    we have performed a transmittance measurement of calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>).
    Accurate transmittance measurements of optical materials in the UV are urgently
    needed to evaluate which materials are the best choices for use in making lenses
    for UV lithography. A study of CaF<sub>2</sub> in spectral transmittance, surface
    scattering, and surface absorption is presented.</p>"
