  content: "<p>A facility has been designed to perform a variety of detector characterizations
    in the air-ultraviolet in the spectral range 230 nm to 400 nm. The facility allows
    the measurement of spatial uniformity, linearity and the spectral responsivity
    of different detectors, irradiated by a He-Cd laser or by a monochromator and
    Xe discharge lamp. With this technique, a set of Si photodiodes, Si detectors
    in trap configuration, and ultraviolet (UV) radiometers built with SiC detectors
    in an integrating sphere, have been calibrated and their absolute responsivity
    at the He-Cd laser UV line has been determined with respect to an absolute cryogenic
    radiometer.</p>"
