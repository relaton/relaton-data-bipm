abstract:
- content: "<p>The effects on the calibration uncertainties of industrial ultraviolet
    radiometers of spatial non-uniformity in the irradiance beam and detector response
    are studied both theoretically and experimentally. The results show that an error
    of a few parts in 10<sup>2</sup> or more could easily arise from the non-uniformity
    of the beam used in calibration if the effective receiving area of the test meter
    head differs significantly from that of a standard meter head. This error can
    be removed effectively by an area-correction technique based on a charge-coupled-device
    (CCD) camera.</p>"
