  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) operates a unique beam
    line for the radiometric calibration of ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum-ultraviolet
    (VUV) radiation sources by direct comparison of their unknown spectral radiant
    flux with the calculable spectral radiant flux of the electron storage ring BESSY
    I in the spectral range 40 nm to 400 nm. At this beam line the relative standard
    uncertainty of the calculated spectral radiant flux of the synchrotron radiation
    is <italic>u</italic> = 3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and it allows the calibration of the
    spectral radiance of deuterium lamps with a relative standard uncertainty of 2.5
    × 10<sup>−2</sup> above 165 nm. The high-accuracy beam line is now complemented
    by new instrumentation specially designed for the dissemination of the spectral
    radiance and radiant intensity scale using deuterium lamps as transfer source
    standards. This instrumentation allows the calibration of radiation sources in
    the 115 nm to 400 nm spectral range without significant loss in accuracy and the
    measurement of spectrally and spatially resolved radiance profiles such as to
    image the plasma topography of the discharge. The new instrumentation is described.
    Results for the radiometric long-term stability of selected deuterium lamps are
    shown. The radiance and radiant intensity as well as the radiance profile of different
    types of commercially available deuterium lamp are presented.</p>"
