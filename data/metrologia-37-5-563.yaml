abstract:
- content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) operates a unique beam
    line for the radiometric calibration of ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum-ultraviolet
    (VUV) radiation sources by direct comparison of their unknown spectral radiant
    flux with the calculable spectral radiant flux of the electron storage ring BESSY
    I in the spectral range 40 nm to 400 nm. At this beam line the relative standard
    uncertainty of the calculated spectral radiant flux of the synchrotron radiation
    is u = 3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> and it allows the calibration of the spectral radiance
    of deuterium lamps with a relative standard uncertainty of 2.5 × 10<sup>−2</sup>
    above 165 nm. The high-accuracy beam line is now complemented by new instrumentation
    specially designed for the dissemination of the spectral radiance and radiant
    intensity scale using deuterium lamps as transfer source standards. This instrumentation
    allows the calibration of radiation sources in the 115 nm to 400 nm spectral range
    without significant loss in accuracy and the measurement of spectrally and spatially
    resolved radiance profiles such as to image the plasma topography of the discharge.
    The new instrumentation is described. Results for the radiometric long-term stability
    of selected deuterium lamps are shown. The radiance and radiant intensity as well
    as the radiance profile of different types of commercially available deuterium
    lamp are presented.</p>"
