  content: "<p>The spectral responsivity of Ge photodiodes and thin-film thermopiles
    has been measured between 1 µm and 20 µm. These detectors are used as transfer
    standards for the spectral responsivity measurements made at the Nederlands Meetinstituut-Van
    Swinden Laboratorium (NMi-VSL) monochromator-based cryogenic radiometer facility.
    For measurements beyond 2.5 µm we used an Ar maxi-arc as infrared source in combination
    with a single-grating monochromator. Below 2.5 µm a quartz-tungsten-halogen lamp
    is used as light source in conjunction with a double-grating monochromator. An
    optical system based on three mirrors is used to match the <italic>f</italic>-numbers
    of the monochromator and cryogenic radiometer with negligible residual astigmatism.
    In this paper we discuss the design of the facility, the characteristics of the
    transfer standards used and the estimated uncertainty budget of the infrared measurements.</p>"
