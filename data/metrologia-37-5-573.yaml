  content: "<p>The key quantity in the calibration of solar cells and photovoltaic
    modules is the short-circuit current of the device generated by a reference solar
    radiation with 1 kW m<sup>âˆ’2</sup> total irradiance and with reference solar spectral
    irradiance distribution. Thus, (i) double spectral mismatch between test and standard
    device and between test and reference solar spectrum; and (ii) the calibration
    transfer from low to high irradiance level (non-linearity effects) may affect
    the calibration value. An overview of primary and secondary calibration procedures
    is given, focusing on the primary calibration methods applied by the four qualified
    laboratories establishing the World Photovoltaic Scale (WPVS) traceable to the
    International System of Units (SI). The differential spectral responsivity method
    of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) is described in more detail.
    Finally, different approaches are illustrated for the evaluation of a reference
    value, including the WPVS, based on the results for twenty transfer/travelling
    standards of the international comparison among eleven participants that was carried
    out to establish the WPVS.</p>"
