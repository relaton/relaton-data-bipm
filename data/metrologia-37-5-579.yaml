abstract:
- content: "<p>A laser-based facility has been developed to provide high-flux, monochromatic,
    Lambertian radiation over the spectral range 0.2 µm to 18 µm. The facility was
    designed to reduce the uncertainties in a variety of radiometric applications,
    including irradiance and radiance responsivity calibrations. The operational characteristics
    of the facility are discussed and the results of detector responsivity calibrations
    over the spectral range 0.406 µm to 0.920 µm are presented.</p>"
