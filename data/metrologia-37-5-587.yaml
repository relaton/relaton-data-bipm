  content: "<p>The achievements of modern optoelectronics have resulted in the widespread
    use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in products designed to visualize information,
    especially in light devices for use in road-safety systems. These developments
    highlight the importance of metrological support for measurements of the photometric
    characteristics of semiconductor light sources. A standard light-source model
    based on Corvette Light Corporation high-luminance LEDs has been created and studied.
    The high-luminance LEDs were manufactured to a unique design using planar technology.
    The results of the study demonstrate the stability of the metrological characteristics
    of the LED-based standard source.</p>"
