abstract:
- content: "<p>Theoretical results for the total flux transmitted by a circular aperture
    are reviewed for four theories of propagation: rigorous theory, Kirchhoff diffraction
    theory, Fresnel diffraction theory, and geometrical optics. Curves are given which
    indicate, for a desired accuracy, the wavelength and aperture size at which the
    theories diverge. The implications for flux calculations and area measurements
    are discussed. Measurements of the transmission of a medium-sized aperture support
    the validity of the Kirchhoff and rigorous theories over the Fresnel and geometrical
    theories at optical wavelengths, but are unable to determine decisively the most
    accurate theory.</p>"
