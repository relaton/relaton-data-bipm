  content: "<p>In the absolute integrating-sphere method, the total luminous flux
    of a lamp inside an integrating sphere is determined by comparing it with a known
    flux introduced into the sphere from an external light source. As the measurement
    geometry of the lamps to be compared is different, the spatial non-uniformity
    of the sphere surface may affect the results. In order to evaluate this effect,
    the spatial response must be measured. Miniature incandescent lamps have been
    used as scanning-beam sources in previous realizations, but these lamps are not
    widely available. In the present realization of the luminous-flux unit by the
    Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used
    as the light source in scanning the spatial response. Preliminary results confirm
    the applicability of the LED scanner and indicate moderate deviations of about
    1 % from earlier luminous-flux calibrations.</p>"
