abstract:
- content: "<p>A new Medium-Background Facility (MBF) for the calibration of infrared
    sources and sensors has been designed by specialists from the All-Russian Research
    Institute for Optophysical Measurements (VNIIOFI) under contract to the Xi'an
    Institute of Applied Optics (China). The facility consists of several detachable
    modules, the configuration of which can be changed to suit the requirements of
    a specific task. The modular design allows flexible and independent use of the
    main components and simplifies upgrading. The facility was designed to allow absolute
    radiometric calibration of black-body sources and IR sensors; to compare the radiometric
    scale with predictions for measured temperatures; to allow measurements over an
    extended temperature range (up to the indium point); and to serve as the IR spectral
    radiance standard. Intended for the calibration of IR sensors and sources under
    vacuum conditions (10<sup>âˆ’3</sup> Pa) and a medium-background environment (liquid-nitrogen-cooled
    shroud), the MBF is briefly described with reference to its design, operating
    principles and measurement results.</p>"
