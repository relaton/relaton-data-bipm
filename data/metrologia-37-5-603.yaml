  content: "<p>A high-accuracy lens-transmission measurement facility has been constructed
    and tested. The facility uses a tuneable laser source to allow measurements of
    lens transmission at discrete monochromatic wavelengths in the range 200 nm to
    10 Âµm. Lenses of focal lengths from 300 mm to 750 mm can be measured to between
    1 part in 10<sup>4</sup> and 1 part in 10<sup>3</sup>, depending on wavelength.</p>"
