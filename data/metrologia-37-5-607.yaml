abstract:
- content: "<p>A new concentrator-collimator lighting system based on light-emitting
    diode (LED) technology is presented. Using an array of LEDs as source, by means
    of a three-dimensional concentrator and a parabolic collimator, this device makes
    it possible to obtain an integrated light beam with a high intensity level and
    the desired divergence, in a compact geometry with small output area. It offers
    low consumption and a long lifetime. An optical model allowing control of the
    beam parameters is presented together with a design for thermal stabilization
    of the device. These characteristics make it applicable in a variety of fields
    where high luminous intensity, quasi-monochromatic light and narrow angular distributions
    are needed, among them road signalization. To improve the colour rendering it
    would be necessary to use a white LED or three different LEDs in an array.</p>"
