abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we report a theoretical analysis of the distortion effects
    on the probability distribution of the photon number for a classical state of
    light, induced by non-ideal detectors with non-unitary quantum efficiency and
    dead time. We present a theory for the reconstruction of the true photon arrival-time
    distribution, evaluating the probability of detecting the n-th photon at a fixed
    time.</p>"
