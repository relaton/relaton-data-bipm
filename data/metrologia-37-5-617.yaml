abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A new approach is proposed to the calibration of photodetectors and
    the determination of the absolute value of the quantum efficiency of photon-counting
    photomultipliers using entangled-photon pairs. It is based on a new single-photodetector
    technique and a special modulation of the entangled-photon flux. The absolute
    values of the quantum efficiency have been determined for several photon-counting
    photomultipliers.</p>"
