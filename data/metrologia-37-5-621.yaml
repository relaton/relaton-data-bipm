abstract:
- content: "<p>The determination of the geometrical and effective area for optical-quality
    apertures is one of the fundamental sources of uncertainty in many radiometric
    and photometric measurements. The National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) has developed two non-contact instruments for measuring the area of these
    optical apertures. Some details of the instruments and their capabilities are
    presented. Both instruments can be used to measure the area of apertures with
    diameters ranging from 3.5 mm to 25 mm. The measurements using the absolute instrument
    result in k = 2 relative uncertainties ranging from 3 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for 25
    mm diameter apertures 5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> for 3.5 mm diameter apertures. The uncertainty
    depends to some extent on the quality of the edge and the diameter of the aperture.
    The measurements using the relative instrument result in k = 2 relative uncertainties
    ranging from 2 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for 25 mm diameter apertures to 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup>
    for 3.5 mm diameter apertures, assuming adequate optical-edge quality. For apertures
    with an edge of very poor quality, the difference between geometrical and effective
    area can be as high as 0.3 %. The increased uncertainty largely arises from scattering
    from the edge. Both instruments play a major role in the Consultative Committee
    for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) key comparison on aperture area, which began
    in 1999.</p>"
