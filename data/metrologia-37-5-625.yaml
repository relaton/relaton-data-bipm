abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental set-up based on correlated photons has been developed
    at the Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale G. Ferraris (IEN) for the absolute measurement
    of the quantum efficiency and dead time of single-photon counting photodiodes.
    The overall accuracy is improved with respect to previously reported results,
    by using a thin and highly transmitting non-linear crystal. For comparison, a
    conventional set-up has been developed at 632.8 nm with a He-Ne laser, a trap
    detector and calibrated neutral-density filters. Measurements at different count
    levels have been performed with both techniques and results are compared for the
    quantum efficiency in the limit of zero count, η<sub>0</sub>, and for the dead-time
    measurement, t<sub>D</sub>. Contributions to the final uncertainty are analysed
    for both techniques. The results obtained are η<sub>0</sub> = 0.3372 (standard
    uncertainty u(η<sub>0</sub>) = 0.0016) and t<sub>D</sub> = 33.8 ns (u(t<sub>D</sub>)
    = 2.0 ns) in the case of the two-photon technique and η'<sub>0</sub> = 0.3376
    (u(η'<sub>0</sub>) = 0.0036) and t'<sub>D</sub> = 31.7 ns (u(t'<sub>D</sub>) =
    5.4 ns) in the case of the conventional technique.</p>"
