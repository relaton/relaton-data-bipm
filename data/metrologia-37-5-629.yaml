abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this paper is a critical investigation of some correction
    factors in the quantum-efficiency calibration of photodetectors, in the photon-counting
    regime, by means of correlated photons generated through a parametric down-conversion
    process inside a non-linear crystal. An analysis is given of the main correction
    factors found in a real experimental situation, with different techniques for
    performing coincidence counts.</p>"
