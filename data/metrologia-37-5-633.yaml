  content: <p>A set-up for the accurate measurement of aperture areas based on the
    superposition of Gaussian laser beams to generate a uniform irradiance has been
    developed at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The uncertainty
    budget for this method is presented. Results obtained for several apertures are
    compared with calibrations made at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). Measurements
    made on different types of aperture are also compared with the results of an additional
    technique for determining area ratios. In this case the agreement depends systematically
    on the type of aperture, because of the imperfect structure of the aperture edges.
    This work highlights the importance of the determination of the "effective area"
    for the intended application of the aperture and the use of high-quality diamond-turned
    apertures.</p>
