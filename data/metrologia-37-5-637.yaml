  content: "<p>Beam-limiting apertures with accurately known areas are required when
    measuring the radiance and irradiance of sources. We have already described a
    non-contact method for measuring aperture areas using a laser beam focused on
    the aperture surface. By shifting the aperture relative to the laser beam, and
    collecting and monitoring the reflected light, the onset of reflection was used
    to indicate the position of the aperture edges. We have now improved this approach
    by evaluating the position-dependence of the reflection signal recorded across
    the aperture edge. Whereas the former approach required a determination of the
    laser focus diameter to correct the measured aperture diameter, the quantity that
    makes the main contribution to the overall uncertainty of the aperture area, the
    new approach implicitly determines the laser focus diameter, so reducing the corresponding
    uncertainty and making it possible to determine aperture diameters with standard
    uncertainties of less than 0.2 Âµm. Measurements made in 1998 for aluminium apertures
    are compared with results obtained in 1995 using the same apertures.</p>"
