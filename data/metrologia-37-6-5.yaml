abstract:
- content: "<p>The least-squares procedure for obtaining the parameters of a curve
    adjusted to a set of measured values is discussed. Two algorithms are presented
    in matrix notation, which can handle the general case where all input quantities
    are uncertain. Attention is paid to the consistency of the adjustment. Two examples
    show that the algorithms exhibit comparable performances.</p>"
