  content: "<p>A generic method for the preparation of primary gas mixtures is described.
    This description forms the basis for a detailed analysis of all sources of uncertainty.
    Expressions are derived for the combined standard uncertainty in a single weighing
    cycle as well as for a transferred mass of gas. The expressions are rigorous,
    as they take into account all aspects, including dependencies between variables
    introduced by the preparation process. The strengths of these dependencies are
    evaluated in a generalized way, in order to find out whether the rigorous expressions
    can be simplified without limiting their validity under practical conditions.
    The model can be simplified by assessing the covariance between results of weighing
    cycles, as it can be demonstrated that this covariance will never become significant
    compared with the uncertainty in the result of a weighing.</p>"
