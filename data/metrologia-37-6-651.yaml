  content: "<p>With the aid of two diode-laser narrowband spectrometers around 633
    nm, we report the measurement of the iodine hyperfine components of the R(60)
    8-4, R(125) 9-4 and P(54) 8-4 transitions located −12 GHz from the classical red
    He-Ne laser stabilized on the R(127) 11-5 transition of <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>,
    the P(33) 6-3 transition roughly −1 GHz away, the P(39) 6-3 transition 3.4 GHz
    above, and the R(59) 8-4 and P(53) 8-4 transitions roughly 19 GHz above. The Doppler-free
    absorption signals were resolved using a third-harmonic detection technique and
    hyperfine frequency splittings were measured by beat-frequency techniques. The
    individual hyperfine transitions were linked to a 633 nm He-Ne laser by direct
    frequency measurements up to 16 GHz. The experimental standard uncertainty was
    typically below 5 kHz (i.e. relative uncertainty &lt;1 × 10<sup>−11</sup>).</p>"
