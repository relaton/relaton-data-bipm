abstract:
- content: <p>Measurement of amounts or concentrations of catalysts is of great usefulness
    in science, technology, and especially in the health services. When it is impossible
    or impractical to measure amount of substance or mass of catalyst, its amount
    may be expressed by the catalysed change in a substrate entity as evidenced by
    some measure appropriate to the particular measuring system. Initially, the concomitant
    units were specific for each catalyst and measurement procedure. Later an independent
    universal unit was defined as "1 µmole of substrate utilized per minute under
    specified conditions of pH and temperature control". Eventually, catalytic activity
    (as a measure of amount) became defined by catalysed rate of conversion in mole
    per second with the suggested name "katal" (kat). A recent petition by the International
    Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine to the Comité International
    des Poids et Mesures, asking for inclusion of "katal" among the special names
    for SI derived units, was discussed and recommended by the Consultative Committee
    for Units and the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance, and subsequently
    adopted by the 21st Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures in 1999, referring
    to human health and safety and promotion of SI units. This decision should improve
    the traceability and comparability of results.</p>
