abstract:
- content: "<p>The primary clocks CS1, CS2 and CS3 of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) have contributed to the realization of International Atomic
    Time, TAI (Temps Atomique International), throughout 1999. Their operation, their
    performance and the uncertainty with which they realized the International System
    of Units (SI) second are described in some detail, together with the results and
    associated uncertainties of comparisons of the realized second with the TAI scale
    unit for each clock.</p>"
