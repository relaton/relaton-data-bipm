  content: "<p>An interlaboratory comparison of the different realizations of the
    triple point of water (TPW) in Europe has been organized by EUROMET (Project No.
    278). This project was based on the circulation of one TPW cell and an isothermal
    enclosure. The national metrology institutes of thirteen countries and the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures were involved in the work. Twenty-seven TPW
    cells were compared. Half of the results lie between âˆ’0.05 mK and +0.05 mK of
    the mean value, and all but two of the results are within 0.10 mK of the mean.</p>"
