  content: "<p>This second international comparison between He-Ne lasers at 543 nm
    exhibits similar results to the first international comparison. A standard uncertainty
    of 4 kHz was obtained against 2 kHz in 1993, while the average frequency difference
    between the lasers was −1.0 kHz against 14.2 kHz in 1993. The experimental data
    indicate however that a standard uncertainty below 1 kHz can be expected between
    two lasers. The frequency difference between the two lasers clearly lies within
    the limits (2.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>) given in the revised practical realization
    of the definition of the metre (1997) for the 633 nm He-Ne laser.</p>"
