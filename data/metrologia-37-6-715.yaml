abstract:
- content: "<p>The relativistic red shift for the new caesium fountain at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at Boulder, USA, has been estimated
    using two independent methods. Method 1 uses the EGM96 geopotential model to estimate
    the geopotential number, C, and subsequently the frequency offset, −C/c<sup>2</sup>
    (c being the speed of light), obtaining the value 1797.8 × 10<sup>−16</sup> with
    an estimated standard uncertainty of 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. Method 2 uses the
    geopotential number from the National Geodetic Survey data sheet for the NIST
    marker and gives a frequency offset of 1798.9 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, with an estimated
    standard uncertainty of 0.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>.</p>"
