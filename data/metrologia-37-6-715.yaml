  content: "<p>The relativistic red shift for the new caesium fountain at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at Boulder, USA, has been estimated
    using two independent methods. Method 1 uses the EGM96 geopotential model to estimate
    the geopotential number, <italic>C</italic>, and subsequently the frequency offset,
    −<italic>C</italic>/<italic>c</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>c</italic> being the
    speed of light), obtaining the value 1797.8 × 10<sup>−16</sup> with an estimated
    standard uncertainty of 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. Method 2 uses the geopotential
    number from the National Geodetic Survey data sheet for the NIST marker and gives
    a frequency offset of 1798.9 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, with an estimated standard uncertainty
    of 0.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>.</p>"
