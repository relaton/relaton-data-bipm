abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized
    633 nm He-Ne lasers locked either by the fifth- or the third-harmonic technique
    was carried out at the Finnish Centre for Metrology and Accreditation (MIKES)
    in September 1998. The participating laboratories were the MIKES; the Metrology
    Research Institute, Helsinki University of Technology (HUT); the Chinese National
    Institute of Metrology (NIM); the Czech Metrological Institute (CMI); the D. I.
    Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM); and the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM). Raw measured frequency differences between lasers were in the
    following ranges: −5.2 kHz to +11.9 kHz and −5.8 kHz to +4.9 kHz for the third-
    and fifth-harmonic locking techniques, respectively. The frequency offsets between
    the third- and fifth-harmonic techniques for different components (d to g) were
    in the range 26 kHz to 35 kHz. The relative frequency stability of lasers given
    by the Allan standard deviations reached 2.6 × 10<sup>−13</sup> for two lasers
    using the third harmonic and only 1 × 10<sup>−12</sup> for the same lasers using
    the fifth harmonic for a 2000 s sampling time. This comparison is part of the
    ongoing laser comparison carried out under the auspices of the Consultative Committee
    for Length (CCL, formerly CCDM) of the Comité International des Poids et Mesures
    (CIPM); it is also a EUROMET project (No. 462).</p>"
