  content: "<p>A high-temperature calorimeter has been developed for studying the
    equilibrium melting behaviour of substances used for realizing the thermometric
    fixed points. Conventional cells of either 5 cm or 2.5 cm diameter can be accommodated.
    Using the calorimeter, the equilibrium melting curves of three high-purity silver
    samples were measured. The samples have narrow melting ranges: two of 1.5 mK and
    one of about 0.5 mK from 10 % liquid sample fraction to the last measured point
    near 70 % liquid, yet their liquidus points differ by nearly 5 mK. It was found
    that 1/<italic>F</italic> plots cannot be used to determine the deviation of the
    melting point of real silver samples from that of ideally pure silver.</p>"
