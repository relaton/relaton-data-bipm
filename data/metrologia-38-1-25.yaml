  content: "<p>We have built an atom interferometer that can measure <italic>g</italic>,
    the local acceleration due to gravity, with a resolution of Δ<italic>g</italic>/<italic>g</italic>
    = 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> after a single 1.3 s measurement cycle, 3 × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    after 1 min and 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> after two days of integration time. The difference
    between our value for <italic>g</italic> and one obtained by a falling corner-cube
    optical interferometer is (7 ± 7) × 10<sup>−9</sup> <italic>g</italic>. The atom
    interferometer uses velocity-selective stimulated Raman transitions and laser-cooled
    caesium atoms in an atomic fountain. We extend previous methods of analysing the
    interferometer to include the effects of a gravitational gradient. We also present
    detailed experimental and theoretical studies of potential systematic errors and
    noise sources.</p>"
