abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is described to determine the volume of a mass standard from
    weighings made in air of differing density against a reference volume artefact.
    Standard uncertainties in volume of 2 parts in 10<sub>5</sub> (at 1 kg) or better
    are readily achievable with this method, using adequate measuring facilities.
    The advantages of the method are that volume determination and mass calibration
    may be carried out simultaneously and that the mass standard is subjected to a
    variation in air density of only Â±5 % or less, compared with conventional hydrostatic
    weighing methods where the mass standard is immersed in water. Examples are presented
    of the use of the method for confirming values assigned to mass standards and
    for full volume determination, together with uncertainty calculations.</p>"
