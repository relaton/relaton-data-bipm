abstract:
- content: "<p>We have built an atom interferometer that can measure g, the local
    acceleration due to gravity, with a resolution of Δg/g = 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> after
    a single 1.3 s measurement cycle, 3 × 10<sup>−9</sup> after 1 min and 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>
    after two days of integration time. The difference between our value for g and
    one obtained by a falling corner-cube optical interferometer is (7 ± 7) × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    g. The atom interferometer uses velocity-selective stimulated Raman transitions
    and laser-cooled caesium atoms in an atomic fountain. We extend previous methods
    of analysing the interferometer to include the effects of a gravitational gradient.
    We also present detailed experimental and theoretical studies of potential systematic
    errors and noise sources.</p>"
