abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent paper described the propagation of uncertainty with polynomial
    or Lagrange interpolation and demonstrated a number of mathematical results that
    simplify the calculation of uncertainty. This paper extends the analysis to any
    interpolation that can be expressed as a linear combination of functions. Examples
    of this form include Gauss, Fourier and linear least-squares interpolations, as
    well as a wide range of application-specific interpolations employing a combination
    of functional forms. Application of the results is illustrated by considering
    a number of the non-Lagrangian interpolation equations of the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). A comparison of Lagrange and least-squares approaches
    is used to highlight the benefits of the latter.</p>"
