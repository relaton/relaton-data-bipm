  content: "<p>A recent study identified boron, sodium, aluminium and silicon as the
    dominant impurities in triple point of water (TPW) cells. These results suggest
    that borosilicate glass is a less than ideal container as it is the most likely
    source of the contaminating elements. An estimate for the rate of change of the
    equilibrium temperature of TPW cells is presented using results recently obtained
    at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and supplemented by those reported
    in 1982 by Furukawa and Bigge of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST). An analysis of the two data sets suggests that a decrease of 4 ÂµK per
    year is appropriate in describing the average behaviour of TPW cells. The conclusion
    is speculative in that the behaviour of the various cells has not been monitored
    over a period of time to track the nature of the changes. Rather, the analysis
    assumes that the changes have occurred continuously and linearly with time.</p>"
