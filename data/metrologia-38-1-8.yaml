abstract:
- content: "<p>The feasibility of levitating a mass for generating and/or measuring
    dynamic force is discussed. Force can be determined by measuring the acceleration
    of a well-known rigid mass. Under the influence of the Earth's gravity, dynamic
    force can be accurately generated and/or measured by realizing horizontal linear
    motion with a sufficiently small external force. A pneumatic linear bearing is
    suitable for this purpose. The problems of using this method in metrology are
    analysed and proposals made for their resolution.</p>"
