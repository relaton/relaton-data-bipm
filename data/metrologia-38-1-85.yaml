  content: "<p>International measurements of the molar volume of single-crystal silicon
    based on fifteen different samples have confirmed the 1986 value of the Avogadro
    constant recommended by the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA)
    but have not confirmed the 1998 CODATA recommended value and a value published
    recently. The concluding recommendation of this letter, therefore, is not to include
    the result for the particular sample used to obtain the latter value in any statistical
    analysis or adjustments of the values of fundamental physical constants.</p>"
