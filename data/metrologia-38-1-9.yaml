abstract:
- content: "<p>The Welch-Satterthwaite (W-S) formula is a classical, approximate method
    for combining several sample estimates of normal population variances. However,
    the W-S formula is routinely applied to the results of physical measurements even
    though uncertainties may include those of Type B. This paper considers the validity
    of the W-S formula as a means of obtaining a confidence interval for the measurand.
    The classical concept of a confidence interval provides performance criteria that
    can be used to assess the W-S formula by simulation. Examples presented include
    the combination of two Type A uncertainties, and the combination of one Type A
    and one Type B uncertainty. The results show that the W-S formula performs very
    well. This finding contrasts with the findings of other recent studies which did
    not apply classical performance criteria.</p>"
