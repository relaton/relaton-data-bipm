abstract:
- content: "<p>The procedure for uncertainty assessment set out in the Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, published by the International Organization
    for Standardization (ISO), is compared with an alternative system. The ISO Guide
    links the overall uncertainty to a so-called k<sub>P</sub> factor, implicitly
    expressing the degree of confidence that the measured result should cover the
    true value of the physical quantity in question. Here it is argued that this standard
    procedure, in which the magnitude of a given kp factor is tied to the degree of
    confidence, presents the experimenter with difficulties. These arise from the
    need to associate a probability density with so-called unknown systematic errors.
    Consequently, the recommended procedures may not be taken up by experimenters
    who carry out laboratory measurements on a daily basis.</p><p>A simplification
    of the ISO procedure suggested by the Guide involves the assignment of the values
    1 or 2 (or even 3) to k<sub>P</sub>. The alternative approach presented here argues
    that this simplification does not reflect the prevailing physical situation, and
    that the degree of confidence obtained lacks physical objectivity. Stationary
    measurement processes, strictly separating random and unknown systematic errors,
    are considered. Random errors are assumed to be normally distributed, and no probability
    distribution density is attributed to the unknown systematic errors. As random
    and systematic errors are kept separate, it is possible to express the influence
    of random errors by generalized confidence intervals (from Student's t-distribution)
    and the influence of systematic errors by worst-case estimates. No confidence
    statement is associated with the overall uncertainties, and the intrinsic problem
    of the Guide is circumvented. The formalisms are robust, transparent, and locate
    measured quantities with reasonable reliability.</p>"
