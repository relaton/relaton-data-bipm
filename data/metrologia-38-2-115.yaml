abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of a theory describing the frequency offset in an atomic
    clock caused by unwanted excitation of hyperfine σ-transitions (ΔF = ±1, Δm<sub>F</sub>
    = ±1) are transferred to the primary clock CS1 of the PhysikalischTechnische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB). The calculated relative frequency offset amounts to −3.8 × 10<sup>−15</sup>,
    which is about half the uncertainty of the clock. The corresponding frequency
    offsets of the other PTB primary clocks are estimated.</p>"
