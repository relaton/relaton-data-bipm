  content: "<p>The results of a theory describing the frequency offset in an atomic
    clock caused by unwanted excitation of hyperfine σ-transitions (Δ<italic>F</italic>
    = ±1, Δ<italic>m</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> = ±1) are transferred to
    the primary clock CS1 of the PhysikalischTechnische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The calculated
    relative frequency offset amounts to −3.8 × 10<sup>−15</sup>, which is about half
    the uncertainty of the clock. The corresponding frequency offsets of the other
    PTB primary clocks are estimated.</p>"
