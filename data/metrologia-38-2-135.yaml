abstract:
- content: "<p>The concept of the self-improving measuring system was outlined in
    December 1999 in PTB-Mitteilungen and its extended application in pycnometric
    density measurements is presented here. This new approach is better for processing
    experimental data, within a measuring system comprising more than one identical
    measuring device, when individual liquids and/or pairs of very similar liquids
    are studied. It uses future measurement results for unknown objects to improve
    the calibration characteristics of the instruments involved. Our approach requires
    that both calibration and measurement results be processed by a common mathematical
    procedure based on non-linear regression. Examples taken from our precise density
    measurements of six individual liquids and three pairs of liquid hydrocarbons,
    using four silica capillary flask pycnometers, prove the usefulness of such an
    approach.</p>"
