  content: "<p>The concept of the <italic>self-improving measuring system</italic>
    was outlined in December 1999 in <italic>PTB-Mitteilungen</italic> and its extended
    application in pycnometric density measurements is presented here. This new approach
    is better for processing experimental data, within a measuring system comprising
    more than one identical measuring device, when <italic>individual liquids</italic>
    and/or <italic>pairs of very similar liquids</italic> are studied. It uses future
    measurement results for unknown objects to improve the calibration characteristics
    of the instruments involved. Our approach requires that both calibration and measurement
    results be processed by a common mathematical procedure based on non-linear regression.
    Examples taken from our precise density measurements of six individual liquids
    and three pairs of liquid hydrocarbons, using four silica capillary flask pycnometers,
    prove the usefulness of such an approach.</p>"
