  content: "<p>Four methods for cleaning stainless-steel 1 kg weights were investigated
    as part of research aimed at improving the long-term stability of such mass artefacts
    by means of cleaning. Weights were repeatedly cleaned at intervals of 3 to 4 days
    and changes in mass measured by comparison with other standard weights. The most
    promising method is cleaning in a Soxhlet apparatus using ethanol, with a measured
    standard deviation of 2.5 µg for the change in mass due to cleaning and no resolvable
    net change in mass after consecutive cleanings. Similar repeatability was measured
    for cleaning in an ultrasonic bath containing ethanol, and for boiling in water,
    but average net losses in mass per cleaning of (1.6 ± 0.5) µg (1 s) and (1.1 ±
    0.6) µg (1 s), respectively, were obsewere observed for these methods. Cleaning
    in a Soxhlet apparatus using water caused mass variations of up to to ±40 µg.
    Repeated cleaning produces a recognizable pattern of mass changes that can be
    used to confirm successfusuccessful cleaning of a weight after only two cleanings.
    Results on the increase in mass following cleaning are also presented.</p>"
