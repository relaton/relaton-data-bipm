  content: "<p>The results are presented of a bilateral comparison of pneumatic pressure
    measurements, carried out in the framework of EUROMET Project No. 537, between
    the Cesky Metrologicky Institut (CMI, Czech Republic) and the TÜBITAK-Ulusal Metroloji
    Enstitüsü (UME, Turkey). The measurements, in the range 15 kPa to 7 MPa, were
    carried out in two phases: (i) 18-24 June 1999 at the Pressure Section of the
    CMI in the range 15 kPa to 350 kPa; (ii) 29 June-8 July 1999 at the Pressure Section
    of the UME in the ranges 0.25 MPa to 1.75 MPa and 1 MPa to 7 MPa. Three different
    gas-operated reference standards were used. For the ranges 15 kPa to 350 kPa and
    0.25 MPa to 1.75 MPa these were piston-cylinder assemblies with ceramic pistons
    and tungsten-carbide cylinders and nominal effective areas of 10 cm<sup>2</sup>
    and 2 cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. For the range 1 MPa to 7 MPa, a piston-cylinder
    assembly with tungsten-carbide piston and cylinder and a nominal effective area
    of 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> was used. The purpose of the measurements was to compare
    the effective areas of the Czech and Turkish primary pressure standards in gas
    media and gauge mode, and to confirm the agreement between the pressure scales
    of the two countries in the range 15 kPa to 7 MPa by application of the cross-floating
    method. Since the UME and the CMI are participating in different loops of EUROMET
    Project No. 439, a key comparison of pneumatic pressure, another important goal
    of this study was to establish a cross-link between the two loops.</p>"
