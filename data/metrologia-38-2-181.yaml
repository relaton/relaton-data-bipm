abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports the eighth set of results of a series of grouped
    laser comparisons from national laboratories undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the request of the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition
    du Mètre (CCDM, now the Consultative Committee for Length, CCL) during the periods
    July 1993 to September 1995 and March 1997 to July 1997. This comparison, like
    the previous seven, is expected to be listed as a key comparison in the context
    of the ongoing BIPM.L-K10 series.</p><p>The results of this comparison involving
    five lasers, four from three countries of the Asia-Pacific group and one from
    the BIPM, meet the goals set by the CCDM in 1992 and adopted by the International
    Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) the same year. The standard uncertainty
    (1 σ) of the frequency of the He-Ne laser stabilized on the saturated absorption
    of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at 633 nm is reduced to the level of 12 kHz (2.5
    × 10<sup>11</sup>) when the lasers compared meet the recommended values of the
    parameters.</p><p>The lasers were first compared with the BIPMP3 laser, with all
    the lasers set to the parameter values normally used in each laboratory; the results
    then ranged from −112.7 kHz to +24.9 kHz. After checking and correcting the values
    of all the parameters and replacing a contaminated iodine cell, the range was
    reduced to −31.5 kHz to +14.3 kHz. Under the latter conditions, the average frequency
    difference of the group of lasers, with respect to the BIPM4 laser, was −1.9 kHz
    with a standard uncertainty (1 σ) of 20.2 kHz. The best frequency stabilities,
    with relative Allan standard deviations of about 6.6 × 10<sup>12</sup>, 6.0 ×
    10<sup>13</sup> and 1.3 × 10<sup>13</sup>, were observed with sampling times of
    1 s, 100 s and 1000 s, respectively. The overall best value was 9.5 × 10<sup>14</sup>
    for a sampling time of 6000 s.</p>"
