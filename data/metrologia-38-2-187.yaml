- content: "<p>Within the EUROMET Project No. 446 participants from eight European
    countries have measured the magnetic flux density with frequencies up to 20 kHz
    generated in a field coil acting as transfer standard. Different methods have
    been applied by the various institutes to determine the coil constant of the standard
    and its frequency dependence in ac and dc fields.</p>"
