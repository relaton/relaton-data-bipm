abstract:
- content: "<p>Adsorption and desorption of cleaning products are among the most important
    contributions to the instability of mass standards. An optical method, the mirage
    effect, is proposed to investigate the adsorption/desorption of cleaning solvents
    on the surface of mass standards at conditions close to normal temperature and
    pressure (NTP). A theoretical model of the mirage effect in the presence of an
    adsorbable vapour is recalled, relating the amplitude and phase of the mirage
    deflection to the adsorption isotherm. Representing this isotherm with the BET
    (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) equation and introducing an inverse procedure, the
    parameters characterizing the adsorption process, such as the amount of adsorbed
    matter in the first monolayer and the differential heat of adsorption, are obtained.
    Experimental results for the adsorption of acetone, ethanol and isopropanol on
    XSH alacrite are presented that agree qualitatively with results from more conventional
    methods.</p>"
