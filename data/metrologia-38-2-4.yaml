abstract:
- content: "<p>Laser diffraction is a robust and precise technique for measuring wire
    diameters. However, classical Fraunhofer diffraction formulas are inappropriate
    for determining the size of three-dimensional objects. Babinet's principle (from
    classical diffraction theory) allows the use of such formulas only for angles
    of diffraction tending to zero. In practice diffraction measurements require a
    finite angular range (about 10°) for good resolution. We show that use of the
    classical slit-diffraction formula for this extended angular interval introduces
    significant error. We develop a simple diffraction model valid for cylindrical
    shapes and a formula to obtain the diameter of cylindrical wires. To validate
    the diffraction formula we calibrate the diameter of the wires using an independent
    interferometric technique, which to our knowledge is original for this particular
    task. We have verified our diffraction formula to within about 0.2 µm for various
    wire materials and diameters (30 µm to 300 µm) and a wide angular range (±25°).
    Two different experimental set-ups were implemented to increase the reliability
    of the results. The calibration procedure revealed a systematic disagreement with
    Babinet's principle, in particular a systematic overestimation of the diameter
    by about 0.6 µm, almost independent of the material and the diameter itself. This
    is particularly relevant to metrological applications involving diffraction phenomena
    and based on classical diffraction theory.</p>"
