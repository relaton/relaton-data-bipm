abstract:
- content: <p>The position versus time data from a free-fall absolute gravimeter can
    be used to estimate the vertical gravity gradient in addition to the gravity value
    itself. Hipkin has reported success in estimating the vertical gradient value
    using a data set of unusually good quality. This paper explores techniques that
    may be applicable to a broader class of data that may be contaminated with "system
    response" errors of larger magnitude than were evident in the data used by Hipkin.
    This system response function is usually modelled as a sum of exponentially decaying
    sinusoidal components. The technique employed here involves combining the x<sub>0</sub>,
    v<sub>0</sub> and g from all the drops made during a site occupation into a single
    least-squares solution, and including the value of the vertical gradient and the
    coefficients of system response function in the same solution. The resulting non-linear
    equations must be solved iteratively and convergence presents some difficulties.
    Sparse matrix techniques are used to make the least-squares problem computationally
    tractable.</p>
