  content: "<p>Gas mass flows can be measured most accurately using continuously measuring
    dynamic-gravimetric systems. Two systems of this type, the mass flow calibration
    system at the Bureau National de MÃ©trologie-Laboratoire National d'Essais (BNM-LNE,
    France) and the mass flow calibration system at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB, Germany), were compared twice using a commercial gas flow measuring instrument
    as a transfer standard. Mass flow rates of nitrogen between 0.5 mg/s and 20 mg/s
    (approximately 25 ml/min to 1000 ml/min) and mass flow rates of carbon monoxide
    between 0.5 mg/s and 10 mg/s (approximately 25 ml/min to 500 ml/min) were used
    to check the agreement of the two calibration systems. The results of the comparison
    show that the two systems do not deviate by more than 0.23 % for flow rates higher
    than 2 mg/s. For lower flows, down to 0.5 mg/s, the differences increased to as
    much as 0.37 %. The reason for this is not yet understood.</p>"
