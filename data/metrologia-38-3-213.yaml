  content: "<p>The melting and freezing plateaus of three metal-carbon eutectic alloys,
    cobalt-carbon, iridium-carbon and rhenium-carbon, were observed by radiation thermometry
    for the first time, and their repeatability evaluated. The observed melting temperatures
    were 1324 °C, 2290 °C and 2474 °C, respectively. A small dependence of the freezing
    temperature on the cooling rate was observed for the cobalt-carbon eutectic. Six
    metal-carbon eutectic points have previously been reported by the present authors:
    these, with their melting temperatures, are iron-carbon (1153 °C), nickel-carbon
    (1329 °C), palladium-carbon (1492 °C), rhodium-carbon (1657 °C), platinum-carbon
    (1738 °C), and ruthenium-carbon (1953 °C). These nine fixed-point temperatures
    cover the range from the copper point to 2500 °C. The evaluated melting-point
    repeatabilities (standard deviations) were generally better than 0.1 °C. The metal-carbon
    eutectic points seem to be a promising way of realizing fixed points for practical
    calibration of radiation thermometers. The two fixed points above 2500 K in particular
    are potentially useful for thermodynamic temperature determination based on thermal
    radiation, as well as for radiometry and photometry.</p>"
