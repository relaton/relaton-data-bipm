  content: "<p>An evaluation of the light shift in an optically pumped caesium-beam
    frequency standard is presented. We show that the light shift can be accurately
    estimated by taking into account the angular anisotropy of the spontaneous photon
    emission, the neglect of which is shown to give rise to an error comparable to
    the value of the shift. Our data refer to a complete set of optical transitions
    for the caesium D<sub>2</sub> line relevant to the KRISS-1 caesium-beam frequency
    standard.</p>"
