abstract:
- content: "<p>Six silver samples were doped with Pd, Fe, Au, In, Sn, Pb, Zn, Sb,
    Cu, Ni and Al. The resulting shifts in the equilibrium melting curves were then
    determined. All impurities caused a shift in the liquidus point of silver except
    aluminium, for which no conclusive results could be obtained. The shifts, in millikelvins,
    caused by one part per million by weight of each of the above impurities (with
    the exception of the last mentioned, Al), were determined to be +0.97, +0.13,
    +0.09, −0.49, −0.60, −0.48, −1.10, −0.73, −0.69, and −0.74, respectively. Four
    of the initial samples were recently acquired and of 99.9999 % purity. Their melting
    points were realized within a scatter band of ±0.55 mK. Using the above measured
    shifts and the amount of impurities detected in these samples by glow discharge
    mass spectrometry (GDMS), it is estimated that the liquidus points of these samples
    differ from that of ideally pure silver by no more than 1.0 mK within an expanded
    experimental standard deviation of the mean of 0.2 mK, using a coverage factor
    of 2.</p>"
