abstract:
- content: "<p>The most commonly used method in the calibration of step gauges is
    the coordinate measuring machine (CMM), equipped with a laser interferometer for
    the highest accuracy. This paper describes a modification to a length-bar measuring
    machine for the calibration of step gauges to a high accuracy. A system was also
    developed for interferometric measurements of the flatness and parallelism of
    gauge block faces for use in uncertainty calculations.</p>"
