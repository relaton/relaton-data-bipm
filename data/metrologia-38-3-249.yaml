  content: "<p>The upper limit to the power at which trap detectors have a linear
    response was recently measured. We have complemented these measurements by testing
    traps with an applied bias voltage at several visible wavelengths. We used Hamamatsu
    S1337-1010 silicon photodiodes, and also briefly tested the S5227-1010 photodiode.
    Application of a bias voltage increases the linearity limit by a factor of more
    than 10 for very narrow beams and of more than 30 for wide beams. No irreversible
    changes were detected even for the highest irradiance measured (33 W/cm<sup>2</sup>
    at 406 nm). The minimum bias voltages required for linearities of 99 %, 99.8 %
    and 99.95 % are presented for several beam sizes.</p>"
