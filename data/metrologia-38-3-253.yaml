  content: "<p>The original theory of the Senarmont compensator allows the calibration
    of a phase plate, C<sub>1</sub>, using the optical arrangement P-C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>-A,
    where P and A are respectively the polarizer and analyser and C<sub>2</sub> is
    an exact quarter-wave phase plate. Recently, it was shown that two plates, C<sub>1</sub>
    and C<sub>2</sub>, may be simultaneously calibrated using the same arrangement
    but with some restrictions on their retardance values at the working wavelengths.
    A further development of this model is presented that removes the restrictions
    on the ranges of retardance value allowed for the two plates.</p>"
