  content: "<p>Comparison measurements of the diameter of small ring gauges (0.1 mm
    to 1 mm) were carried out by six European national metrology institutes (NMIs).
    The participants applied different measurement principles: mechanical contacting
    measurement and optical measurement with respect to the projection of the inner
    diameter or with respect to the position of the cylinder edges. The uncertainties
    associated with the diameter measurement results vary considerably among the different
    participants, from <italic>U</italic> = 10 µm to <italic>U</italic> = 5 µm. In
    general the measurement results agree within their associated uncertainties, with
    the exception of the optical measurements of the position of the cylinder edges
    which exceed the reference values by between 10 µm and 30 µm, probably because
    of the lacerated edges of the ring gauges.</p>"
