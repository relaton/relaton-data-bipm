abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparison measurements of the diameter of small ring gauges (0.1 mm
    to 1 mm) were carried out by six European national metrology institutes (NMIs).
    The participants applied different measurement principles: mechanical contacting
    measurement and optical measurement with respect to the projection of the inner
    diameter or with respect to the position of the cylinder edges. The uncertainties
    associated with the diameter measurement results vary considerably among the different
    participants, from U = 10 µm to U = 5 µm. In general the measurement results agree
    within their associated uncertainties, with the exception of the optical measurements
    of the position of the cylinder edges which exceed the reference values by between
    10 µm and 30 µm, probably because of the lacerated edges of the ring gauges.</p>"
