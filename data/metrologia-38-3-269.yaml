abstract:
- content: "<p>This letter takes a brief look at gauge-block length as it is influenced
    to a subtle degree by the surface quality of the measuring face and the recent
    history of the gauge block environment. Change in length of short gauge blocks
    following wringing, and of long gauge blocks following air travel between laboratories,
    is demonstrated. These effects could have important implications for international
    comparison testing under time-limited conditions, particularly with the large
    number of comparisons related to the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
