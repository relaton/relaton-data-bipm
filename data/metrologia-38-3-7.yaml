abstract:
- content: "<p>The results are presented of calculation of the frequency dependence
    of an octofilar resistor, the resistive element of which is folded in such a way
    that it forms four long loops connected in series. Magnetic fluxes produced by
    the loops tend to cancel, similar to the fluxes produced by the two loops of the
    common quadrifilar reversed resistor. The folded length of the octofilar resistive
    element is one half of that of a quadrifilar resistor made from the same wire
    and having the same nominal resistance, and the octofilar resistor has a smaller
    frequency dependence. As an example, a 12906 Ω octofilar resistor is described,
    for which the frequency dependence of its parallel equivalent resistance is more
    than seven times smaller than that of a previously made 12906 Ω quadrifilar resistor
    in the frequency range 500 Hz to 5 kHz.</p>"
