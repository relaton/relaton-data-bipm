  content: "<p>We describe a simple method for measuring the amplitude of a laser's
    frequency modulation by counting the beat-frequency signal against an unmodulated
    reference laser. This method is useful in the case of the third-harmonic detection
    technique with 633 nm He-Ne/I<sub>2</sub> lasers. The estimated uncertainty of
    less than 1 part in 10<sup>3</sup> is much better (by at least a factor of 50)
    than that obtained using a radio-frequency (rf) spectral analyser.</p>"
