abstract:
- content: "<p>Experimental results from four recent research reports on the determination
    of the density/temperature relationship of Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW) under
    a pressure of 101 325 Pa are analysed and a new formula is recommended for metrological
    applications. This paper determines the formulae of density and relative density,
    with their uncertainties, in the temperature range 0 °C to 40 °C. The uncertainty
    estimation of one of the reports included in the analysis has been re-evaluated.
    Effects on water density due to isotopic mixtures other than SMOW, ambient pressures
    different from 101 325 Pa, and the presence of dissolved air, are also reviewed.</p>"
