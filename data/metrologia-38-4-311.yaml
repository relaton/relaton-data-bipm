abstract:
- content: "<p>A portable (32 cm × 13 cm × 6 cm) laser frequency standard has been
    constructed by frequency-stabilizing a miniaturized external-cavity diode laser
    to the Doppler-free spectrum of iodine. Compact structure is achieved using a
    novel transmission grating. The laser has excellent noise properties, which leads
    to a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of detection and allows direct observation
    of the inverse Lamb dips. The frequency stability matches that of iodine-stabilized
    He-Ne lasers at 633 nm; the relative frequency stability (square root of the Allan
    variance) follows a slope of 7.9 × 10<sup>−12</sup>τ<sup>−1/2</sup> (10 s &lt;
    τ &lt; 4000 s). The best stability, 1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> (47 Hz), is reached at
    an integration time of τ = 4000 s. The observed day-to-day repeatability (1σ)
    is 4 × 10<sup>−12</sup> (1.6 kHz). Extensive measurements were made to evaluate
    the dependence of the laser frequency on the various operational parameters.</p>"
