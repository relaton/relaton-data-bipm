  content: "<p>The melting and freezing behaviour of nickel was investigated using
    a vertical alumina crucible specially constructed for thermocouple calibration.
    The melting and freezing emfs coincided to within 0.02 째C, and the freezing plateau
    depression was only 0.04 째C for 45 min. The effect of the thermocouple insulator
    was examined, and the heat loss through the insulator stem was estimated to lower
    the recorded temperature about 0.6 째C below the true freezing temperature. The
    expanded uncertainty for the calibration of a type B thermocouple was calculated
    to be about 2.1 째C (<italic>k</italic> = 2). The uncertainty factor related to
    the fixed-point temperature of nickel played a major role in the combined uncertainty.
    Exact determination of the true freezing temperature of nickel on the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) will reduce this uncertainty. From the observed
    results on the melting and freezing behaviour of the nickel cell, it is suggested
    that the Ni freezing point can be used as a new primary-grade fixed point at high
    temperature.</p>"
