  content: "<p>In Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the on-board time has
    to be modelled and predicted in order to broadcast the time parameters to final
    users. As a consequence, the time prediction performance of the on-board clocks
    has to be characterized. In order to estimate the time uncertainty of the on-board
    oscillator, a linear or parabolic fit is performed over the sequence of observed
    time differences and extrapolated over the prediction period. In 1998, the French
    Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) proposed specifications of orbit determination
    and time synchronization for GNSS-2. The synchronization requirements were stated
    as the maximum acceptable error between the real time deviation of the on-board
    oscillator and its estimation predicted by extrapolating the fit. The purpose
    of this paper is to estimate this error for different types of noise. This is
    achieved by the theoretical calculation of the variances of the drift coefficients,
    of the residuals and of the extrapolation errors, in the case of quadratic and
    linear drift models affected by different types of noise. The method and its results
    are described using real data examples, and the predicted extrapolation uncertainties
    are compared with the real extrapolation errors.</p>"
