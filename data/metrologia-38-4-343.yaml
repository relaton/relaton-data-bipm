abstract:
- content: "<p>A new primary frequency standard, the atomic caesium fountain CSF1,
    has been put into operation at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB).<sup>133</sup>Cs
    atoms are cooled in a magneto-optical trap and in optical molasses. They are launched
    to a height of 39 cm above the microwave cavity centre. The resulting Ramsey resonance
    signal has a full-width half-maximum linewidth (FWHM) of 0.88 Hz. The first uncertainty
    evaluation yields a relative 1 σ frequency uncertainty of 1.4 × 10<sup>−15</sup>.
    The short-term relative frequency instability of the CSF1 for averaging time τ
    is typically 3.5 × 10<sup>−13</sup> (τ/s)<sup>−1/2,</sup> dictated by the available
    quartz oscillator as the local frequency source.</p>"
