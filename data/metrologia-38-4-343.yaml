  content: "<p>A new primary frequency standard, the atomic caesium fountain CSF1,
    has been put into operation at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB).
    <sup>133</sup>Cs atoms are cooled in a magneto-optical trap and in optical molasses.
    They are launched to a height of 39 cm above the microwave cavity centre. The
    resulting Ramsey resonance signal has a full-width half-maximum linewidth (FWHM)
    of 0.88 Hz. The first uncertainty evaluation yields a relative 1 σ frequency uncertainty
    of 1.4 × 10<sup>−15</sup>. The short-term relative frequency instability of the
    CSF1 for averaging time τ is typically 3.5 × 10<sup>−13</sup> (τ/s)<sup>−1/2,</sup>
    dictated by the available quartz oscillator as the local frequency source.</p>"
