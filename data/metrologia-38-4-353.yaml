  content: "<p>The definition of coherent derived units in the International System
    of Units (SI) is reviewed, and the important role of the equations defining physical
    quantities is emphasized in obtaining coherent derived units. In the case of the
    dimensionless quantity plane angle, the choice between alternative definitions
    is considered, leading to a corresponding choice between alternative definitions
    of the coherent derived unit - the radian, degree or revolution. In this case
    the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) has chosen to adopt the
    definition that leads to the radian as the coherent derived unit in the SI. In
    the case of the quantity logarithmic decay (or gain), also sometimes called decrement,
    and sometimes called level, a similar choice of defining equation exists, leading
    to a corresponding choice for the coherent derived unit - the neper or the bel.
    In this case the CGPM has not yet made a choice. We argue that for the quantity
    logarithmic decay the most logical choice of defining equation is linked to that
    of the radian, and is that which leads to the neper as the corresponding coherent
    derived unit. This should not prevent us from using the bel and decibel as units
    of logarithmic decay. However, it is an important part of the SI to establish
    in a formal sense the equations defining physical quantities, and the corresponding
    coherent derived units.</p>"
