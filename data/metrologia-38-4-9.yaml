abstract:
- content: "<p>A bridge for the comparison of resistance with capacitance has been
    designed and constructed. It is a six-arm generalization of the quad bridge and,
    while retaining the accuracy of a passive-component bridge, makes extensive use
    of high-precision amplifiers in both source and detector circuits. It will provide
    a link between the calculable capacitor and the ac quantum Hall resistance (QHR).</p>"
