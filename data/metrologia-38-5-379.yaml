abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is presented for evaluating the cross-spectral density diffracted
    by a circular aperture in the Fresnel approximation. Our proposal is a generalization
    to partially coherent illumination of the classical solution to the problem of
    near-field diffraction due to a circular aperture. We show that our generalization
    covers particular cases already reported in the literature and present numerical
    and experimental results that verify our proposal. This work is a contribution
    to the treatment of diffraction by multiple apertures.</p>"
