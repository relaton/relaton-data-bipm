abstract:
- content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has used the BESSY
    I 800 MeV electron storage ring as a primary source standard since 1984. The calculable
    spectral photon flux Φ<sub>E</sub> of a bending magnet with relative uncertainties
    of 4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> to 4 × 10<sup>−3</sup> for the photon energy 1 eV to 15
    keV was used in a broad spectral range from the visible to the soft X-ray range
    for the calibration of radiation sources and energy-dispersive X-ray detectors.
    In 1998, BESSY II was brought into operation. Owing to its higher electron energy,
    of 1.7 GeV, the useful spectral range could be extended significantly into the
    X-ray region up to a photon energy of about 50 keV, while special storage-ring
    operation at 900 MeV results in a spectrum up to about 7 keV. The PTB has established
    BESSY II as a European primary source standard from the visible to the X-ray range
    by setting up equipment for the measurement of all storage-ring parameters and
    geometrical quantities involved in the calculation of Φ<sub>E</sub> according
    to Schwinger. At BESSY II, Φ<sub>E</sub> from a bending magnet can be calculated
    with a relative standard uncertainty of 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for photon energies
    below 3 keV, rising to 2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> at 50 keV.</p>"
