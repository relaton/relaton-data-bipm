  content: "<p>The undispersed synchrotron radiation from bending magnets at the primary
    standard source BESSY I has been used for many years for the calibration of energy-dispersive
    X-ray detectors. It has the advantage of continuously covering a broad spectral
    range from a few electronvolts up to a few kiloelectronvolts with lower uncertainty
    of the calculated spectral photon flux than any other source in that spectral
    range. With the recent establishment of BESSY II as a primary source standard,
    the range of radiometry is further extended into the X-ray range up to about 50
    keV. In this paper we present results on the calibration of a Si(Li) detector
    at BESSY I and II. BESSY I was operated at a nominal electron energy of 800 MeV
    and BESSY II at 900 MeV and 1700 MeV. The comparison of the primary source standards
    BESSY I and II yielded perfect agreement. The relative uncertainty of the comparison
    of 0.007 is dominated by the measurement at B1. It is demonstrated that BESSY
    II operated at 1700 MeV electron energy is much more suitable for the calibration
    of energy-dispersive X-ray detectors.</p>"
