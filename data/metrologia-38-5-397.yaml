abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe some new estimates concerning the recently proposed SEE
    (Satellite Energy Exchange) experiment for measuring the gravitational interaction
    parameters in space. The experiment entails precision tracking of the relative
    motion of two test bodies (a heavy ''Shepherd'', and a light ''Particle'') on
    board a drag-free space capsule. The new estimates include (i) the sensitivity
    of Particle trajectories and G measurement to the Shepherd quadrupole moment uncertainties;
    (ii) the measurement errors of G and the strength of putative Yukawa-type force
    whose range parameter Î» may be either of the order of a few metres or close to
    the Earth radius; (iii) a possible effect of the Van Allen radiation belts on
    the SEE experiment due to test-body electric charging. The main conclusions are
    that (i) the SEE concept may allow G to be measured with an uncertainty of less
    tha 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> and progress up to two orders of magnitude is possible
    in the assessment of possible Yukawa forces and (ii) Van Allen charging of test
    bodies is a significant problem but it may be solved by existing methods.</p>"
