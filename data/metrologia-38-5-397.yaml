  content: "<p>We describe some new estimates concerning the recently proposed SEE
    (Satellite Energy Exchange) experiment for measuring the gravitational interaction
    parameters in space. The experiment entails precision tracking of the relative
    motion of two test bodies (a heavy ''Shepherd'', and a light ''Particle'') on
    board a drag-free space capsule. The new estimates include (i) the sensitivity
    of Particle trajectories and <italic>G</italic> measurement to the Shepherd quadrupole
    moment uncertainties; (ii) the measurement errors of <italic>G</italic> and the
    strength of putative Yukawa-type force whose range parameter Î» may be either of
    the order of a few metres or close to the Earth radius; (iii) a possible effect
    of the Van Allen radiation belts on the SEE experiment due to test-body electric
    charging. The main conclusions are that (i) the SEE concept may allow G to be
    measured with an uncertainty of less tha 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> and progress
    up to two orders of magnitude is possible in the assessment of possible Yukawa
    forces and (ii) Van Allen charging of test bodies is a significant problem but
    it may be solved by existing methods.</p>"
