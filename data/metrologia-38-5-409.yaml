  content: "<p>The primary frequency standard LPTF-JPO employs a caesium thermal beam,
    and optical pumping techniques. We present the main parts of the design. The short-term
    stability is reported, σ<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>(τ) = 3.5 × 10<sup>−13</sup>
    τ<sup>−1/2</sup>, where τ is the averaging time. The general expression for frequency
    shift for a square-wave frequency modulation is given. We discuss the determination
    of each frequency shift, and we present new methods to evaluate some of them.
    A relative combined standard uncertainty of 6.4 × 10<sup>−15</sup> (1 σ) is obtained.</p>"
