  content: "<p>We develop a comprehensive approach to the evaluation of the uncertainty
    of a primary frequency standard. Indirect, model-dependent means are employed
    for the evaluation of all known biases. This approach leads to a lower combined
    standard uncertainty (CSU) and leaves frequency measurements under altered conditions
    as a powerful search technique for unknown biases. We report the results of this
    evaluation technique applied to NIST-7, one of the United States' primary frequency
    standards. The best CSU value we have reported to the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures (BIPM) is 5 × 10<sup>−15</sup>, while a vigorous application
    of this evaluation process would suggest that a limiting Type B uncertainty of
    3.5 × 10<sup>−15</sup> is possible. We discuss this difference and the implications
    of reporting optimistic values. We also discuss the history of reported evaluations
    of NIST-7 including those made before the full implementation of the techniques
    presented here.</p>"
