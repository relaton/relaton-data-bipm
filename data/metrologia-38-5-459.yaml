abstract:
- content: "<p>The working equation of a capillary viscometer, used generally in the
    form ν = kν − B/τ (where ν is kinematic viscosity; τ is outflow time; k and B
    are viscometer constants), can be deduced directly from the Navier-Stokes equation.
    The surface tension only affects the k parameter. For a Ubbelohde-type viscometer
    with suspended level, the curvature of the meniscus, which compensates the influence
    of the mean surface tension, has been calculated. The relation often used for
    the capillary pressure in tubes, p<sub>σ</sub> = 2σ/R, is only approximately valid
    for radii R &lt; 0.3 mm. The Knibbs method, which uses external variable pressure,
    provides a means of calibrating viscometers to high accuracy using only one reference
    liquid.</p>"
