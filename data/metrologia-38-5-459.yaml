  content: "<p>The working equation of a capillary viscometer, used generally in the
    form ν = <italic>k</italic>ν − <italic>B</italic>/τ (where ν is kinematic viscosity;
    τ is outflow time; <italic>k</italic> and <italic>B</italic> are viscometer constants),
    can be deduced directly from the Navier-Stokes equation. The surface tension only
    affects the <italic>k</italic> parameter. For a Ubbelohde-type viscometer with
    suspended level, the curvature of the meniscus, which compensates the influence
    of the mean surface tension, has been calculated. The relation often used for
    the capillary pressure in tubes, <italic>p</italic><sub>σ</sub> = 2σ/<italic>R</italic>,
    is only approximately valid for radii <italic>R</italic> &lt; 0.3 mm. The Knibbs
    method, which uses external variable pressure, provides a means of calibrating
    viscometers to high accuracy using only one reference liquid.</p>"
