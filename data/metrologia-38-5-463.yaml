abstract:
- content: "<p>The national metrology institutes of the United Kingdom (NPL), France
    (LCIE), the United States (NIST), and the Russian Federation (VNIIFTRI) have completed
    an international comparison of radio frequency (rf) power measurement capability
    in rectangular waveguide R-400 (WR-22). Each laboratory measured the effective
    efficiency and reflection coefficient of the same bolometric power sensors in
    the frequency range from 33 GHz to 50 GHz in 1 GHz steps. This paper summarizes
    the results of this comparison.</p>"
