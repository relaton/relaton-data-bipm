  content: "<p>A high-precision comparison of dc voltages generated by a 10 GHz SINIS
    (superconductor/insulator/normal/insulator/superconductor) Josephson non-hysteretic
    junction array and a 70 GHz SIS (superconductor/insulator/superconductor) Josephson
    junction array is described. The paper also describes a method of minimizing the
    Type A measurement uncertainty. The measurements were carried out at the 10 mV
    level. The agreement between both output voltages was determined to 0.2 nV with
    a Type A uncertainty of 0.5 nV.</p>"
