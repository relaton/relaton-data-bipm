abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of a bilateral comparison of 10 V Josephson array voltage
    standards of the Ulusal Metroloji Enstitüsü (TÜBTAK-UME, Turkey) and the Bureau
    National de Métrologie-Laboratoire Central des Industries Électriques (BNM-LCIE,
    France), in the framework of EUROMET Project No. 469, are reported. A set of four
    Zener-diode-based voltage reference standards (Fluke 732B), delivered by the UME,
    was used as a transfer standard between the two laboratories. The results show
    an agreement within 97 nV with an overall uncertainty (1 σ) of 98 nV.</p>"
