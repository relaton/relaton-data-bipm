  content: "<p>Measurement capabilities of national metrology institutes (NMIs) are
    being analysed with respect to a reference value (the key comparison reference
    value, KCRV) based on measurement data obtained during the key comparison. Thus
    the KCRV is correlated with the data of the contributing laboratories. As rigorous
    treatments of correlations are not routinely presented, a simplified approach
    to quantifying these inevitable correlations is appropriate. We discuss one method
    of analysis that neatly quantifies these effects and is particularly easy to describe
    to all end users, even those not adept with correlation analysis. Each laboratory's
    result is compared with the KCRV, in whichever way it is calculated (mean, weighted
    mean, median, etc.), recomputed including only the other laboratories but excluding
    itself. Exclusive statistics provide a simple procedure for examining candidate
    KCRV methods to ensure that the correlations introduced by the KCRV have been
    properly considered.</p>"
