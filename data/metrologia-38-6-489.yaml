abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method is proposed for comparing measurements obtained in different
    laboratories when the values are correlated by low-frequency noise of the measured
    device. A minimum variance estimate for the value of the artefact standard during
    each measurement is calculated from the other masurement values using the real
    noise characteristics of the standard. This method solves the problem of proper
    Type A uncertainty treatment as it can deal with any type of noise in a straightforward
    manner. Results applicable to white, 1/f and 1/f<sup>2</sup> noise are presented
    as examples.</p><p>The minimum variance method eliminates self-correlation caused
    by the use of a single reference value. When compared with the use of a single
    reference value, the method provides a more optimal and impartial analysis of
    the results of comparisons in which the fundamental noise limit of the transfer
    standard is approached. Measurements with Zener voltage standards confirm the
    predictions of the model for 1/f noise.</p>"
