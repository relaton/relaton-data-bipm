abstract:
- content: "<p>The primary clocks CS1, CS2 and CS3, and the new fountain clock CSF1
    of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) have contributed to the realization
    of International Atomic Time (TAI) in 2000. With emphasis on the CSF1, operational
    data of the clocks are given together with the uncertainty with which they realized
    the second as defined in the International System of Units (SI). Results of comparisons
    of the realized second with the TAI scale unit are reported.</p>"
