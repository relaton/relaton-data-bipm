  content: "<p>A resistance standard, comprising three 200 k resistors mounted in
    a temperature-controlled enclosure, has been constructed from commercial high-precision
    metal-foil resistors. The standard is intended for transfer of resistance value
    between a multifrequency resistance-capacitance (R-C) bridge and an ac quantum
    Hall resistance (QHR) bridge. The three resistors were fully characterized for
    their voltage dependence.</p>"
