  content: "<p>The CCQM-K2 key comparison involved nine national metrology institutes
    (NMIs) which measured the Cd and Pb content in natural river water. The study
    was coordinated by the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM,
    Geel, Belgium) of the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. The comparison
    was run in parallel with the interlaboratory comparison IMEP-9 of trace elements
    in water, using the same sample. All participants used isotope dilution mass spectrometry
    (IDMS) as the measurement method. Good agreement of results (especially for Cd
    measurements) was obtained, bearing out conclusions from previous studies on simpler
    matrices and higher amount concentrations. Key comparison reference values and
    degree of equivalence statements are calculated as required by the Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM).</p>"
