abstract:
- content: "<p>Electrolytic conductivity measurements at the Danish Institute of Fundamental
    Metrology (DFM), the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST), and the Hungarian National Office of Measures (OMH) were compared using
    solutions of potassium chloride in water with nominal conductivities of 10 mS/m,
    100 mS/m, and 1 S/m at 25 °C. Each participant determined the conductivities of
    the solutions by the method of their choice and reported uncertainties that were
    calculated according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Secondary methods
    were used. The values determined by each institute for all three solutions agree
    within the stated uncertainties reported by the participants.</p>"
