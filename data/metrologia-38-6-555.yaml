  content: "<p>A set of fixed points maintained by national metrology institutes (NMIs)
    for calibrating platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) in Canada (National Research
    Council, NRC), Argentina (Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Industrial, INTI) and
    Brazil (Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Normalizaçãoe Qualidade Industrial,
    INMETRO) were compared using two methods. A set of portable cells was used in
    one method, and in the other a calibrated PRT. The fixed-point differences were
    as follows. For the INTI the differences Δ<italic>T</italic> = <italic>T</italic>(INTI)
    − <italic>T</italic>(NRC) found at the Ag, Al, Zn, Sn, In, Ga and Hg points were
    3.5 mK, 2.8 mK, 1.8 mK, −0.5 mK, 0.2 mK, −0.2 mK and −0.5 mK, respectively. For
    the INMETRO the differences Δ<italic>T</italic> = <italic>T</italic>(INMETRO)
    − <italic>T</italic>(NRC) at the above fixed points are 0.7 mK, 3.3 mK, −1.3 mK,
    −1.9 mK, −0.3 mK, −0.1 mK, −0.4 mK, respectively, and 0.8 mK at the Ar point.</p>"
