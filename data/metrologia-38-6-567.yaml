  content: "<p>A frequency comparison was carried out of iodine-stabilized Nd:YAG
    lasers from the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), the National
    Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM, Japan, now the National Metrology Institute
    of Japan, NMIJ) and the Bureau National de Métrologie-Institut National de Métrologie
    (BNM-INM, France). Frequency reproducibility between lasers as well as for each
    system was investigated. Pressure- and modulation-induced frequency shifts were
    studied. A frequency dispersion (1 σ) of 1500 Hz (2.6 × 10<sup>−12</sup> in relative
    terms) with an average reproducibility of 250 Hz (4.3 × 10<sup>−13</sup> in relative
    terms) was observed over the duration of the comparison. Results of stability
    measurements are given. Those obtained with the third-harmonic technique are especially
    encouraging in view of its performance and relative simplicity.</p>"
