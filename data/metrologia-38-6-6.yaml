abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reviews the theoretical motivation for the leap second in
    the context of the historical evolution of time measurement. The periodic insertion
    of a leap second step into the scale of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) necessitates
    frequent changes in complex timekeeping systems and is currently the subject of
    discussion in working groups of various international scientific organizations.
    UTC is an atomic time scale that agrees in rate with International Atomic Time
    (TAI), but differs by an integral number of seconds, and is the basis of civil
    time. In contrast, Universal Time (UT1) is an astronomical time scale defined
    by the Earth's rotation and is used in celestial navigation. UTC is presently
    maintained to within 0.9 s of UT1. As the needs of celestial navigation that depend
    on UT1 can now be met by satellite systems, such as the Global Positioning System
    (GPS), options for revising the definition of UTC and the possible role of leap
    seconds in the future are considered.</p>"
