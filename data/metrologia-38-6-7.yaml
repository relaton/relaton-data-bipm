abstract:
- content: "<p>The restrictions inherent in the use of the conventional reference
    in capillary viscometry, the viscosity of water at 20 °C, have led to increased
    interest in absolute viscometers. The viscosity laboratory of the Bureau National
    de Métrologie, Laboratoire National d'Essais (BNM-LNE) has begun the study of
    an absolute falling-ball viscometer. The principal difficulties with this system
    are the measurement of the velocity of the ball and the corrections to compensate
    for the effects exercised on the ball. Results from a preliminary experiment indicate
    that uncertainties better than those of capillary viscometers can be obtained.
    The use of a velocity measurement video system should further reduce the uncertainties.</p>"
