abstract:
- content: <p>A magnetic susceptometer developed at the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM) is used by many national laboratories to determine the magnetic
    properties of stainless-steel mass standards. This device relies on a small, cylindrical
    magnet to simulate a magnetic point dipole. According to simple theoretical considerations,
    (a) the uncertainty in the magnetic moment contributes weakly to the combined
    uncertainty of any measured susceptibility provided that unknowns are measured
    relative to a standard of similar size; (b) a cylindrical magnet with a height-to-diameter
    ratio of 0.87 best approximates a point dipole; and (c) the magnetic moment of
    the cylindrical magnet used can be determined by the susceptometer itself. Experimental
    tests of these assertions are presented. The properties of the cylindrical magnet
    generally become more important when determining the susceptibility of "small"-sized
    samples relative to a "large" standard. Small samples provide additional challenges,
    which are discussed in the context of a more general uncertainty analysis.</p>
