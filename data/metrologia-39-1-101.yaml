abstract:
- content: "<p>Two publications on interferometric gauge block measurements claiming
    extraordinarily low uncertainties gave rise to some critical considerations. For
    such interferometric measurements, wringing of the gauge block to a platen is
    a basic element in the measurement process. Among the effects limiting the attainable
    uncertainty level, the elastic deformation of the gauge block by the wringing
    process has to be included in the evaluation model and to be appropriately taken
    into account in the uncertainty budget.</p>"
