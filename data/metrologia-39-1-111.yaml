  content: "<p>From 1 January 2002 the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB),
    the national metrology institute of Germany, will make a change in the realization
    of the gray which will affect calibrations performed in terms of air kerma in
    the fields of <sup>60</sup>Co and <sup>137</sup>Cs. For a given detector, the
    calibration factor will be increased by 0.95 % and 0.85 % in the fields of <sup>60</sup>Co
    and <sup>137</sup>Cs, respectively.</p>"
