  content: "<p>The photometric standards for luminous intensity and luminous flux
    held at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) consist of two groups
    of lamps. The values ascribed to these standards are derived from the mean values
    of the most recent international comparisons of national photometric standards.
    Following the recent key comparisons organized under the auspices of the Consultative
    Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR), CCPR-K3.a for luminous intensity
    and CCPR-K4 for luminous flux, the International Committee for Weights and Measures
    (CIPM) decided in 2001 that the values ascribed to the BIPM standards should be
    adjusted to bring them into agreement with the reference values of these comparisons.</p>"
