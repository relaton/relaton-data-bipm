  content: '<p>Laboratory comparisons of artefact standards may follow a "star-shaped"
    sequence ABACA... or a "round-robin" sequence ABC...A, where A is the pilot laboratory.
    For each of these sequences, two analysis procedures are described: "overall constant
    drift" (OCD) and "separately fitted lines" (SFL). SFL is well suited to cases
    where there are changes in artefact drift, or transportation shifts. With the
    round-robin sequence, both OCD and SFL in particular assign different uncertainties
    to laboratories'' realizations of a physical unit, depending on the laboratories''
    positions in the sequence, and also induce significant interlaboratory correlations.
    These disadvantages are less pronounced with the star sequence, where SFL in particular
    assigns equal uncertainties regardless of position in the sequence.</p>'
