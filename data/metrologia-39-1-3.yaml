  content: "<p>The ac quantum Hall resistance of several GaAs-based samples has been
    investigated. The influence of temperature, current and frequency was measured
    for the plateau <italic>i</italic> = 2. Some measurements were performed for the
    plateau <italic>i</italic> = 4 in order to determine the scaling behaviour with
    respect to <italic>i</italic>. The plateau edge is shown to depend on the electronic
    temperature and the current at the plateau edge is distributed over the whole
    width of the sample. At the plateau centre, edge-current effects become apparent
    which depend on how close the filling factor is to an integer value. The losses
    of these edge currents cause the ac quantum Hall resistance to differ from the
    dc quantum Hall resistance.</p>"
