abstract:
- content: <p>The ac quantum Hall resistance measured with frequencies in the range
    of a few kilohertz shows characteristic deviations from the dc quantum Hall resistance.
    These deviations indicate ac losses which increase linearly with frequency. To
    investigate these losses, a Hall bar with an inner and an outer "window" has been
    tested. When external voltages are supplied to the windows, the ac losses can
    be adjusted to zero. This is explained by a phenomenological model for the current
    distribution in the Hall bar and leads to a model for the ac losses.</p>
