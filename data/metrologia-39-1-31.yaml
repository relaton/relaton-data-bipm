abstract:
- content: "<p>The comparison of mass standards in air generally requires air buoyancy
    corrections. To determine these corrections it is necessary to estimate the density
    of moist air inside the balance case during the weighing procedure. The relative
    combined standard uncertainty of the air density determination is about 10<sup>−4</sup>
    when using the CIPM-81/91 formula. The aim of our present work is to reduce the
    air density uncertainty using other methods and the purpose of this paper is to
    compare the performance of the following three methods: (a) application of the
    CIPM-81/91 formula (absolute determination); (b) direct determination using air
    buoyancy artefacts having the same surface area but a large volume difference
    (absolute determination); (c) refractometry, exploiting the high correlation between
    air density and air index of refraction using a novel refractometer well adapted
    to our requirements (relative determination). So far, the coherence between the
    three methods is satisfactory; the response characteristics for the three determinations
    are comparable and the agreement between the air density determinations is within
    1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> kg m<sup>−3</sup>. A discrepancy of the order of 10<sup>−4</sup>
    kg m<sup>−3</sup> is observed between the CIPM-81/91 formula and artefact methods.
    This difference needs to be clarified by future measurements. The relative combined
    standard uncertainty obtained on the air density determination when using the
    air buoyancy artefacts is about 7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>"
