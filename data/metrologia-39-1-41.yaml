abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) has only recently
    been realized below 4.2 K at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). As
    the NRC Thermometry Group lacked a cryostat capable of reaching 0.65 K, the helium
    vapour-pressure thermometer was designed to fit the demanding geometry of a top-loading<sup>3</sup>He
    cryostat insert routinely used by the Electrical Standards Group to realize the
    resistance unit by means of the quantized Hall resistance. The vapour-pressure
    apparatus has been operated successfully from 0.7 K to 4 K in the<sup>3</sup>He
    cryostat and from 2.3 K to 4.2 K in a<sup>4</sup>He cryostat. The resistance-temperature
    data pairs obtained for the RhFe thermometers over the 0.7 K to 4.2 K range, using
    the temperature derived from vapour-pressure measurements for both<sup>3</sup>He
    and<sup>4</sup>He, were fitted to sixth-degree polynomials. The residuals from
    the fits were within Â±0.3 mK for both thermometers.</p>"
