  content: "<p>The International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) has only recently
    been realized below 4.2 K at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). As
    the NRC Thermometry Group lacked a cryostat capable of reaching 0.65 K, the helium
    vapour-pressure thermometer was designed to fit the demanding geometry of a top-loading
    <sup>3</sup>He cryostat insert routinely used by the Electrical Standards Group
    to realize the resistance unit by means of the quantized Hall resistance. The
    vapour-pressure apparatus has been operated successfully from 0.7 K to 4 K in
    the <sup>3</sup>He cryostat and from 2.3 K to 4.2 K in a <sup>4</sup>He cryostat.
    The resistance-temperature data pairs obtained for the RhFe thermometers over
    the 0.7 K to 4.2 K range, using the temperature derived from vapour-pressure measurements
    for both <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He, were fitted to sixth-degree polynomials.
    The residuals from the fits were within Â±0.3 mK for both thermometers.</p>"
