  content: "<p>A modification of a measure of consistency frequently used in the literature
    is discussed. The modification explicitly takes into account the influence of
    the connection between the single results and the comparison reference value,
    where the latter is derived from the values of the current series of measurements.
    This is of particular importance in situations in which the weighted mean is taken
    as the reference value.</p>"
