  content: "<p>The transient hot-wire technique is re-investigated in order to measure,
    simultaneously and accurately, the thermal conductivity λ and thermal diffusivity
    κ of a liquid. Newly derived effective temperatures <italic>T</italic><sub>λ</sub>
    and <italic>T</italic><sub>κ</sub> that are associated with the measured values
    of the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity are introduced and replace
    the previously used temperatures <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>.
    Higher-order corrections due to the thermal properties of the wire material are
    also re-investigated; these may be significant for experiments on lower-density
    substances or when using a hot-wire sensor with a thicker wire. The radiation
    (photons) emitted from or absorbed into the medium is discussed, and its contribution
    is taken to be part of the ordinary heat-conduction phenomenon exhibited by carriers
    such as phonons, electrons and molecules. The new system was tested by measuring
    the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of n-heptane, n-pentane and iso-pentane,
    and values for their volumic heat capacities were calculated from the ratios λ/κ.
    The relative combined expanded uncertainties of the measured values (coverage
    factor <italic>k</italic> = 2) were 0.38 % for λ, and 1.7 % for κ and <italic>c</italic><sub>p</sub>ρ.</p>"
