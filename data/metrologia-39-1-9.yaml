abstract:
- content: "<p>The transient hot-wire technique is re-investigated in order to measure,
    simultaneously and accurately, the thermal conductivity λ and thermal diffusivity
    κ of a liquid. Newly derived effective temperatures  T<sub>λ</sub> and  T<sub>κ</sub>
    that are associated with the measured values of the thermal conductivity and thermal
    diffusivity are introduced and replace the previously used temperatures  T<sub>0</sub>
    and  T<sub>m</sub>. Higher-order corrections due to the thermal properties of
    the wire material are also re-investigated; these may be significant for experiments
    on lower-density substances or when using a hot-wire sensor with a thicker wire.
    The radiation (photons) emitted from or absorbed into the medium is discussed,
    and its contribution is taken to be part of the ordinary heat-conduction phenomenon
    exhibited by carriers such as phonons, electrons and molecules. The new system
    was tested by measuring the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of n-heptane,
    n-pentane and iso-pentane, and values for their volumic heat capacities were calculated
    from the ratios λ/κ. The relative combined expanded uncertainties of the measured
    values (coverage factor  k  = 2) were 0.38 % for λ, and 1.7 % for κ and  c<sub>p</sub>ρ.</p>"
