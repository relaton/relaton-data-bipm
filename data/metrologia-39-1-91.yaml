abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM), the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB), Measurement Canada (MC), and the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) maintain the national primary standard facilities for the
    measurement of volume in Mexico, Germany, Canada and the United States, respectively.
    These laboratories have compared volume measurements at 50 l. The comparison was
    accomplished by each laboratory calibrating a transfer standard volume that was
    circulated among the laboratories, with the CENAM acting as pilot laboratory.
    All the participants used gravimetric methods. The maximum and minimum reported
    volumes differ by 0.0098 %.</p>"
