abstract:
- content: "<p>The accurate weighing of gas into high-pressure cylinders plays a central
    role in providing traceability for primary gas mixtures. The uncertainties in
    the masses of successive components added to such mixtures are significantly correlated.
    We show that a consequence is that the amount fraction of the resulting mixture
    is not influenced by changes in buoyancy due to the linear expansion of the cylinder.
    This result will provide a useful simplification to some procedures used in gas
    metrology</p>"
