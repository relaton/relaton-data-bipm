  content: "<p>An international comparison of dc resistance at 10 MΩ and 1 GΩ was
    organized under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Electricity and
    Magnetism (CCEM) and piloted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST, USA). This CCEM comparison began in August 1996 and was completed in March
    2000 with the participation of fourteen other national metrology institutes (NMIs).
    The travelling package included three wirewound 10 MΩ standards and three film-type
    1 GΩ standards designed by the NIST. Results indicate that the differences at
    10 MΩ and 1 GΩ between each laboratory's values and the respective reference value,
    are all within each laboratory's expanded relative uncertainty at a coverage factor
    \ <italic>k</italic> = 2.</p>"
