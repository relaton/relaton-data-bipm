    <p>This report describes key comparison CCEM-K6.a of ac-dc voltage transfer standards at the lowest
    level of uncertainty, held under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism
    (CCEM) and completed in May 1996. Twenty-two national metrology institutes (NMIs) took part in this
    comparison, which concentrated on the basic voltage level of 3 V and a frequency of 1 kHz. Results for
    additional optional frequencies, such as 20 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz, were also reported by most of the NMIs. Multijunction thermal converters (three-dimensional MJTCs and a planar MJTC) manufactured at the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (pilot laboratory) were used as travelling standards. All the results
    show agreement with the reference value within the expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) given by each participant. The expanded uncertainties associated with the reference value are 0.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 1 kHz, 0.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 20 kHz, 1.0 × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 100 kHz and 6.7 × 10<sup>-6</sup> at 1 MHz. Degrees of equivalence with the reference value are given.</p>
