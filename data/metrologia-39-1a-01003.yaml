    <p>Comparison of electrical standards must be carried out periodically between national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) to establish the relationship between their practical electrical units. This report describes a key comparison between the practical capacitance units of ten NMIs from four regional metrology organizations (APMP, COOMET, EUROMET, SIM), and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, organized from 1996 to 1998 by the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM). As pilot laboratory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology was responsible for providing and preparing the standards as well as for collecting and analysing the data and preparing the draft reports. Although there were a few differences between capacitance units, for the majority of participants the results show agreement within the 95 % confidence level.</p>
