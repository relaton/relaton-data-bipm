    <p>The results of two key comparisons of 10 pF capacitance, CCEM-K4 and EUROMET.EM-K4, are
    linked by means of the results of six of the laboratories that participated in both comparisons. The linking
    process yields degrees of equivalence with respect to the key comparison reference value (derived from CCEMK4) and the pairwise degrees of equivalence between the participants in both comparisons.</p>
