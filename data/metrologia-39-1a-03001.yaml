    <p>This report describes key comparison CCT-K4 held under the auspices of the Consultative
    Committee for Thermometry (CCT). For the first time, local realizations of ITS-90 temperatures were
    compared by directly circulating aluminium and silver freezing-point cells. Twelve national metrology
    institutes (BNM/INM, IMGC, KRISS, NIM, NIST, NMIJ, NMi/VSL, NML, NPL, NRC, PTB, VNIIM),
    organized into three subgroups, American, European and Asian/Australian, contributed to the results. The
    American subgroup used an exemplary bilateral and the other subgroups a round-robin procedure. Key
    comparison reference values (KCRV) for both freezing points were calculated as the weighted average
    temperatures using the squared sum of the combined standard uncertainties of the laboratories and an
    uncertainty representing the stability of the circulated cells to set the weights. For the aluminium freezing
    point, the absolute temperature differences from the corresponding KCRV varied between 0.13 mK and
    4.35 mK with expanded uncertainties between 1.08 mK and 4.16 mK (95 % level of confidence). For the silver freezing point, the absolute differences ranged from 0.74 mK to 13.03 mK and the expanded uncertainties were between 1.01 mK and 12.89 mK.</p>
