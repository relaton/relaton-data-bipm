- content: |-
    <p>Since 1978, five national metrology institutes and one other laboratory have submitted eight samples
    of known activity of<sup>144</sup>Ce to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 2 MBq to 8 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given. The results of this comparison have been approved by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ce-144.</p>
