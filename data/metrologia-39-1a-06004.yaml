- content: |-
    <p>Since 1982, two national metrology institutes (NMIs) have contributed two results of known activity
    of<sup>207</sup>Bi to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 500 kBq to 1.2 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between the two NMIs determined from the equivalent activity measured in the SIR have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix. The results of this comparison have been approved by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Bi-207.</p>
