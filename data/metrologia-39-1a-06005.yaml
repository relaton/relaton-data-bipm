abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1979, five national metrology institutes have submitted six samples
    of known activity of<sup>141</sup>Ce to the International Reference System (SIR)
    for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The
    activities ranged from about 3 MBq to 23 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between
    each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix.
    A graphical presentation is also given. The results of this comparison have been
    approved by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)),
    comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ce-141.</p>"
