- content: |-
    <p>Since 1980, two national metrology institutes, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, USA), and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK), have contributed two results of known activity of<sup>154</sup>Eu to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 200 kBq to 1.1 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given. The results of this comparison have been approved by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Eu-154.</p>
