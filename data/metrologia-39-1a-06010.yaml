    <p>A  personal  dose  equivalent  comparison  was  carried  out  between  the  BEV  and  the  PTB  using  a
    direct-reading electronic dosemeter system as a transfer instrument. This was the first comparison for the `new' operational quantity,  H<sub>p</sub>(10), for individual monitoring of strongly penetrating radiation and was performed in the preparatory stage of the European co-operation for Accreditation interlaboratory comparison IR4. For the BEV-PTB  comparison  described  in  this  paper,  the  ISO  water  slab  phantom  and  the  ISO  radiation  qualities N-60 to N-300, S-Cs and S-Co were selected, whereby the axes of the radiation fields were perpendicular to the  phantom  surface.  The  results  show  very  good  agreement.  In  addition,  the  properties  of  the  dosemeter system were investigated.</p>
