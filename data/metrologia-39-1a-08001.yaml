    <p>A key comparison on the determination of total cholesterol in human serum, organized by the
    Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM), was carried out in 2001. To address the
    measurement traceability needs of the clinical chemistry community, the CCQM is undertaking key comparisons to document the capabilities of national metrology institutes (NMIs) that provide measurement services in this area. This key comparison, along with two others in progress, CCQM-K11 and CCQM-K12 (determination of glucose and creatinine, respectively, in serum), will provide a basis for evaluating the capabilities of NMIs for the determination of well-defined, organic substances of similar molecular weights and concentrations in human serum.</p><p>Participants in CCQM-K6 were the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA, pilot
    laboratory); Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC, UK); National Analytical Reference Laboratory (NARL, Australia); National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ, Japan); National Research Center for Certified Reference Materials (NRCCRM, China); Nederlands Meetinstituut, Van Swinden Laboratorium (NMi-VSL, Netherlands); and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany). Two frozen samples of human serum were sent to each of the participants for the determination of cholesterol using ID-GC/MS-based methods. Agreement of results among the participants was generally good, with a few exceptions. Based on these results and those of an earlier pilot study, it is clear that experience with this measurement is critical to the achievement of high accuracy and precision.</p><p>In conclusion, most of the NMIs that participated demonstrated the ability to make accurate and precise
    measurements of serum cholesterol and are therefore capable of providing high-order traceability for this
    measurand.</p>
