    <p>This report describes a key comparison of cadmium and lead amount content in sediment, organized
    in 2000 by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of
    Substance (CCQM) and piloted by the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Geel,
    Belgium). The majority of the fourteen participating national metrology institutes (NMIs) applied isotope
    dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) using various mass spectrometry techniques. External standard calibration was used by two of the NMIs for the Cd measurement and by one of them for the Pb measurement. The results showed satisfactory agreement. The key comparison reference value was agreed as the median of the reported results, excluding those of two participants for the Cd measurement, and degree of equivalence statements are given.</p>
