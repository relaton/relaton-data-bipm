    <p>The  aim  of  this  key  comparison  was  to  compare  capabilities  for  the  preparation  and  value
    assignment of gas mixture standards for benzene, toluene,  <italic>m</italic>-xylene,   <italic>o</italic>-xylene  and  ethylbenzene  in  nitrogen (subsequently  referred  to  as  BTX),  maintained  at  national  metrology  institutes  (NMIs).  The  range  of  the nominal  amount-of-substance  fractions  of  the  comparison  standard  is  50 nmol/mol  to  100 nmol/mol,  higher than regulations in most countries for permitted ambient quantities. Another BTX comparison (CCQM-K10) is planned to test the amount-of-substance fraction of 5 nmol/mol to 10 nmol/mol, which is closer to regulatory levels.  Eight  NMIs  participated  in  CCQM-K7.  As  pilot  laboratory,  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and Technology (NIST, USA) prepared two 30 L primary standard gas mixtures of BTX in nitrogen using normal gravimetric  procedures.  Eight  6 L  aluminium  cylinders  were  filled  from  these  parent  cylinders  for  the comparison study. Each participating laboratory was shipped one 6 L cylinder to be analysed and then returned to  the  NIST,  which  reanalysed  the  cylinder contents to verify whether the compounds had remained  stable throughout the comparison. Although there were indications that the gas mixture was unstable in some of the cylinders, the results indicated that agreement for a majority of the participants was within 5 % relative. The largest deviations were associated with the analysis of ethylbenzene, probably due to lack of experience with this compound. Ethylbenzene is not regulated in most countries, and thus not normally analysed on a routine
    basis.  The  relatively  high  concentration  of mixtures  used  in  this  comparison  may  also  have  caused  higher deviations.  Normal  analytical  methods  in  current  use  are  optimized  for  the  1 nmol/mol  to  10 nmol/mol concentration range, and therefore the higher concentrations were outside the optimum range for analysis.</p>
