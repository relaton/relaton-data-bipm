    <p>The  aim  of  this  key  comparison  was  to  compare  capabilities  for  the  preparation  and  value
    assignment of gas mixture standards for benzene, toluene and  <italic>o</italic>-xylene in nitrogen (subsequently referred to as BTX), maintained at national metrology institutes (NMIs).  The  range  of  the  nominal  amount-of-substance fractions of the comparison standard is 5 nmol/mol to 10 nmol/mol, which is close to regulatory levels in most countries. Eight NMIs participated in CCQM-K10. As pilot laboratory, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) prepared two 30 L primary standard gas mixtures of BTX in nitrogen using normal gravimetric  procedures.  Eight  6 L  aluminium  cylinders  were  filled  from  these  parent  cylinders for the comparison study. Each participating laboratory was shipped one 6 L cylinder to be analysed and then returned to  the  NIST,  which  reanalysed  the  cylinder contents to verify whether the compounds had remained  stable throughout  the  comparison.  All  the  participants  had  results  that  were  within  5 %  of  the  relevant  reference values  except  for  one value  for  <italic>o</italic>-xylene,  which was  biased  by  10 %  relative  to  the  reference value. At  this concentration level, these results are considered to be within acceptable limits.</p>
