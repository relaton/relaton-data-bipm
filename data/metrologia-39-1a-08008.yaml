    <p>This key comparison involved primary standards of ethanol in air maintained at eight laboratories.
    The nominal amount fraction of the standards used for the comparison was 120 Âµmol/mol, which is typical of the levels used to calibrate evidential breath analysers in many countries. Such standards fulfil the agreed requirements of the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) for the calibration of evidential breath-alcohol analysers and can provide a more accurate calibration at field level than ethanol/water solution-based simulators, which have a high sensitivity to variations in the temperature of the solution. EUROMET.QM-K4 results are linked to CCQM-K4 results.</p>
