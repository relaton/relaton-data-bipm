    <p>Nine national metrology institutes participated in CIPM key comparison CCAUV.U-K1 (ultrasonic
    power), with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Braunschweig, Germany) acting as pilot laboratory,
    between 1999 and 2001. The transfer standard was an ultrasonic source transducer based on a lithium niobate crystal, and the electric input voltage to the transducer and the ultrasonic output power emitted into an anechoic water volume were measured. The technical protocol specified three frequencies in the megahertz range and five excitation levels. The measurement methods are described and the results given with their associated uncertainties. The participants' relative expanded uncertainties for the ultrasonic power or equivalent quantities at the various frequencies and excitation levels range from 1.8 × 10<sup>-2</sup> to 20.9 × 10<sup>-2</sup> (95 % level of confidence). Key comparison reference values and degrees of equivalence are given. The agreement between the results is generally satisfactory, and in some cases excellent.</p>
