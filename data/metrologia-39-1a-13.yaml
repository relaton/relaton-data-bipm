abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>In 1980, a national metrology institute, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now the National
    Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology,  NIST,  USA),  submitted  a  sample  of  known  activity  of<sup>195</sup>Au to  the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The value of the activity submitted was about 1.8 MBq. The result of this comparison has been approved by Section  II  of  the  Consultative  Committee  for  Ionizing  Radiation  (CCRI(II)),  comparison  identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Au-195.</p>
