    <p>A key comparison of low differential pressure standards, organized under the auspices of the
    Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM), was carried out at four national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) between July 1998 and May 1999 in order to determine the degrees of equivalence of the
    standards at pressures in the range 1 Pa to 1000 Pa. The differential pressures were superimposed on a line
    pressure of nominally 100 kPa. The primary standards, which represent two principal measurement methods,
    included three liquid-column manometers and one double pressure balance. The transfer standard package
    consisted of four high-precision pressure transducers: two capacitance diaphragm gauges to provide high
    resolution at low differential pressures, and two resonant silicon gauges to provide the required calibration
    stability. Two nominally identical transfer packages were used to reduce the time required for the
    measurements, with Package A being circulated among laboratories in the European region (Istituto di
    Metrologia G. Colonnetti, Italy; National Physical Laboratory, UK) and Package B in the Asia-Pacific region
    (Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand). The results obtained were normalized using data
    obtained from simultaneous calibrations of the two packages at the pilot laboratory (National Institute of
    Standards and Technology, USA). The degrees of equivalence of the measurement standards were determined in two ways: deviations from key comparison reference values and pairwise differences between these deviations. The differential pressure standards of the participants were generally found to be equivalent and the results revealed no significant relative bias between the two principal methods tested.</p>
