    <p>This report describes a key comparison of monoelemental calibration solutions, organized under the
    auspices of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM) in 1999-2000 and piloted by the
    Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research (EMPA, Switzerland) and the Laboratoire National
    d'Essais (BNM-LNE, France). Solutions of aluminium, copper, magnesium and iron were measured. Although
    different methods of measurement were applied, most of the thirteen participating national metrology institutes achieved results within the required target range for a combined standard uncertainty of 0.5 % relative for each element. The methods used were titrimetry, coulometry, gravimetry, isotope dilution mass spectrometry and inductive coupled plasma/emission spectrometry.</p>
