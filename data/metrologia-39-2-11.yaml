abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports on an international comparison of surface-texture
    parameters, R<sub>a</sub>, R<sub>y5</sub> and R<sub>y</sub>, carried out between
    nine national metrology institutes from 1996 to 1998 under the auspices of the
    Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) and coordinated by the CSIRO National
    Measurement Laboratory (NML, Australia). The results show that the consistency
    of the Ra measurements is generally better than that of the R<sub>y5</sub> and
    R<sub>y</sub> measurements, which appear to split into two sub-groups with some
    crossover. Agreement is somewhat better for artefacts of higher surface roughness.
    Measurements of step height were also made as a potential indicator of correlation
    between the basic length scale and the surface-roughness parameters. These show
    satisfactory agreement, within the stated uncertainties and with the normalized
    error, E<sub>n</sub>, values &lt; 1 in all cases.</p>"
