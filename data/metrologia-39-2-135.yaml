  content: "<p>As part of a programme to implement scientific time and frequency metrology
    in Brazil, the caesium-beam frequency standard of the Instituto de Física de São
    Carlos has been improved in order to obtain greater accuracy. Our most recent
    evaluation shows an Allan standard deviation of σ<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>(τ)
    = (1.8 ± 0.2) × 10<sup>-11</sup>τ<sup>-0.5</sup>, corresponding to an improvement
    of two orders of magnitude over our previous evaluation. Estimates of the main
    shifts of the frequency standard, such as second-order Doppler shift, end-to-end
    cavity phase shift, and Rabi frequency value, have been performed employing two
    different methods that allow the results to be extracted from the Ramsey pattern.</p>"
