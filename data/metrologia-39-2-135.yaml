abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of a programme to implement scientific time and frequency metrology
    in Brazil, the caesium-beam frequency standard of the Instituto de Física de São
    Carlos has been improved in order to obtain greater accuracy. Our most recent
    evaluation shows an Allan standard deviation of σ<sub>y</sub>(τ) = (1.8 ± 0.2)
    × 10<sup>-11</sup>τ<sup>-0.5</sup>, corresponding to an improvement of two orders
    of magnitude over our previous evaluation. Estimates of the main shifts of the
    frequency standard, such as second-order Doppler shift, end-to-end cavity phase
    shift, and Rabi frequency value, have been performed employing two different methods
    that allow the results to be extracted from the Ramsey pattern.</p>"
