abstract:
- content: "<p>A spectrophotometer based on an integrating sphere coupled to a commercial
    Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) instrument has been constructed for regular
    spectral transmittance and reflectance measurements over the 1 µm to 18 µm wavelength
    region. Despite the large number of sources of error that often limit the radiometric
    accuracy of FTIR measurements, we demonstrate uncertainties similar to established
    dispersive instrumentation. We performed near-normal-incidence reflectance and
    transmittance measurements on a series of samples over the 1 µm to 2.5 µm wavelength
    range using both FTIR and dispersive spectrophotometers. The results are compared,
    taking into account any differences in measurement geometry among the various
    systems and the combined measurement uncertainty. We find agreement within the
    combined uncertainties over most of the measured spectral region.</p>"
