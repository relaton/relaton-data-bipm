  content: "<p>An international comparison of gauge block measurements by interferometry
    has been carried out. The comparison is part of the set of key comparisons established
    by the Consultative Committee for Length (CCL) and contributes to the mutual recognition
    of calibration certificates issued by national metrology institutes (NMIs). Eleven
    laboratories representing the four major metrology regions participated in this
    comparison, which took place in 1998/1999. The standards to be calibrated were
    ten steel gauge blocks and ten tungsten carbide gauge blocks with nominal lengths
    between 0.5 mm and 100 mm. The measurand was the central length determined by
    optical interferometry, as defined in International Standard ISO 3650. The agreement
    between the measurement results was satisfactory, the major problems encountered
    being due to the determination of the corrections, taking into account the different
    properties of the measurement surfaces and the reference platens. The arithmetic
    mean was found to be the most adequate method for calculating the key comparison
    reference values.</p>"
