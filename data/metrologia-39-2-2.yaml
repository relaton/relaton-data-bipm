abstract:
- content: "<p>Sixty-five standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) in the
    range 0 °C to 660.323 °C were investigated. The results show fifty-eight SPRTs
    with non-uniqueness less than 1.0 mK in one distribution and the remaining seven
    SPRTs with non-uniqueness much greater than 1.0 mK in a separate distribution.
    The results suggest that the non-uniqueness of the SPRTs should be controlled
    within 1 mK. The results also suggest that in the sub-range 0 °C to 419.527 °C
    non-uniqueness is determined solely by the coefficient  c  of the interpolation
    equation for SPRTs in the range 0 °C to 660.323 °C. A simple formula is given
    relating the non-uniqueness and a coefficient  c, which can be conveniently used
    to assess the quality of SPRTs.</p>"
