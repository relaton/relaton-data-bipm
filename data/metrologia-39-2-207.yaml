  content: "<p>The resistance standard maintained at the Electrotechnical Laboratory
    (ETL, Japan) is based on the resistance of the second plateau of the quantized
    Hall resistance, RH(2). A resistance ratio bridge with a cryogenic current comparator
    (CCC) is used for the measurements. The typical relative standard uncertainty
    in measuring a 1 Ω resistor is estimated to be about 4 × 10<sup>-9</sup>. The
    resistance standard maintained at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM, China)
    is based on the average value of six wire-wound 1 Ω resistors. It was monitored
    using the ETL quantum Hall effect (QHE) resistance standard in 1992, 1996 and
    2000 by bringing 1 Ω resistors from the NIM to the ETL or from the ETL to the
    NIM. The drift rate of the standard was measured to be -0.024 µΩ/year. The NIM
    has developed a CCC bridge. The typical relative standard uncertainty in measuring
    a 1 Ω resistor using this CCC bridge and the QHE system of the NIM is estimated
    to be about 7 × 10<sup>-9</sup>. The NIM QHE system was compared with the ETL
    QHE resistance standard by bringing three 1 Ω resistors from the ETL to the NIM.
    Differences in the measurements were (+3.9 ± 8.9) nΩ, (+1.0 ± 9.9) nΩ and (-0.9
    ± 9.1) nΩ, respectively.</p>"
