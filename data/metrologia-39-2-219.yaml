  content: "<p>An international comparison has been conducted to compare the illuminance
    responsivity scales (A/lx) and the units of luminous flux (lm) maintained at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) and the Helsinki University
    of Technology (HUT, Finland). Both laboratories realize the illuminance unit by
    absolutely calibrated photometers and the luminous flux unit by the absolute integrating-sphere
    method. Standard photometers were used as transfer standards for the illuminance
    responsivity comparison, and standard lamps in the luminous flux comparison. The
    ratio of the measured illuminance responsivity values (HUT/NIST) was 0.9992 with
    an expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of 0.0013, and the ratio of the
    measured luminous flux values was 1.0006 with an expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2) of 0.0018. The relative expanded uncertainties of the agreement of the units,
    including the uncertainties of the realizations of the units as well as the uncertainty
    of the comparison, were 0.0047 and 0.0101, respectively.</p>"
