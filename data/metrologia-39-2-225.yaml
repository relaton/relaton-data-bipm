  content: "<p>This paper reports on an international comparison of surface-texture
    parameters, <italic>R</italic><sub>a</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>y5</sub> and
    <italic>R</italic><sub>y</sub>, carried out between nine national metrology institutes
    from 1996 to 1998 under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP)
    and coordinated by the CSIRO National Measurement Laboratory (NML, Australia).
    The results show that the consistency of the Ra measurements is generally better
    than that of the <italic>R</italic><sub>y5</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> measurements,
    which appear to split into two sub-groups with some crossover. Agreement is somewhat
    better for artefacts of higher surface roughness. Measurements of step height
    were also made as a potential indicator of correlation between the basic length
    scale and the surface-roughness parameters. These show satisfactory agreement,
    within the stated uncertainties and with the normalized error, <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub>,
    values &lt; 1 in all cases.</p>"
