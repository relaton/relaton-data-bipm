abstract:
- content: "<p>The Czech Technical University (CTU), acting as pilot laboratory in
    an international comparison, has fabricated and provided as transfer standards
    four terminal-pair thermostatted travelling resistance standards with nominal
    values of 12906 Ω and 6453 Ω. Vishay S 102 K resistors form the resistive elements
    of these standards and 100 Ω platinum resistance thermometers make it possible
    to monitor their inner temperature. The laboratories participating in the comparison
    (five in Europe and one in Canada) were requested to measure the frequency dependences
    and time constants of the travelling standards by comparing them with resistors
    with calculable frequency performance. Calculable resistors of several different
    designs (monofilar, bifilar, quadrifilar and octofilar) were available. For both
    travelling standards, the ac-dc differences of the parallel equivalent resistance,
    as reported by the different laboratories, are within 13 parts in 108 at 500 Hz
    and 70 parts in 108 at 5000 Hz. The reported time constants differ by less than
    3.9 ns and 4.8 ns, respectively.</p>"
