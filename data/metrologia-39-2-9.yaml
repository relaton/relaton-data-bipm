abstract:
- content: "<p>The comparison of two lasers from the Slovak Institute of Metrology
    (SMU, Slovakia) and one laser from the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen
    (BEV, Austria) in March 2000 followed that undertaken by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) at the BEV in September 1999. These two comparisons
    were indirectly linked through the frequency of the BEV2 laser. As a first step,
    two SMU lasers (SMU-B2 and SMU-B3) were compared with BEV2 (in this case the reference
    laser) and then the SMU lasers were mutually compared, with the parameters of
    all three lasers set up as they are normally used. Uncorrected frequency differences
    with respect to BEV2 were -15.2 kHz (SMU-B2) and +19.7 kHz (SMU-B3), i.e. within
    the expanded uncertainty of 2 σ = 24 kHz (5 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) recommended by
    the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). Taking into account
    the correction to the recommended values of the parameters, these differences
    were reduced to -5.1 kHz and +4.6 kHz, respectively. After transfer to the BIPM
    reference laser, the differences of the SMU lasers were -7.4 kHz and +2.3 kHz,
    respectively, i.e. within the range of 1 σ = 12 kHz (2.5 × 10<sup>-11</sup>) recommended
    by the CIPM for laser parameters meeting the recommended values. The best frequency
    stabilities, expressed as relative Allan standard deviations, were 8.0 × 10<sup>-12</sup>,
    2.6 × 10<sup>-12</sup> and 9.2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> for sampling times of 10 s,
    100 s and 1000 s, respectively. The overall best value was 6.0 × 10<sup>-13</sup>
    for a sampling time of 2500 s.</p>"
