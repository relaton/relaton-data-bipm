abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a more precise method for statistical treatment
    of results of repeated measurements, based on the generalized normal distribution
    law of random errors. The paper also presents physical grounds for the adequacy
    of this distribution in the application to random errors of measurements. Statistical
    estimates of parameters and a distribution density form are theoretically substantiated.
    A procedure for treating results of repeated measurements by statistical means
    is outlined and compared with that stated in the International Organization for
    Standardization's Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The results
    obtained when evaluating this method on a number of the standards from the D.
    I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM) are given. Application of the suggested
    method may yield a significant effect where a measurement result has to be obtained
    with the maximum possible accuracy.</p>"
