  content: "<p>Static gas expansion provides a convenient primary standard for calibrating
    pressure gauges in the medium vacuum range. This paper reports on a thorough investigation
    of the fundamental principle, possible disturbances and achievable uncertainty
    of such an apparatus. The method is described and model equations for the general
    case of a non-isothermal expansion of a real gas are derived. As temperature effects
    play an essential role in the uncertainty budget, the vessels of the apparatus
    were immersed in a temperature-controlled circulating water bath. In addition,
    the inherent transient temperature effects originating from the gas expansion
    process itself were studied experimentally, which leads to a better understanding
    of these effects. As a result, uncertainties caused by temperature effects could
    be substantially reduced. Furthermore, deviations between different real gases
    were studied. The investigations led to greater accuracy of the primary standard
    apparatus, i.e. an expanded (<italic>k</italic> = 2) relative uncertainty of 1
    × 10<sup>−3</sup> at a pressure of 10 Pa and of 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> at 1000 Pa.</p>"
