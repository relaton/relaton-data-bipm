  content: "<p>A new 1 kg mass comparator has been designed at the METAS to be used
    for research activities in comparing 1 kg mass and buoyancy artefacts between
    air and vacuum environments. The instrument is a single-pan mass comparator using
    electromagnetic force compensation. A novel feature is a wire suspension system
    for the balance beam. This suspension, together with the differential plane mirror
    interferometer used for the alignment, provides a very high resolution of 50 ng.
    The reproducibility of the comparator in vacuum is 0.8 Âµg. The vacuum mass comparator
    was first characterized and then used for the determination of the adsorption
    layers on special 1 kg gold-coated copper buoyancy artefacts with large variations
    in surface area. The adsorption layer information is used to correct the mass
    value (determined in air) for a watt balance experiment in which measurements
    on a gold test mass are performed under vacuum.</p>"
