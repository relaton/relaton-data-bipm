  content: "<p>We address the problem of determining the combined result and its associated
    uncertainty in the measurement of a common measurand by a group of competent laboratories.
    Most data analyses of interlaboratory evaluations are based on the assumption
    that the expected values of the individual laboratory results are all equal to
    the value of the common measurand. This means that the laboratory results are
    subject to random effects only with respect to the value of the measurand. This
    assumption is frequently unjustified. We use the more realistic assumption that
    the laboratory results are subject to both random and systematic effects with
    respect to the value of the measurand. In this case, the value of the measurand
    may fall anywhere within the range of results. Therefore, a combined result and
    its associated standard uncertainty that place a non-negligible fraction of the
    results outside the 2-standard-uncertainty interval are unsatisfactory representations
    of the value of the common measurand provided by the set of laboratory results.
    The more realistic assumption requires us to deal with the uncertainty arising
    from possible systematic effects in the laboratory results. Following the approach
    of the ISO Guide to deal with systematic effects, we propose a three-step method
    to determine a combined result and its associated standard uncertainty such that
    the 2-standard-uncertainty interval would include a sufficiently large fraction
    of the results. When the interlaboratory evaluation is an International Committee
    for Weights and Measures (CIPM) key comparison, we suggest that the combined result
    and its associated standard uncertainty determined by the three-step method be
    identified with the key comparison reference value and its associated standard
    uncertainty. These quantities can then be used to specify the degree of equivalence
    of the individual laboratory results. We illustrate the three-step method by applying
    it to the results of an international comparison of cryogenic radiometers recently
    organized by the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR).</p>"
