  content: "<p>Generator systems realizing a dew-point temperature scale were compared
    using a chilled-mirror hygrometer. The comparison was carried out by the laboratories
    maintaining the national standards for humidity in Denmark, Finland, Poland, the
    Russian Federation, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The Centre for
    Metrology and Accreditation (MIKES, Finland) co-ordinated the project and acted
    as the pilot laboratory. The project was carried out in several sub-loops to produce
    information about the stability of the transfer standard. To analyse the results,
    the comparison reference value (CRV) was calculated at each measurement point
    using a cluster method. The CRV was then compared with the results obtained by
    the participants and normalized errors (<italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub>) were calculated.
    Most of the results show good agreement. The measurements at the METAS, UME and
    VNIIM did not cover the whole range of the project.</p>"
