abstract:
- content: "<p>Key comparison data are often reported, as a matter of policy, with
    respect to a reference value calculated from the pool of the participants' results.
    Consideration of the comparison data sets, particularly with regard to the consequences
    and implications of such data pooling, can justify the choice of a simple statistical
    reference value. Recent key comparisons in thermometry are examined to illustrate
    the nature of the problem, and the utility of a simple approach to creating pooled
    data distributions. An objective criterion is introduced to help determine when
    a comparison can safely be described as a single population having a key comparison
    reference value (KCRV). Graphical techniques of data pooling are presented as
    an aid to harnessing expert opinion on this question.</p>"
