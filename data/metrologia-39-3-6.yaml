abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents methods for evaluating, expressing and using the
    uncertainty associated with complex S-parameter measurements. The methods are
    based on internationally recommended guidelines, published by the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO), with extensions to accommodate the complex
    nature of the measurands. The treatment of measurements from both one-port and
    multi-port devices is presented and this is used to propagate uncertainty from
    complex-valued S-parameters to radio frequency (rf) and microwave quantities derived
    from these. A simple example, involving the comparison loss correction used during
    a microwave power meter calibration, is included to demonstrate the principles
    of propagating the uncertainty in complex S-parameter measurements.</p>"
