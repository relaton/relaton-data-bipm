abstract:
- content: "<p>Key comparison CCEM.RF-K7.b.F of antenna factors, piloted by the UK
    National Physical Laboratory (NPL) between February 1996 and September 1999, is
    described. Six antennas, of types typically used for electromagnetic compatibility
    (EMC) compliance testing within the frequency band 30 MHz to 1 GHz, were circulated
    to the six participating laboratories. The antenna factors of each antenna were
    measured at six to ten frequencies. A broad agreement of antenna factors within
    Â±1 dB among the laboratories was reached.</p>"
