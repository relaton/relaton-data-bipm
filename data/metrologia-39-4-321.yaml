abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The evaluation procedure of a new laser-cooled caesium fountain primary frequency standard developed
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is described. The new standard, NIST-F1, is described in some detail and typical operational parameters are discussed. Systematic frequency biases for which corrections are made - second-order Zeeman shift, black-body radiation shift, gravitational red shift and spin-exchange shift - are discussed in detail. Numerous other frequency shifts are evaluated, but are so small in this type of standard that corrections are not made for their effects. We also discuss comparisons of this standard both with local frequency standards and with standards at other national laboratories.</p>
