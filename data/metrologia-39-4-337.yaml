    <p>The decade series of 10-5-2-2'-1 and 10-5-3-2-1 for submultiples of the unit of mass have been studied
    to find designs suitable for the use of two comparators. The criterion used in finding the designs was to minimize, using the least-squares method, the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the inversion matrices of the normal equations. To date, researchers have reported that when more than one comparator is used in a decade with an orthogonal design for one comparator, the orthogonality is lost to produce covariances. However, this study has found several cases where orthogonal designs can be used with two comparators in a decade and which could reduce variances and covariances. Even though the orthogonal designs are for cases where the ratio of the comparator's standard deviation is 2, a simulation showed that extended values of the ratio could be used to reduce variances with these designs.</p>
