  content: "<p>A statistical method is given for the combination of measurement results
    in an interlaboratory comparison to obtain a summary reference value and its uncertainty.
    The method allows objective treatment of measurements suspected of being outliers
    and objective treatment of measurements with individual uncertainties that appear
    overly optimistic. This is achieved by assuming that the measurement procedure
    of each laboratory is subject to a hidden error, and not just the procedures of
    those laboratories whose results appear to be outliers. The basic method can be
    extended to allow these errors to be drawn from different distributions for well-defined
    subsets of laboratories, and to allow the errors within these subsets to be correlated.
    Examples are given using actual data.</p>"
