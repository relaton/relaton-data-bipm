    <p>At the beginning of 1981 the research group working on the metrology of surface roughness and form
    deviations at the Czechoslovak Institute of Metrology, Bratislava, had developed the production of depth-setting standards by the planar technology that was widely used in the semiconductor industry. Production was interrupted and we are now attempting to relaunch it on a new technological basis. This paper describes the technological procedures involved in forming the vertical structure of roughness standards at what is now the Slovak Institute of Metrology (SMU).</p>
