    <p>The energy of the narrow resonance at 1.75 MeV in the <sup>13</sup>C(p,γ)<sup>14</sup>N reaction has been measured to be
    1746.618(17) keV, using the Auckland heavy-ion source system (HISS). When this result is used to derive a value for the (<sup>13</sup>C + <sup>1</sup>H - <sup>14</sup>N) atomic mass difference, it validates HISS at the 18(24) parts per million (ppm) level.</p>
