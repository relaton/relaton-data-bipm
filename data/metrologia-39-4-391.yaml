    <p>A comparison of wavelength scales derived from standard Cd, Hg and Kr lamps and the new scale
    derived from heterodyne frequency measurements is presented. The comparison is based on recent interferometric measurements by Griesmann and Kling of wavelengths of transitions at 152 nm and 180 nm in singly ionized silicon, which were in effect calibrated by heterodyne frequency measurements. These wavelengths are in excellent agreement with results for the same lines from experiments calibrated by standard hollow cathode lamps.</p>
