    <p>The results of a comparison of spectral irradiance scales between the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST, USA), and the Metrology Research Institute, Helsinki University of Technology (HUT,
    Finland), are presented. The comparison was carried out by measuring irradiances of two sets of 1 kW FEL-type lamps in the spectral range 290 nm to 900 nm. One set had calibration from the NIST 1992 source-based scale and the other from the HUT detector-based scale. The spectral irradiance values measured by the HUT are slightly higher than those given by the NIST: the differences are less than 1% in the visible/near-infrared wavelength region and up to 3.3% in the ultraviolet. The relative expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the comparison varies between 3.1% to 1.0% from 290 nm to 900 nm, respectively.</p>
