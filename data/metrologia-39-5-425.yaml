    <p>The application of technological advances has dramatically improved our ability to measure the absolute
    value of g, the free-fall acceleration due to gravity. Over the past thirty years this improvement has been nearly three orders of magnitude! Today, the value of gcan be determined with an accuracy approaching 1 ÂµGal (10<sup>-8</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>) and measured with a precision that is at least ten times better. This paper reviews the history of and the reasons for this progress as well as taking a look to the future.</p>
