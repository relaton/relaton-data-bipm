    <p>The current uses of terrestrial gravity reference stations, which have made a major contribution to world
    gravity standards, are discussed. Traditionally, reference networks have served a wide spectrum of applications, offering a limited number of absolute observations and a great number of relative observations. Some recent developments have significantly affected this classical procedure, such as the much wider availability of absolute gravimeters and more accurate evidence of the significant impact of environmental parameters on reference stations. The diversity of user requirements and of gravimetric observation techniques has also become more obvious. Based on these developments and on cost/benefit considerations of the system comprising observation instrument and station site, certain changes in the realization of world gravity standards are examined. For example, different applications require dedicated solutions that cannot be met by a conventional multi-purpose gravity reference network; for some applications, station monitoring is crucial. Also, as instrumental standardization is increasing, the role of classical combined absolute and relative observations adjustment is decreasing, which will in turn affect the organization of world gravity standards.</p>
