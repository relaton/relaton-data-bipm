  content: "<p>We describe the design of and first results from a cam-driven portable
    absolute gravimeter. The cambased design of a dropper allows us to build a compact
    system that uses 20 mm of free fall for the measurement. The instrument drops
    a test mass 200 times a minute (a measurement rate of more than 3 times per second).
    The centre of mass of the apparatus is kept fixed during the entire measurement
    cycle, thus avoiding ``recoil'' effects that could systematically bias the measurement.
    Seismic isolation is provided by a passive eddy-current-damped simple spring.
    Measurement results taken at Table Mountain Gravity Observatory (TMGO, Boulder,
    Colorado), though reproducible at a level of several microgals (1 µGal = 10<sup>-8</sup>
    m/s<sup>2</sup>), show a sensitivity to the measurement start and stop points
    at the 20 µGal level.</p>"
