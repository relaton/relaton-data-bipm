    <p>The new A-10 absolute gravimeter was tested at the Sixth International Comparison of Absolute
    Gravimeters in 2001 and compared with the more traditional types of absolute gravimeter. Some aspects of the new software system are presented as well as some of the technical features of this automated absolute gravimeter. There is still a need for improvement and a systematic effect in the observations has to be resolved before this device can be considered to be accurate in the field.</p>
