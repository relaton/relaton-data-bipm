    <p>Absolute gravity measurements using the FG5-202 gravimeter have been conducted twice a year since
    September 1999 along a 120 km long profile across the Belgian Ardenne and the Roer Graben. As in this region there is a difference of an order of magnitude between the inferred vertical crustal movements deduced from the difference of levelling (about 1 mm/year) and geological information (0.1 mm/year), our goal is to better constrain the present-day deformation. The absolute gravity measurements are performed at Rochefort, Humain, Werpin, Manhay, Sprimont, Membach (Belgium) and Monschau, Jülich and Bensberg (Germany). A complete description of the network is given, and specific difficulties at some stations are presented. The precision achieved, generally less than 2.0 µGal integrated over more than 24 h of observation, is quite satisfactory at all stations but Jülich. The mining activities around Jülich cause an increase in the noise up to 7 µGal integrated over more than 72 h. We also discuss possible causes of gravity variations in this region. At present, it is still not possible to detect any trend in the available data. However, after five years of observations, we should be able to detect or constrain any possible long-term trend with a limit of 2.5 mm/year, assuming that a height change of 1 mm causes a change in gravity of 0.2 µGal. To ensure that the absolute gravimeter is giving accurate results, it has been regularly compared with the superconducting gravimeter installed at the Membach reference station.</p>
