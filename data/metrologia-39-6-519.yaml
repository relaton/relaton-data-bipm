    <p>For applications in vacuum metrology, gas flowmeters have to deliver pure gas flows with well-known
    molar flow rates of low (&lt; 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/s) and very low values. Accurate flowmeters are used to generate pressures in continuous expansion systems, to measure leak rates, and to measure pumping speeds of ultrahigh-vacuum pumps. At the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) a new, fully automated, all-metal flowmeter was commissioned for use with a continuous expansion system in the pressure range 10<sup>-10</sup> Pa to 3 × 10<sup>-2</sup> Pa. It delivers gas flows with molar flow rates between 4 × 10<sup>-13</sup> mol/s and 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/s (throughputs 10<sup>-6</sup> Pa l/s to 3 Pa l/s at 23 °C) with
    relative standard uncertainties ranging from 1.45% at 4 × 10<sup>-13</sup> mol/s down to 0.14% at 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/s.</p>
