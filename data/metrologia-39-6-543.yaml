    <p>The 21st General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) considered in 1999 a resolution
    proposing that the neper rather than the bel should be adopted as the coherent derived SI unit. The matter remains open for consideration until the next CGPM in 2003. Further arguments are presented showing the confusion generated by the use of some dimensionless units, while the changes that the SI will have to face in the future are of a quite different nature.</p>
