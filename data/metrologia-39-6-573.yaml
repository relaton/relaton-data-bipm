abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>In order to evaluate the concordance of two primary low-gas-flow standards based on completely
    different principles with different traceability to the International System of Units (SI), the Laboratoire National
    d'Essais (BNM-LNE, France) and the Swiss Federal Office of Metrology and Accreditation (METAS, Switzerland) carried out a bilateral comparison. The two measuring principles - dynamic gravimetry at the BNM-LNE and dynamic volumetry at METAS - were compared by means of a commercial transfer standard molbox/molbloc with flows of nitrogen in the range from 3 ml/min to 10 l/min at 0 °C and 101.325 kPa (3.75 mg/min to 12.5 g/min). The measurement results show relative differences between the two primary standards of less than ±0.1 % for flows in the range 10 ml/min to 10 l/min.</p>
