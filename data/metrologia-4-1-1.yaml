abstract:
- content: "<p>A determination of the NSL unit of resistance based on standards of
    length and frequency has been made. A cylindrical cross-capacitor, for which the
    change in capacitance for a measured change in length may be calculated very precisely,
    is used to calibrate a number of small fixed capacitors (1/6 or 1/4 pF). AC bridge
    techniques are used to build up to 10 nF and also to measure the resistance of
    a 10 kΩ resistor in terms of this capacitance and a measured frequency (ω = 10<sup>4</sup>).
    DC measurements are used to relate the 10 kΩ resistor to the Laboratory's 1 Ω
    standard resistors.</p><p>The estimated uncertainty in the measurements is 2 in
    10<sup>7</sup> but the accuracy of the determination is limited to ± 7 in 10<sup>7</sup>
    because of the uncertainty in the speed of light. Mean values, derived from a
    number of determinations, and corresponding to the times of the BIPM international
    comparisons, are</p><p>\n \n\nJan. 1964\nΩ<sub>NSL</sub> = 1 Ω - 3.58 μΩ\n\n\nFeb.
