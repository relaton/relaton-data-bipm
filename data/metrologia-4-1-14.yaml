abstract:
- content: <p>The International Practical Temperature Scale has a lower temperature
    limit of 90.18 K; measurements below this temperature are commonly made in terms
    of the various "national" scales. All of these scales differ significantly from
    the thermodynamic scale and exhibit undesirable variations in the size of the
    degree as a consequence; the national scales, moreover, are comparison scales,
    which are widely considered to be less satisfactory than scales defined in terms
    of fixed points and interpolating instruments. Various proposals for replacing
    this mixture by a single scale have been or are being developed; these are all
    based, in the 12 K to 90 K range, on the results of a comparison of four national
    scales recently carried out at Moscow and Teddington.</p><p>This paper attempts
    to analyze the reproducibility of some of these proposed scales and their relation
    to the current best estimate of the thermodynamic scale. The significant lack
    of reproducibility found for these proposed scales below 50 K may either be tolerated,
    or alternatively must be reduced by further restrictions on thermometer characteristics.
    These proposed scales exhibit systematic variations in the size of the degree
    with temperature. These variations can be substantially reduced by modification
    of the mathematical treatment of the experimental data on which the scales are
    based; one such modification is presented here.</p><p>Further analysis of the
    behavour of current and proposed scales will be enormously facilitated if the
    results of additional, highly accurate comparisons over wide temperature ranges
    and involving many types of thermometers become available.</p>
