  content: "<p>The thermodynamic temperature scale was realized over the range -183
    °C to 100 °C by using a helium constant volume gas thermometer. The scale was
    compared with the International Practical Temperature Scale using platinum resistance
    thermometers. The IPTS appears to differ from the thermodynamic scale by about
    -10 millidegrees at the oxygen point and +0.5 millidegree at the steam point.
    Differences at intermediate temperatures are considerably higher (up to 36 millidegrees).
    The estimated accuracy of these results is ±2 millidegrees.</p>"
