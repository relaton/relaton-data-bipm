  content: "<p>The methods for the calibration of radioactive neutron sources are
    reviewed with particular emphasis on the manganese sulphate bath technique. For
    Be(α, n) sources the accuracy of measurement is presently limited to slightly
    less than ±1%. Further improvement would essentially require the availability
    of better cross section data for the nuclides directly or indirectly involved
    in the calibration and, in addition, a better knowledge of the neutron spectrum
    emitted by the source.</p>"
