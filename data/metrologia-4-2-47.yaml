  content: "<p>A constant volume gas thermometer (CVGT), which was constructed at
    the National Standards Laboratory, Australia, has been used to determine the resistance
    vs temperature relationships for a number of germanium thermometers to a accuracy
    of ± 3 millideg. in the temperature range from 2 to 16 K using the NBS Platinum
    Resistance Thermometer Scale (1955) for reference temperatures. One of these thermometers
    subsequently was calibrated against the NBS Acoustic Thermometer Scale [National
    Bureau of Standards Provisional Scale, 2 to 20 K (1965)]. A complete description
    is given of the CVGT and the data which were obtained with it, as well as a discussion
    of comparisons which were made between the CVGT scale and the NBS-Acoustic, liquid
    helium vapor pressure (T<sub>58</sub>), and NBS Platinum Resistance Thermometer
    (1955) scales. In general, the NSL CVGT and the NBS-Acoustic scales are in agreement
    within their combined experimental error (± 5 millideg.) if a slight shift (+
    0.015%) is made in the NBS Platinum Resistance Thermometer Scale (1955) on which
    the CVGT data are based. These data agree with the Acoustic Thermometry data in
    suggesting that the boiling point of helium (T<sub>58</sub>) is low on the Kelvin
    Thermodynamic scale by as much as 8 (± 3) millideg.</p>"
