abstract:
- content: <p>The National Research Council (Canada) and the National Physical Laboratory
    (UK) have each obtained the units of reactance and resistance from the metre and
    second by the use of similar Campbell standards of mutual inductance. A direct
    comparison of the units of inductance derived in the two laboratories has been
    made, using a third Campbell standard whose value was determined electrically.
    Comparison of the results established by NRC and NPL, which differ by about three
    parts per million, indicate that each laboratory has achieved a good "best estimate"
    of the computed value of its standard of mutual inductance. Despite the good agreement,
    the trend today in national laboratories is to substitute calculated capacitance
    for calculated inductance as the primary basis for the units of reactance and
    resistance.</p>
