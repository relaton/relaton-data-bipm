abstract:
- content: "<p>The uncertainty, expressed as 99% confidence limits, obtainable in
    the precise calibration of Pt/Pt - 10% Rh thermocouples in the range 630.5 °C
    to 1063 °C has been determined to be approximately ±1.0 μV when based on a practical
    number of five replicates at each of the three primary calibration points. The
    accuracy of a subsequent measurement of a temperature using a calibrated thermocouple,
    from which systematic errors have been reduced to insignificance is ±0.2 degC.
    Details are given of the apparatus and procedure used in calibration. The assessment
    of accuracy has been carried out by the application of rigorous statistical methods
    which are described.</p>"
