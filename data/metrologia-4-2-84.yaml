abstract:
- content: "<p>The theory of the modified normal distributions is essentially based
    on the use of a function ϕ (modulating function) which expresses the manner in
    which the precision of repeated measurements fluctuates during the observations
    (in the classical theory this precision is, by definition, constant). In the previous
    publications, ϕ was related to Hagen's theory of elementary errors; in the present
    article ϕ is, in a more general manner, treated directly as a function of the
    standard deviation, the latter being treated as an independent variable. Two theorems
    are given, the first of which shows a property of the gaussian function and the
    second evidences a characteristic of a certain class of simple modulating functions.</p>"
