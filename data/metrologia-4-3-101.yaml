  content: "<p>A comparison between the radiometric scales of eight national standardizing
    laboratories has been carried out by interchanging tungsten-filament lamps calibrated
    in terms of total irradiance. The total spread revealed by the comparison was
    about 3%, with six out of eight laboratories agreeing to within about 1%. The
    relevance of this result to a proposed radiometric method for establishing the
    unit of light measurement is discussed.</p>"
