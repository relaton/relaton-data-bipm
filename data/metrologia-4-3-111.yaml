abstract:
- content: "<p>A description is given of the scale of total irradiance maintained
    at the National Research Council. This scale, in contrast with other national
    scales, is derived from a low temperature (50 to 150 °C) blackbody, rather than
    from a high temperature (&gt; 1000 °C) blackbody or an absolute radiometer. The
    irradiance from three tungsten-filament lamps has been measured on this scale
    as part of an international programme to intercompare irradiance scales. The results
    of several tests for systematic errors in these measurements are discussed.</p>"
