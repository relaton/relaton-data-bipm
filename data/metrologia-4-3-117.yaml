  content: "<p>The temperature of an acetylene – air flame is calculated from thermochemical
    data to be 2600 ± 3 K. This accuracy suggests the use of such a flame temperature
    (in the Thermodynamic Temperature Scale) as an extension of gas thermometric temperatures.
    A real acetylene-air flame at 40 l/min of air and the optimum mixing ratio was
    measured to have a temperature (in the International Practical Temperature Scale)
    of 2554 ± 3 K. Energy losses from such a flame, due to radiation, conduction and
    incomplete equilibration of the reaction products, were measured. The calculated
    flame temperature, corrected for these losses, amounted to 2600 - 41 = 2559 ±
    4 K. The inaccuracy is still too large to indicate a correction of the IPTS (i.e.
    of the value of the gold point), but the values of the calculated flame temperature
    are more accurate and more direct than other determinations of thermodynamic temperatures
    in this range.</p>"
