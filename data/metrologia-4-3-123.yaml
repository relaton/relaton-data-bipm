abstract:
- content: "<p>The temperature of a laminar, premixed acetylene-air flame is measured
    with a photo-electric modification of the method of line-reversal. The influence
    of a number of parameters is investigated, from which the reproducibility of this
    reversal temperature is found to be Â± 2 K at about 2500 K. The use of such a flame
    as a secondary standard of temperature, which is free from ageing effects, is
    discussed.</p>"
