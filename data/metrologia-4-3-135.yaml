  content: "<p>This paper reviews various techniques of very precise distance measurement
    and in this context presents the possibilities of optical interferometry. It is
    concluded that the latter will play the primary role for highly precise measurements
    of lengths up to 100 m and well beyond that in special cases.</p>"
