abstract:
- content: "<p>Design and performance of two atomic hydrogen masers constructed at
    the National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada, are discussed. Measurements are
    given of the relative stability of the two masers for periods from 10 sec to 3
    weeks, and the maser frequencies related to that of the NRC long cesium beam frequency
    standard over a 41 day period. The latter measurements are related to other cesium
    frequency standards in the United States and Canada. The best stability for a
    single maser was found to be about 1 Ã— 10<sup>-14</sup> for averaging periods
    of 1 h over a 24 h period.</p>"
