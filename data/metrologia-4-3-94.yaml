abstract:
- content: "<p>A combined Maxwell Series resonance bridge is used to determine the
    unit of resistance in terms of the unit of inductance. A calculable single-layer
    coil is used as a standard of inductance. Only one capacitor, which has to be
    stable but not exactly known, is switched from one bridge arm to the other. The
    time constants of the resistors as well as the distributed and stray capacities
    of the coil are measured separately and taken into account when evaluating the
    bridge equation. Experimental results with frequencies of 225 and 317 Hz show
    that the error limits of the electrical measurements do not exceed 0.5 ppm.</p>"
