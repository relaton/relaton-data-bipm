abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of a determination of the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton,
    a twin jet pneumatic gauging method was used to measure the overall widths of
    two rectangular coils. Each coil consisted of three turns of a flat silver strip
    cemented to a Pyrex frame 800 mm long by 190 mm wide. Measurements were made at
    some 130 positions along each pair of strips and it is considered that the accuracy
    of measurement at any one position was to approximately one part in one million.</p><p>Combination
    of these results with those of earlier measurements of the thickness of the silver
    strips, so as to obtain the required mean distance between centres of the strips,
    is also discussed.</p>"
