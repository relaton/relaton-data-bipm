    <p>As part of a determination of the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, a twin jet pneumatic gauging method was used to measure the overall widths of two rectangular coils. Each coil consisted of three turns of a flat silver strip cemented to a Pyrex frame 800 mm long by 190 mm wide. Measurements were made at some 130 positions along each pair of strips and it is considered that the accuracy of measurement at any one position was to approximately one part in one million.</p>
    <p>Combination of these results with those of earlier measurements of the thickness of the silver strips, so as to obtain the required mean distance between centres of the strips, is also discussed.</p>
