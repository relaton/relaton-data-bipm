abstract:
- content: "<p>A brief outline is given of recent improvements to the Line-Standard
    Interference Comparator of the National Research Council of Canada.</p><p>The
    results of some measurements on Metre-Bars are presented which show that the accuracy
    attainable with present day techniques of interferometry is 0.02 μm in lengths
    up to 1 m (2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>). It is shown that severe limitations to
    this accuracy may arise from the mechanism used for pointing on the graduations.
    Tilting the axis of the pointing microscope for example by as little as 10 min
    of arc may lead to discrepancies of 0.10 μm or larger in the measurement of an
    interval.</p>"
