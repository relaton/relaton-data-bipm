abstract:
- content: "<p>Time scales have traditionally provided the time of day and the season
    of the year, as well as time interval, and if it is to be of universal use the
    atomic scale must be coordinated with astronomical scales. Two major steps in
    the coordination have already been taken: the atomic unit has been defined in
    terms of the second of Ephemeris Time, and the scales were made to agree on 1st
    January 1958. If the rotation of the Earth were constant the scales would continue
    to agree, but because of the variations in the rate of rotation the atomic scale
    will diverge from the astronomical scale unless some adjustments are made to bring
    them together. The present method of adjustment is to apply a frequency offset
    from the nominal value to the oscillator from which the 1s timing pulses are derived
    and when necessary a step adjustment to the epoch of the signals. This method
    possesses serious disadvantages and it is suggested that all standard transmissions
    should operate at their nominal values provision being made to supply those users
    needing astronomical time with the difference between atomic and astronomical
    time.</p>"
