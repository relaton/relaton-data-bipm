abstract:
- content: "<p>The accuracy of the National Research Council 2.1 m cesium beam frequency
    standard has been re-evaluated using the two NRC hydrogen masers as stable comparison
    standards. At the time of re-evaluation, the various uncertainties gave rise to
    an error limit of ±3.8 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, with a most probable value of ±1.5
    × 10<sup>-12</sup> if they were assumed to be random. After application of all
    corrections, the agreement with several other cesium standards, as determined
    from monthly VLF comparisons during January to March, 1968, appears generally
    to be within the narrower limits of ±1.5 × 10<sup>-12</sup>.</p>"
