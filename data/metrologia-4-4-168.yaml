abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the research by Amagat, a number of works have been reported
    on the pressure calibration methods with a freepiston gage, by which pressures
    were always measured under a dynamic balancing state.</p><p>The purpose of this
    research is to develop a new method of pressure calibration with no leak and no
    friction under a static balancing state, which enables us to obtain the best possible
    accuracy with easy operations. For this purpose a lever-type controlled-clearance
    piston gage has newly been designed and manufactured, taking account of such considerations
    as adoption of a piston of large diameter (11.3 mm), detection of leak and friction,
    and measurement of temperature at an effective area position.</p><p>The following
    is a summary of the experimental results of this apparatus. A state of no leak
    and no friction is easily produced with an application of the external pressure
    calculated theoretically. The apparatus can be kept in this state for hours together
    with the slightest temperature rise at the effective area part. It is recognized
    that estimated limits of uncertainty of this apparatus is less than ± 1.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup>.</p>"
