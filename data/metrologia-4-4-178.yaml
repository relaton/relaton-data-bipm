abstract:
- content: "<p>Equations are given to illustrate some possible causes of systematic
    error in the 4πβ-γ coincidence method. In particular the measurement of the absolute
    disintegration rate of radionuclides with complex decay schemes and of pure β
    emitters by the use of the efficiency tracer technique are discussed. The validity
    of the equations for the former situation is confirmed by measurements of the
    absolute disintegration rate of sources of Cs-134 using β counters with 2π and
    4π geometry.</p>"
