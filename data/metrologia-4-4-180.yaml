abstract:
- content: "<p>Improved reliability in electrical measurements comes from a combination
    of increased accuracy of the basic standards, improvements in the quality of the
    working standards, and advances in the techniques of comparison and scaling from
    lower to higher values. The national laboratories must devote much of their efforts
    toward these improvements, and the progress at NRC is an example of what has taken
    place in the last decade or two in the areas of electromotive force, resistance,
    and capacitance.</p>"
