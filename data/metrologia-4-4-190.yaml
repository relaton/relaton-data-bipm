abstract:
- content: "<p>The units of physical measurement and their standards do not remain
    unchanged. If they were not improving in precision they would quickly become inadequate.
    Some examples illustrate the breadth, diversity and interesting character of the
    scientific researches involved. The laboratories of the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures, and the mechanisms under the Bureau's direction, assure the
    coordination and the completion of researches undertaken by all the institutes
    interested in scientific metrology up to the point where government decisions
    are taken on the basic units.</p>"
