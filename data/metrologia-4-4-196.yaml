abstract:
- content: "<p>I very much regret that circumstances necessitate my giving up the
    editorship of Metrologia with the appearance of this issue.</p><p>Being the first
    editor has been a most rewarding experience in many ways and particularly in the
    very generous support that I have received from distinguished scientists in many
    countries. For this support I record my very deepest appreciation. Together we
    have launched a new journal that has quickly justified the action of the International
    Committee of Weights and Measures in sponsoring it by the number of its subscribers,
    their extraordinarily wide geographical distribution, the distinction of its authors,
    and the extent to which reference is made to its articles. Gratitude must also
    be expressed for the foresight and courage of Springer-Verlag in assuming financial
    responsibility and for the excellence of the technical production.</p><p>The requirement
    of science and industry for progress in fundamental metrology is growing fast
    and in the future the demand for even greater progress will be very insistent.
    With wise guidance Metrologia can only become a more important and valuable medium
    of publication. Thus, it makes me very happy to pass the responsibility of editor
    to my colleague, Dr H Preston-Thomas, who has worked so effectively with me since
    the very beginning. I wish him and Metrologia the very best success.</p>"
