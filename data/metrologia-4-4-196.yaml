    <p>I very much regret that circumstances necessitate my giving up the editorship of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> with the appearance of this issue.</p>
    <p>Being the first editor has been a most rewarding experience in many ways and particularly in the very generous support that I have received from distinguished scientists in many countries. For this support I record my very deepest appreciation. Together we have launched a new journal that has quickly justified the action of the International Committee of Weights and Measures in sponsoring it by the number of its subscribers, their extraordinarily wide geographical distribution, the distinction of its authors, and the extent to which reference is made to its articles. Gratitude must also be expressed for the foresight and courage of Springer-Verlag in assuming financial responsibility and for the excellence of the technical production.</p>
    <p>The requirement of science and industry for progress in fundamental metrology is growing fast and in the future the demand for even greater progress will be very insistent. With wise guidance  <italic>Metrologia</italic> can only become a more important and valuable medium of publication. Thus, it makes me very happy to pass the responsibility of editor to my colleague, Dr H Preston-Thomas, who has worked so effectively with me since the very beginning. I wish him and  <italic>Metrologia</italic> the very best success.</p>
