  content: "<p>In partnership with Institute of Physics Publishing (IOPP), \n <italic>Metrologia</italic>
    embarks on a new phase of its development with \nthe publication of volume 40.
    This first issue publishes the \nproceedings of the NEWRAD 2002 conference. In
    the past, \nNEWRAD special issues have typically taken of the order of \nfifteen
    months or so from the time of the meeting to appear in \nprint. The fact that
    in this case the time to publication is less \nthan nine months is testimony to
    one of the many advantages \nthat IOPP can bring to the publication of the journal,
    and in \nthe future even shorter times are envisaged.</p>\n<p>Readers will notice
    that the composition of the Editorial \nBoard has changed. I should like to take
    this opportunity to \nthank the outgoing members of the Board for the valuable
    \ninput they have provided over the years, generously \ncontributing their time
    and expertise for the advancement of \nthe journal. At the same time I extend
    a welcome to the new \nmembers, confident in the expectation that they will use
    their \nwide knowledge and experience to ensure that the high \nstandards of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>
    are maintained.</p>"
