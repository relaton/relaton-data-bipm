abstract:
- content: "<p>As the new Chairman of the NEWRAD Committee, I am delighted to \nintroduce
    this special issue of Metrologia that records the \nproceedings of NEWRAD 2002,
    which was held at the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, Gaithersburg,
    Maryland on 20-24 May 2002. As in \nprevious conferences, there was a range of
    contributions with a strong \nemphasis on applications, and the Conference provided
    the usual valuable \nopportunity to listen to the needs of user communities. As
    a result of \nresource constraints, National Metrology Institutes and other standards
    \nbodies are, these days, targeting their activities more and more onto \ntopics
    of the highest priority. Events such as NEWRAD therefore provide a \nunique opportunity
    to gather the latest ideas, to assess the state of the \nart and to help assign
    priorities. As in the past, it also was an occasion \nat which collaborations
    between various communities were strengthened and \nduring which much exchange
    of information and ideas could take place. The \nconvivial atmosphere created
    by Al Parr and his NIST colleagues did much to \nstimulate this interchange and
    we are grateful to them for their efficient \nlocal organization.</p><p>The change
    of Committee Chairman also provides me with an\nopportunity to offer a few remarks
    on the departure of Terry\nQuinn from the BIPM. One of the founders of NEWRAD,
    Terry has,\nof course, made major personal contributions to the field and\nhas
    championed this conference since its first meeting in 1985.\nWe owe him a great
    debt of gratitude and wish him a long and\nhappy retirement. For my part, following
    Terry as Director of the\nBIPM and as Chairman of your committee is a huge challenge.
    I\nthoroughly enjoyed my period as President of the Consultative\nCommittee for
    Photometry and Radiometry and look forward to\ncontinuing my association with
    the community at future NEWRAD\nmeetings.</p><p>We plan to return to Davos for
    the next NEWRAD in late\nSeptember/early October 2005 and are grateful to Werner
    Schmutz\nof the World Radiation Centre for his help in the arrangements.\nHe may
    be contacted by telephone on +41 (081) 417 5100 and by e-mail\nat w.schmutz@pmodwrc.ch.
    I hope to see you there!</p><p>Previous NEWRAD meetings and, before that, the
    meetings on 'New \ndevelopments and Applications in Optical Radiometry' were at:<p>1985:
    Cambridge, Massachusetts;</p><p>1988: National Physical Laboratory, Teddington;</p><p>1990:
    World Radiation Centre, Davos;</p><p>1994: Physicalisch Technische Bundesanstalt,
    Berlin; and</p><p>1997: Optical Sciences Centre, University of Arizona.</p></p>"
