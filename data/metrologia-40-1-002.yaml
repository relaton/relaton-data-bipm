  content: "<p>As the new Chairman of the NEWRAD Committee, I am delighted to \nintroduce
    this special issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> that records the \nproceedings
    of NEWRAD 2002, which was held at the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology,
    Gaithersburg, Maryland on 20-24 May 2002. As in \nprevious conferences, there
    was a range of contributions with a strong \nemphasis on applications, and the
    Conference provided the usual valuable \nopportunity to listen to the needs of
    user communities. As a result of \nresource constraints, National Metrology Institutes
    and other standards \nbodies are, these days, targeting their activities more
    and more onto \ntopics of the highest priority. Events such as NEWRAD therefore
    provide a \nunique opportunity to gather the latest ideas, to assess the state
    of the \nart and to help assign priorities.  As in the past, it also was an occasion
    \nat which collaborations between various communities were strengthened and \nduring
    which much exchange of information and ideas could take place. The \nconvivial
    atmosphere created by Al Parr and his NIST colleagues did much to \nstimulate
    this interchange and we are grateful to them for their efficient \nlocal organization.</p>\n<p>The
    change of Committee Chairman also provides me with an\nopportunity to offer a
    few remarks on the departure of Terry\nQuinn from the BIPM. One of the founders
    of NEWRAD, Terry has,\nof course, made major personal contributions to the field
    and\nhas championed this conference since its first meeting in 1985.\nWe owe him
    a great debt of gratitude and wish him a long and\nhappy retirement. For my part,
    following Terry as Director of the\nBIPM and as Chairman of your committee is
    a huge challenge. I\nthoroughly enjoyed my period as President of the Consultative\nCommittee
    for Photometry and Radiometry and look forward to\ncontinuing my association with
    the community at future NEWRAD\nmeetings.</p>\n<p>We plan to return to Davos for
    the next NEWRAD in late\nSeptember/early October 2005 and are grateful to Werner
    Schmutz\nof the World Radiation Centre for his help in the arrangements.\nHe may
    be contacted by telephone on +41 (081) 417 5100 and by e-mail\nat w.schmutz@pmodwrc.ch.
    I hope to see you there!</p>\n<p>Previous NEWRAD meetings and, before that, the
