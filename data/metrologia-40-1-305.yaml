abstract:
- content: "<p>The design of a portable calibrator for solar ultraviolet spectroradiometers
    is presented. The calibrator is based on a 1 kW DXW lamp mounted in an aluminium
    housing. The use of changeable adapter plates enables reliable setting of distance
    with different spectroradiometers. The lamp irradiance is monitored with two filter
    radiometers at wavelengths of 313 nm and 368 nm. The calibrator has been thoroughly
    tested in both the laboratory and the field. The results of the field trials indicate
    that the device works satisfactorily under a wide variety of environmental conditions.
    The calibrator can be used to establish the shortest possible traceability chain
    from the national standards laboratory to field measuring instruments.</p>"
