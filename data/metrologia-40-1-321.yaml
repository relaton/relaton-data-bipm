abstract:
- content: "<p>This report describes the first Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for
    Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Radiometric Intercomparison
    (SIMRIC-1). The purpose of the SIMRIC-1 is to ensure a common radiometric scale
    among the calibration facilities that are engaged in calibrating in situ radiometers
    used for ocean colour-related research and to document the calibration procedures
    and protocols. SIMBIOS staff visited the seven participating laboratories for
    at least two days each. The SeaWiFS Transfer Radiometer (SXR-II) measured the
    calibration radiances produced in the laboratories. The measured radiances were
    compared with the radiances expected by the laboratories. Typically, the measured
    radiances were higher than the expected radiances by 0 to 2%. This level of agreement
    is satisfactory. Several issues were identified where the calibration protocols
    need to be improved, especially the reflectance calibration of the reference plaques
    and the distance correction when using the irradiance standards at distances greater
    than 50Â cm. The responsivity of the SXR-II changed from 0.3% (channel 6) to 1.6%
    (channel 2) from December 2000 to December 2001. Monitoring the SXR-II with a
    portable light source showed a linear drift of the calibration, except for channel
    1, where a 2% drop occurred in summer.</p>"
