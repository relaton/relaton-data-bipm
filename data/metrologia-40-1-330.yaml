abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper considers the possibility of improving the accuracy of the
    predictable quantum efficiency method (self-calibration) by using custom photodiodes
    at cryogenic temperatures. The photodiode quantum deficiency is partitioned into
    nine terms associated with different phenomenological loss mechanisms. The size
    of each term is estimated for operation of the photodiode at 72 K and 16 V reverse
    bias. Requirements for high-accuracy self-calibration of the value and uncertainty
    of each of the quantum deficiency terms are discussed.</p>"
