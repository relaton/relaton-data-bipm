abstract:
- content: "<p>The realization of a number of radiometric and photometric units requires
    one to measure accurately the area of precision apertures. The BIPM employs the
    laser-beam scanning technique which is based on the generation of a uniform irradiance
    by a two-dimensional superposition of many regularly spaced laser beams.</p><p>The
    existing literature describes the formation of the uniform irradiance as a superposition
    of Gaussian laser beams and derives a condition for the largest allowable lattice
    spacing to obtain the necessary uniformity. In this paper we analyse the effect
    of the use of real laser beams which are almost, but not completely, Gaussian
    by applying Fourier analysis. Experimental results of aperture measurements with
    different spacings of the laser beams are also shown. The results of the calculations
    and the measurements show a characteristic dependence of the measured area on
    the grid spacing, even for spacings sufficiently small according to the condition
    based on Gaussian theory. This can be explained by very small deviations of the
    actual beam shape from a perfect Gaussian profile.</p>"
