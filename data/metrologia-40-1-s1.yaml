abstract:
- content: "<p>The low-background infrared (LBIR) facility at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has continued to develop its facilities and
    knowledge base to meet the needs of the infrared community. Improvements in refrigeration
    capability at the LBIR facility have made it possible to perform calibrations
    of infrared sources and detectors in a stable 17 K background environment as compared
    to a relatively unstable 25 K environment available until about two years ago.
    This, combined with improved power measurement instrumentation, allows measurements
    of 1 nW with a standard uncertainty of 1% due to repeatability and reproducibility
    effects. A brief overview will be given of the changes to the LBIR facility that
    led to these improvements. The higher sensitivity in power measurement capability
    and some of the methods being used to generate low-power beams have highlighted
    new measurement issues that had previously been relatively unimportant. These
    issues include aperture quality, background scene temperature stability, beam
    shuttering, diffraction, and the noise floor of power measurement hardware. Demonstrations
    of common problems encountered will be shown and guidelines will be given for
    developing infrared sources that not only meet the needs of the user but can also
    be well calibrated.</p>"
