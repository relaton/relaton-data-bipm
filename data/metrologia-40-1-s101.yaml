  content: "<p>Electron storage rings are nearly ideal radiation sources for radiometry
    over a broad spectral range from the infrared to the x-ray region. Many national
    metrology institutes make extensive use of synchrotron radiation for radiometry.
    The Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility SURF III, which has recently been
    upgraded, is used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
    and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) operates a European radiometry
    laboratory at the third-generation storage ring BESSY II. The storage rings are
    used as calculable broadband radiation sources (primary source standards) and
    in combination with primary detector standards as sources of continuously tunable
    monochromatic radiation for detector calibration. The use of cryogenic electrical-substitution
    radiometers as primary detector standards has made it possible to considerably
    extend high-accuracy calibrations from the ultraviolet (UV) to the x-ray regime.
    Radiometry in the extreme UV (EUV) range, and in particular reflectometry, has
    become increasingly important for the development of EUV lithography. An overview
    of synchrotron radiation based radiometry will be given.</p>"
