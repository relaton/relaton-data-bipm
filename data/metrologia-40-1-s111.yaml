  content: "<p>Subcomparison CCPR-K1.b of the CCPR key comparison of spectral irradiance
    covering 200 nm to 400 nm will be carried out in 2002/03 piloted by the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig, Germany. Deuterium arc lamps will be used
    as transfer standards of spectral irradiance, although they are known to have,
    in general, poor stability and reproducibility. PTB investigated a variety of
    deuterium lamps to test their capability (stability and reproducibility) for use
    as transfer standards. A measurement facility capable of characterizing up to
    three lamps at a time has been set up. Investigations of the spectral ageing pattern
    will help to interpolate between different reference measurements to markedly
    reduce the influence of ageing effects. The application of an external SiC photodiode
    as a monitor detector was tested. Spatial characterization of the irradiance of
    each lamp was also carried out. All this all helped us to find suitable types
    of lamp, producing reasonable irradiance homogeneously enough to be non-sensitive
    to small misalignments.</p>"
