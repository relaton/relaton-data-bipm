abstract:
- content: "<p>DXW-lamps are used to calibrate spectroradiometers measuring solar
    UV radiation. To study the ageing properties of DXW-lamps two pre-aged 1 kW lamps
    were burned for over 80 h, simulating the normal use of the lamps. The lamps were
    burned about 1.5 h at a time with a 30 min period between the consecutive burns
    to allow the lamps to cool down. Usually there were four burns in a day. The irradiance
    measured by a spectroradiometer decreased by about 0.055% h<sup>−1</sup> and the
    difference between 280 nm and 400 nm wavelengths was 1% at the end of the test.
    The measured spectra were analysed to find out the emissivities and the temperatures
    of the filaments. The emissivities were compared to the emissivity at the start
    of the test burns. The emissivity seemed to remain stable during the whole burning
    time. The spectral changes can be fully explained by the changes of the filament
    temperatures, which decreased by about 8 K during the 80 h burns. No absorption
    or emission lines were found in the spectra during the test burns.</p>"
