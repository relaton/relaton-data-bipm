  content: "<p>A new source-based radiometry beamline was recently constructed at
    the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF III). The goal of this beamline
    is to establish a national source standard with a wide spectral range from the
    far ultraviolet to the infrared by using the calculability of SURF III. The new
    beamline is a straight-through white-light beamline with few, if any, optical
    components involved in delivering the radiation to the user end-station for applications
    such as source and irradiance intercomparisons. Due to the low tunable operating
    electron energy of SURF III (from 380 MeV to less than 100 MeV), the beamline
    is uniquely suited to work in the ultraviolet to infrared spectral range. In this
    paper we discuss the design of the beamline and present first results on the vertical
    angular distribution of the radiation determined with filtered radiometers in
    the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectral ranges.</p>"
