abstract:
- content: "<p>High-temperature fixed-point blackbodies based on Re–C and TiC–C metal–carbon
    eutectic alloys are being investigated for use as radiance and irradiance sources
    for precise measurements in radiometry, photometry and radiation thermometry above
    the conventionally assigned values of temperatures on the ITS-90 scale. Graphite
    crucibles having inner diameters varying between 4 mm and 10 mm were used to prepare
    the metal–carbon and metal carbide–carbon eutectics; the cells were designed and
    manufactured at VNIIOFI, Russia using high-purity materials.</p><p>The melting
    and solidification temperatures of the cells were measured. Their reproducibility
    was investigated. The radiance reproducibility of the Re–C and TiC–C fixed points
    was found to be from 0.01% to 0.03% at 650 nm wavelength depending on the cell.
    Preliminary investigations of ZrC–C fixed-point reproducibility have been carried
    out. The radiance of all measured cells agreed at the solidification point within
    0.02%.</p>"
