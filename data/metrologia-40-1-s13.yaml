  content: "<p>The desire for high-accuracy infrared sources suitable for low-background
    seeker/tracker calibrations pushes the limits of absolute cryogenic radiometry
    and blackbody design. It remains difficult to calibrate a blackbody at irradiance
    levels below 1 nW cm<sup>−2</sup> using electrical substitution radiometry. Ideally,
    the blackbody temperature should be chosen so that most of the emitted power lies
    in the spectral range of interest. This constraint frequently necessitates the
    use of small apertures (less than 1 mm diameter) to achieve the required reduction
    in power. However, the dimensions of small apertures are difficult to determine
    accurately. Also, the effects of diffraction and systematic problems such as aperture
    heating and light leaks become amplified. To diagnose these problems and to calculate
    diffraction effects, aperture dimensions must be known accurately. We describe
    a technique of radiometrically deducing the diameter of small apertures in the
    blackbody <italic>in situ</italic> utilizing the cryogenic blackbody calibration.</p>"
