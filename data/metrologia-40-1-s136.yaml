  content: "<p>Infrared (IR) radiometric applications require the use of IR detectors
    having characteristics which are stable with time. Little has appeared in the
    scientific literature on the ageing effects of IR detectors. The purpose of this
    paper is to describe some effects that can be attributed to ageing and that were
    observed in some of the IR detectors studied, and to identify their origins. It
    was observed that some IR detectors exhibit stronger ageing effects than others
    and, furthermore, that the effects of some of the observed ageing processes can
    be reversed. Some ageing effects designated apparent ageing effects are not true
    manifestations of ageing but originate from the presence of atmospheric absorption
    bands. The measured apparent structure in the response of an IR detector arises
    due to changes in the conditions which prevail in the measurement facility, differences
    in path lengths during the characterization of the detectors, errors in the wavelength
    scale or radiation bandwidth used and, in some cases, due to nonlinearities in
    the response of some IR detection systems.</p>"
