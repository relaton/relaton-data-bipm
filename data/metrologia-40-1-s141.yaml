  content: "<p>A difficulty in diverse metrological applications is the measurement
    of relatively low intensity ultraviolet radiation signals in the presence of an
    intense visible radiation background. The development of a detector technology
    that combines the high efficiency and ease of use found in Si photodiodes with
    the solar-blind characteristics of many photoemissive devices would offer an ideal
    solution to this problem. Wide bandgap semiconductors (e.g. SiC, GaN and AlGaN)
    should combine sensitivity comparable to Si photodiodes with solar-blind response.
    We present ultraviolet quantum efficiency measurements of AlGaN Schottky and GaN
    p–i–n photodiodes demonstrating responsivity in the far ultraviolet to wavelengths
    as short as 116 nm (AlGaN Schottky devices) or 180 nm (GaN p–i–n devices) and
    several orders of magnitude reduction in efficiency for photon energies below
    the bandgap. The bandgap for GaN corresponds to 365 nm wavelength, and AlGaN devices
    exhibit cut-off wavelengths as short as 260 nm.</p>"
