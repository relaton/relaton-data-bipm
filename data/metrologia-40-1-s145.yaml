abstract:
- content: "<p>Evaluation of five types of silicon photodiode was undertaken to verify
    their suitability for absolute radiometry and also for their use as transfer standards
    in the spectral region from 1 nm to 1100 nm. Four types of photodiode were fabricated
    for this study; these were the p-on-n photodiode, n-on-p photodiodes with silicon
    dioxide front windows and n-on-p photodiodes with a metal-silicide front window.
    Fabrication of photodiodes with 100% internal quantum efficiency is demonstrated
    and their necessity for making absolute radiometric measurements with the lowest
    possible uncertainty is pointed out. The linearity characteristics of these devices,
    as measured by the ac/dc method, are far superior to those of the p-on-n diodes
    especially fabricated for this work and also to those exhibited by p-on-n diodes
    widely used at present by the radiometric community. Results on the stability
    of the quantum efficiency of the fabricated diodes after exposure to intense radiation
    of 13 nm, 120 nm, 157 nm, 193 nm and 254 nm radiation will also be presented.
    Photodiodes with a metal-silicide front window were the only devices stable when
    exposed to the intense beams of third-generation synchrotrons and UV excimer lasers.</p>"
