  content: "<p>In radiometry or pyrometry, radiometers are often used to assign the
    spectral radiance or radiance temperatures of sources using ratios of signals
    which can differ by several decades. For performing ratios between such sources
    with low uncertainties, the linearity of the detectors used in the transfer radiometers
    needs to be characterized. The linearity of InGaAs photodiodes has been studied
    using the flux-addition method using a broadband infrared source with a visible-blocking
    filter. Using this technique, 18 InGaAs photodiodes from four different vendors
    were studied without spectral filtering in a broad wavelength region from 900 nm
    to 1700 nm with the diodes underfilled by the incident flux. The linearity of
    InGaAs photodiodes was determined within the range of photocurrents from 10<sup>−8</sup> A
    to 10<sup>−4</sup> A. All the InGaAs photodiodes demonstrated linearity from 10<sup>−7</sup> A
    to 10<sup>−4</sup> A within the expanded uncertainties of 0.08% (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2). The uncertainty in the linearity measurement below 10<sup>−8</sup> A is
    increased due to the increased noise in the photocurrent arising from the feedback
    resistance of the transimpedance amplifier being greater than the shunt resistance
    of the photodiode.</p>"
