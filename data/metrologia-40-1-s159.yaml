  content: "<p>When using semiconductor photodiodes in the VUV, photoelectrons emitted
    from the photodiode surface form an additional current circuit when electrons
    reach a vacuum chamber wall surrounding the photodiode. In the case where the
    rear electrode of the photodiode is grounded, and hence the sensing terminal of
    an electrometer is connected to the front electrode, the electrometer measures
    the superimposed current, that is, the photocurrent internally generated in the
    p–n junction plus the photoemission current. Experiments done for diffusion-type
    silicon photodiodes and Schottky-type GaAsP photodiodes in the wavelength range
    from 50 nm to 200 nm show that the photoemission contribution has peaks of about
    10% and 25%, respectively, of the internal photocurrent at around 100 nm for both
    without an extraction voltage. Therefore, for precise measurements of semiconductor
    photodiode photocurrents, the sensing terminal of an electrometer should be connected
    to the rear electrode of a photodiode to avoid any contribution from the photoemission
    current.</p>"
