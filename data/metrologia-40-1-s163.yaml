  content: "<p>This paper presents results of investigations of the radiant power
    spectral responsivity within the near-infrared spectral range. Large-area windowless
    Ge photodiodes 10 mm in diameter used as single photodiodes, as well as in a trap
    configuration, were studied within a wide spectral range. The spectral responsivity
    of the reflection trap detector equipped with three photodiodes is compared with
    that of a single Ge photodiode from 600 nm to 2000 nm (all photodiodes of the
    same type). The temperature effect on the spectral responsivity is shown within
    the temperature range from 10 °C to 30 °C. The results are discussed in terms
    of spectral quantum efficiency. Effects of non-linearity are also discussed.</p>"
