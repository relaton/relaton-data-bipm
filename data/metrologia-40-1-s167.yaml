abstract:
- content: "<p>Correlations in spectral standards between values at different wavelengths
    should be considered when estimating uncertainties of spectral integrals. Simple
    correlations are introduced through fixing an absolute value to a relative distribution
    over wavelengths, or through systematic errors. Such correlations are easily treated
    when calculating effects that depend only on the relative distribution. A much
    more complex situation arises when a fitting process is used as part of the primary
    derivation. Two examples are given:Â that of spectral responsivity when the quantum
    defect of silicon photodiodes is fitted to measured data, and that of spectral
    irradiance where filter radiometers are used to calibrate a lamp directly and
    a fitted function is used for interpolation. In both cases, correlations between
    spectral points are significant and varied, and while these are diluted in the
    transfer from the primary scales, the effects may be significant in calculating
    correction factors in subsequent measurement where values at different wavelengths
    are combined.</p>"
