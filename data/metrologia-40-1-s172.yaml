  content: "<p>The realization of a detector-based spectral irradiance scale at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology is described. The new scale is
    established using filter radiometers calibrated for absolute spectral power responsivity
    traceable to the NIST High-Accuracy Cryogenic Radiometer unlike the previous NIST
    spectral irradiance scales based upon the gold freezing-point blackbody. The radiance
    temperatures of a high-temperature blackbody (HTBB) operating near 3000 K are
    found using calibrated filter radiometers. The spectral irradiances of a group
    of 1000 W FEL lamps are assigned using the spectral irradiance of the HTBB determined
    using the knowledge of the geometric factors and the detector-based radiance temperatures.
    The detector-based spectral irradiance scale leads to a reduction in the uncertainties
    from the previous, source-based, spectral irradiance scales by at least a factor
    of two in the ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions, and also leads to a
    reduction in the uncertainties in the short-wave infrared wavelength region by
    at least a factor of two to ten, depending on the wavelength. Following the establishment
    of the spectral irradiance scale in the early 1960s, the detector-based spectral
    irradiance scale represents a fundamental change in the way that the NIST spectral
    irradiance scale is realized, and beginning in the calendar year 2001, all spectral
    irradiance sources are issued using the detector-based scale.</p>"
