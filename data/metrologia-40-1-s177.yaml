abstract:
- content: "<p>Here we report on an alternative approach for making spectral irradiance
    measurements of radiation sources traceable, employing our monochromator-based
    absolute cryogenic radiometer (ACR) facility to its full extent. The method makes
    use of the continuously tunable absolute radiant flux emerging from the ACR facility
    to characterize and calibrate the spectral irradiance responsivity of a second
    adjacent double-monochromator system. This system will be part of a new facility
    at NMi-VSL, called SIR, that will be used to measure spectral irradiance distributions
    of radiation sources from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. Following this
    traceability route, a fully characterized high-temperature Planckian radiator
    is not needed. Proof-of-principle measurements in the visible part of the spectrum
    show very encouraging results. Although the new facility is under construction,
    the theoretical background and a schematic description will be presented in this
    paper.</p>"
