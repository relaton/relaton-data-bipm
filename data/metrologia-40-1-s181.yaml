abstract:
- content: "<p>A new spectral responsivity scale has been derived at Instituto de
    Física Aplicada (CSIC) in the range 400 nm to 800 nm. The scale is based on three
    single silicon photodiodes whose spectral responsivity was calibrated at several
    laser wavelengths against a trap silicon detector traceable to a cryogenic radiometer.
    Spectral responsivity values are obtained by using a physical model for the diode's
    reflectance and internal quantum efficiency. The uncertainty of the new responsivity
    scale is half the previous one. The new scale agrees with the CCPR-K2.b-PREV world
    mean.</p>"
