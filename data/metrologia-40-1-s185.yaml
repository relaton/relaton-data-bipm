abstract:
- content: "<p>The design and concept of a new integrating sphere for absolute diffuse
    reflectance measurement are presented, together with an evaluation of the reflectance
    non-uniformity. The new integrating sphere was designed with emphasis on uniform
    reflectance over the sphere wall. Spectralon<sup>TM</sup> was employed as the
    inner material for the sphere wall. The integrating sphere with geodesic design
    was developed for the most appropriate specifications to realize the high reflectance
    uniformity. The evaluation of the reflectance non-uniformity of the sphere wall
    in the visible region revealed that the geodesic integrating sphere had a quite
    uniform reflectance with non-uniformity of about 0.16% on the average.</p>"
