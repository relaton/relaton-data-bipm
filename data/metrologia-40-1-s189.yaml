abstract:
- content: "<p>Absolute irradiance (and radiance) measurements are normally carried
    out with a radiometric bench consisting of two field apertures and a photodetector.
    Irradiance measurements are taken considering rectilinear propagation and are
    normally corrected from diffraction effects. In this work we treat irradiance
    measurements considering wave propagation and calculating the double diffraction.
    Within our proposal, the effects of diffraction, typically referred to as diffraction
    corrections, are handled naturally in the propagation of the cross-spectral density.
    This wave propagation allows us to calculate an instrument constant of the optical
    system, which for this case can be treated as a constant correction in irradiance
    as a function of distance. We show experimental results that verify our proposal.</p>"
