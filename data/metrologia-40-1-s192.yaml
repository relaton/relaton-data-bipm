abstract:
- content: "<p>The National Reference Reflectometer has been developed by the National
    Physical Laboratory (NPL) to realize scales for radiance factor and total diffuse
    reflectance, the latter scale being obtained through the spatial integration of
    goniometric measurements of reflectance. Analysis of its performance in the spectral
    region from 400 nm to 1000 nm shows that for spectrally neutral white materials
    such as matte white tiles and Spectralon<sup>TM</sup> plaques the instrument is
    capable of realizing 0/45 radiance factor measurements with an uncertainty of
    0.2% (k = 2) and 0/d total diffuse reflectance measurements with an uncertainty
    of approximately 0.25% (k = 2). The uncertainties depend on the variation of reflectance
    with angle, and there will therefore be some dependence on the material being
    measured. This instrument is now used to establish UK diffuse reflectance scales
    in the visible part of the spectrum.</p>"
