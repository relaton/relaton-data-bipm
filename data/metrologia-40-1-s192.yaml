  content: "<p>The National Reference Reflectometer has been developed by the National
    Physical Laboratory (NPL) to realize scales for radiance factor and total diffuse
    reflectance, the latter scale being obtained through the spatial integration of
    goniometric measurements of reflectance. Analysis of its performance in the spectral
    region from 400 nm to 1000 nm shows that for spectrally neutral white materials
    such as matte white tiles and Spectralon<sup>TM</sup> plaques the instrument is
    capable of realizing 0/45 radiance factor measurements with an uncertainty of
    0.2% (<italic>k</italic> = 2) and 0/<italic>d</italic> total diffuse reflectance
    measurements with an uncertainty of approximately 0.25% (<italic>k</italic> =
    2). The uncertainties depend on the variation of reflectance with angle, and there
    will therefore be some dependence on the material being measured. This instrument
    is now used to establish UK diffuse reflectance scales in the visible part of
    the spectrum.</p>"
