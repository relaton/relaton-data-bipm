  content: "<p>The KRISS spectral radiance standards have been realized from 250 nm
    to 2.5 µm with reference to the radiance temperature scale. Based on the definition
    of the ITS-90, the temperature scale has been realized using a copper and silver
    point blackbody. This paper briefly describes the calibration facility, which
    consists of the variable temperature blackbody, the standard radiation pyrometer
    and the spectroradiometer. All of the radiating sources and the measurement system
    were fully controlled automatically and operated by two personal computers. The
    stabilities, noise characteristics, linearity and size of source effect of the
    spectroradiometer have been measured. Using two sheets of polarizer, the degree
    of linear polarization induced by the spectroradiometer and the Mueller matrix
    elements of the polarizer have also been simultaneously measured. For a tungsten
    strip lamp to be used as a spectral radiance transfer source, the current coefficient
    of spectral radiance, the stability in conjunction with the power supply and the
    degree of polarization have been measured to yield correction values at the reference
    condition after calibration. A mathematical model for the correction procedure
    and uncertainty analysis of the calibration is proposed. The relative standard
    uncertainty of the KRISS spectral radiance scale is determined to be 0.83% at
    250 nm, 0.49% at 300 nm and less than 0.3% from 650 nm to 2.5 µm.</p>"
