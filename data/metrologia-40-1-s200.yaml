abstract:
- content: "<p>The importance of reliable spectral transmittance measurements for
    reliable thin-film characterization is demonstrated. By using a model of the spectral
    transmittance of thin-film samples, the effect of various uncertainty components
    in transmittance measurements on the determined thin-film parameters is analysed.
    The experimental results for aluminium dioxide and tantalum pentoxide thin-film
    samples show good agreement with the model.</p>"
