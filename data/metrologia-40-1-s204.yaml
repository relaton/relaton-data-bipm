  content: "<p>This paper reports on the interference and diffraction effects produced
    by a double slit illuminated with parametric fluorescence light. We have evaluated,
    in a one-dimensional frame, the single and joint photon detection probability
    per unit of area, with respect to the position of a couple of detectors, far from
    the slits, in the so-called Fraunhofer region.</p>"
