abstract:
- content: "<p>The general methodology of the calibration of broadband ultraviolet
    (UV) radiometers is considered and categorized in this paper, based on the concepts
    of effective irradiance and effective irradiance responsivity. Practical calibration
    set-up and examples of uncertainty evaluation are presented as well.</p>"
