abstract:
- content: "<p>Spectralon<sup>TM</sup> is a well known diffuse reflectance standard.
    Although ageing effects of Spectralon under high-level VUV and air UV irradiation
    have been reported, Spectralon is assumed to be stable under the normal radiation
    conditions used for calibration in standard facilities. In this paper, ageing
    effects of Spectralon under low-level irradiation and in the dark are presented.
    It has been found that ageing is mainly affected by four parameters: wavelength
    of radiation, irradiance level, radiant exposure (dose) and storage time of the
    samples. Therefore, the use of Spectralon<sup>TM</sup> as a transfer standard
    in international comparisons and maintenance of reference values is discussed.</p>"
