  content: "<p>Comparison of independent measurement results allows an assessment
    of the accuracy of the underlying methods. In this work, four multichannel filter
    radiometers were calibrated using tunable laser-illuminated and lamp-illuminated
    integrating sphere sources (ISSs). The determination of the radiance of the laser-illuminated
    ISS is based on electrical substitution radiometry at cryogenic temperatures and
    dimensional metrology of circular apertures. The determination of the spectral
    radiance of the lamp-illuminated ISS is based on blackbody physics, referenced
    to the freezing temperature of gold. By calibrating the filter radiometers using
    both methods, we compare the `detector-based' to the `source-based' radiance scale
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>"
