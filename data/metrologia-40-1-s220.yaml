  content: "<p>Results of filter radiometer characterization with a wavelength-tunable
    Ti : sapphire laser in the wavelength band around 900 nm are presented. The effect
    of interference between the reflections from filter surfaces in the case of coherent
    laser light was studied and reduced with a special filter design with antireflection
    coatings. Measuring the responsivity as a function of wavelength over a very narrow
    band was used to reveal the remaining interference effects. Uncertainty analysis
    and test results indicate that filter radiometers can be characterized with a
    relative standard uncertainty of 9×10<sup>−4</sup> using the scanning method.
    The results agree well with more conventional monochromator-based measurements.</p>"
