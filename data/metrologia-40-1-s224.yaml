  content: "<p>During the past decade, high-accuracy soft x-ray radiometry has increasingly
    gained in importance. In particular, its routine availability is a prerequisite
    for the development of extreme UV lithography (EUVL). The PTB has been providing
    EUV calibration services for many years at a dedicated radiometry beamline at
    the electron storage ring BESSY I and from the year 2000 at the new PTB synchrotron
    radiation laboratory at BESSY II. Reflectometry, especially the measurement of
    the reflectance of Mo/Si multilayer mirrors for EUVL, is a major activity at the
    beamline. As the performance of the third-generation storage ring BESSY II is
    better than that of BESSY I, the measurement uncertainties could be significantly
    reduced. Efforts were made to accurately determine the wavelength scale for the
    monochromator and to suppress diffusely scattered light. For the spectral reflectance
    of a mirror in the EUV spectral region, a relative uncertainty of <italic>u</italic>
    = 0.14% is achieved. A new reflectometer will enable PTB to characterize EUVL
    optics up to 550 mm in diameter and 50 kg in mass. Detector calibration is based
    on a primary detector standard, a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer.
    Photodiodes with a nearly constant spectral responsitivity in the soft x-ray range
    are calibrated as transfer detector standards with a relative uncertainty of <italic>u</italic>
    = 0.26% by direct comparison to the radiometer.</p>"
