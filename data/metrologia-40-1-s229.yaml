  content: "<p>One of the most demanding applications of optics and optical coatings
    is in extreme ultraviolet lithography. Optical substrates must be polished to
    an accuracy of less than a nanometre, both the substrate and multilayer coatings
    must be atomically smooth, and the coatings must have a period that is controlled
    to a few tens of picometres. The metrology must have even greater capabilities
    to assure that the strict tolerances are met. Our extreme ultraviolet reflectometry
    facility has recently been furnished with the addition of a sample chamber that
    is capable of scanning the entire surface of a mirror up to 35 cm in diameter.
    The capabilities of this chamber will be described, as will the performance of
    the monochromator. Finally a plan will be presented to increase the stability
    of our monochromator in order to meet the needs of future generations of lithography
    tools.</p>"
