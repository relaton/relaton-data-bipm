abstract:
- content: "<p>Primary standard detectors based on an ionizing chamber and a pneumatic
    Golay detector have been developed at VNIIOFI to cover the spectral range 30 nm
    to 400 nm. The double ionizing chamber was used over the spectral range 30 nm
    to 126 nm and the Golay detector to cover the range from 105 nm to 400 nm. The
    main advantage of the Golay detector is its high level, non-selective responsivity
    of 10<sup>3</sup> V W<sup>−1</sup>. The responsivity threshold is 10<sup>−10</sup> W Hz<sup>−1/2</sup>.
    Pulsed synchrotron radiation sources were used for UV beam generation. These small
    synchrotrons have strong magnetic fields and emit a high intensity, controllable
    spectrum. A transfer standard multichannel radiometer was used for the measurement
    of UV-A, UV-B and UV-C irradiance, which permitted the determination of the bactericide,
    erythemous and generally harmful UV action spectra. The development of primary
    and transfer standard detectors allowed the establishment of basic national standards
    for UV radiometry.</p>"
