abstract:
- content: "<p>The facility for automated spectroradiometric calibrations (FASCAL)
    is the primary facility for calibration of spectral irradiance and spectral radiance
    at NIST and has been in continuous use since the early 1970s. Due to the increasing
    demands for spectroradiometric calibration, especially for supporting the monitoring
    of global environmental changes, a new facility, FASCAL 2, dedicated to calibrating
    spectral irradiance has been built. This facility will enable faster responses
    to calibration requests and, ultimately, result in lower uncertainties in the
    disseminated spectral irradiances. The FASCAL 2 facility is designed with the
    objective of achieving a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 1000 : 1 from 250 nm
    to 2500 nm in a bandwidth of 4 nm to 8 nm when measuring a 1000 W FEL lamp at
    a distance of 50 cm with a receiving aperture of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The facility
    will also be capable of calibrating deuterium lamps from 200 nm to 400 nm. The
    facility has six independent source stations, with four of the stations dedicated
    to measurements with spectral irradiance lamps and two stations reserved for the
    realization of spectral irradiance scales and checking the accuracy of automated
    wavelength. After verifying that the calibrations of spectral irradiance performed
    in FASCAL and FASCAL 2 agree within their combined uncertainties, FASCAL 2 will
    become the primary NIST facility for calibration of spectral irradiance.</p>"
