abstract:
- content: "<p>At the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) silicon diode-based
    narrow-band interference filter radiometers (FR) are used for the radiometric
    determination of thermodynamic temperatures. To extend the temperature range down
    to 400 °C, the centre wavelength of the FRs was shifted from the visible to the
    near infrared (900 nm, 1000 nm and 1595 nm). An improved calibration procedure
    is presented which achieves relative uncertainties for the spectral responsivity
    of the FRs of the order of 10<sup>−4</sup>, by taking into consideration the increased
    temperature coefficient of the spectral responsivity and the nonlinearity of the
    silicon detectors when operated in the near infrared wavelength region.</p>"
