abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of radiation temperature measurements was performed
    at VNIIOFI during October 2000 using a pyrolytic graphite blackbody operating
    over the temperature range from 1600 K to 3300 K. A pyrometer and two photometers
    from VNIIOFI, a pyrometer and four broadband glass filter detectors from PTB,
    and two narrow-band interference filter based radiometers and a broadband glass
    filter radiometer from NPL were used to perform the temperature measurements in
    either radiance or irradiance mode. Across almost the entire temperature range
    the VNIIOFI, NPL and PTB instruments showed results within the combined standard
    measurement uncertainties.</p>"
