abstract:
- content: "<p>It can be difficult to evaluate Lommel functions U<sub>n</sub>(u,v)
    and V<sub>n</sub>(u,v) when u and v are both large. Here, we present an accurate
    means to evaluate such functions using contour integration. The approach suggests
    the potential for developing analogous techniques in diffraction calculations
    for many optical systems.</p>"
