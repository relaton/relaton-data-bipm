  content: "<p>Narrow-band filter radiometers at 248 nm, 313 nm, 330 nm and 368 nm
    wavelengths were used to compare calibration facilities of spectral (irradiance)
    responsivity at HUT, NPL and BNM–INM. The results are partly in agreement within
    the stated uncertainties. Use of demanding artefacts in the intercomparison revealed
    that the wavelength scales of the participating institutes deviate more than expected.
    Such effects cannot be seen in typical intercomparisons of spectral responsivity
    or spectral transmittance, where spectrally neutral samples are used.</p>"
