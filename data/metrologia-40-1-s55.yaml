  content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National
    Physical Laboratory (NPL) realize independent scales for regular transmittance
    and near-normal regular reflectance in the mid-infrared part of the spectrum.
    Comparisons of these scales have recently been completed and the results are reported
    here. The agreement was excellent, lying within the quadrature combined uncertainties
    for the great majority of values measured and within the simple sum of uncertainties
    in all cases, demonstrating the level of equivalence of the NIST and NPL scales.</p>"
