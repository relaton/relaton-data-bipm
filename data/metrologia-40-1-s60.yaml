  content: "<p>Experience with the two types of radiometers in the experiment VIRGO
    on the ESA/NASA mission SOHO launched in December 1995 has revealed important
    information about the long-term behaviour of such radiometers in space. Exposure-dependent
    changes can be determined from comparison of radiometers with different periods
    of exposure to the sun, as was done for, for example, the ACRIM series. The physical
    mechanisms for the long-term changes are not yet well understood. However, with
    the available data a model is developed which describes the temporal behaviour
    quite well and allows some inference of the mechanisms involved. The direct comparison
    of the two types of radiometers, after they have been individually corrected for
    the exposure-dependent part, reveals changes that are independent of the exposure
    to solar radiation. From this comparison an upper limit for the uncertainty of
    the long-term changes can be deduced. The uncertainty of the composite TSI depends
    mainly on the uncertainty of the tracing of ACRIM II to I, which amounts, together
    with the uncertainty of the HF correction during the gap between the two ACRIM
    experiments, to ±62 ppm (i.e. 62×10<sup>−6</sup>). Together with the result from
    a comparison with the independent record of ERBE the long-term uncertainty for
    the whole record from 1978 to present is estimated to ±85 ppm.</p>"
