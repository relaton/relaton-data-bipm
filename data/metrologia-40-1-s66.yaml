  content: "<p>More quality assurance activities are needed to minimize uncertainties
    and improve equivalence of the UV radiation data obtained at different sites worldwide
    in order to monitor trends and to determine changes due to the depletion of the
    stratospheric ozone layer. Aspects of traceability based on a calibration chain
    from a cryogenic radiometer to the spectroradiometers within a UV monitoring network,
    as well as equivalence and conformity based on intercomparisons of standard lamps
    and instruments, are discussed. Some recent developments to be used for quality
    assurance/control in UV monitoring networks are presented, covering portable monitor
    radiators, monitor systems containing photodiodes and/or LEDs as well as the calibration
    transfer from the horizontal to the vertical optical axis.</p>"
