abstract:
- content: "<p>The quantitative study of climate change over decades requires successive
    generations of satellite, airborne and ground-based instrumentation carefully
    calibrated against a common radiance scale. In NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS)
    program, the most common sources used in the laboratory radiance calibration of
    satellite, ground-based and airborne instruments operating in the reflective solar
    wavelength region of 400–2500 nm are integrating spheres and diffuse reflectance
    panels illuminated by irradiance standard lamps. Since 1995, the EOS calibration
    program operating within NASA's EOS Project Science Office (PSO) has enlisted
    the expertise of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
    University of Arizona Optical Sciences Center's Remote Sensing Group (UA), Japan's
    National Research Laboratory of Metrology (NRLM) and NASA's Goddard Space Flight
    Center (GSFC) in an effort to validate the radiance scales assigned to sources
    used in the prelaunch calibration of EOS instruments and to critically examine
    the operation, repeatability and stability of those sources. Radiance scale validation
    is accomplished using stable transfer radiometers operating at visible to shortwave
    infrared wavelengths and calibrated and characterized by each institution using
    a variety of techniques. In the 10 comparisons performed since February 1995,
    the agreement between the radiance measurements of these transfer radiometers
    is ±1.80% at 411 nm, ±1.31% at 552.5 nm, ±1.32% at 868.0 nm, ±2.54% at 1622 nm,
    and ±2.81% at 2200 nm (σ = 1).</p>"
