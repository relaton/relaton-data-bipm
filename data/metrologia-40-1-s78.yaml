abstract:
- content: "<p>Launching on the SORCE (SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment), the
    total irradiance monitor (TIM) will measure the total solar irradiance to a relative
    standard uncertainty of 10<sup>−4</sup> and a noise level of 2×10<sup>−6</sup>
    each 400 s. Because of the outstanding brightness, uniformity, stability and collimation
    of the Sun, this ambient temperature primary radiometer achieves an absolute accuracy
    comparable to that of a cryogenic radiometer. The major paradigm shift from previous
    solar radiometers is the use of phase-sensitive detection at the shutter fundamental.
    We describe the equivalence between replacement power and radiant power as a complex
    number, the ratio of the (complex) thermal impedances. Our aperture measurements
    are provided by NIST, with added corrections for diffraction and scattering. We
    measure the cavity reflection losses versus wavelength using laser scans. We have
    verified methods for measuring, in flight, the servo gain, cavity reflection changes
    and shutter-modulated infrared offset (dark signal).</p>"
