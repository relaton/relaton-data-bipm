  content: "<p>In this paper, we describe an algorithm to correct a spectrograph's
    response for stray light. Two recursion relations are developed: one to correct
    the system response when measuring broad-band calibration sources, and a second
    to correct the response when measuring sources of unknown radiance. The algorithm
    requires a detailed understanding of the effect of stray light in the spectrograph
    on the instrument's response. Using tunable laser sources, a dual spectrograph
    instrument designed to measure the up-welling radiance in the ocean was characterized
    for stray light. A stray-light correction algorithm was developed, based on the
    results of these measurements. The instrument's response was corrected for stray
    light, and the effects on measured up-welling in-water radiance were evaluated.</p>"
