abstract:
- content: "<p>Because of its stable surface reflectance and its stable irradiance
    in the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) spectral regions, the Moon can be
    used as a reference source for monitoring the response stability of Earth-orbiting
    sensors. MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Protoflight Model
    (PFM), launched on-board the NASA Terra spacecraft on 18 December 1999, has been
    in operation for more than two years. Its reflective solar bands (RSB) are calibrated
    on-orbit by a solar diffuser (SD). In addition, MODIS on-orbit lunar views are
    used to characterize the stability of the RSB radiometric calibration and the
    response change at an angle of incidence (AOI) different from that of the SD.
    In this report, we describe an approach that properly selects the viewing conditions
    to minimize the effects that need to be corrected and its application to the MODIS
    lunar observations. Results, derived from MODIS lunar views, are reported and
    compared with the on-board SD observations.</p>"
