abstract:
- content: "<p>The MODIS Protoflight Model, launched on-board the NASA EOS Terra spacecraft
    on 18 December 1999, has been in operation for more than two years, providing
    the science community with calibrated data sets for global studies of the Earth's
    land, oceans and atmosphere. MODIS has 36 spectral bands, covering the spectral
    range from 412 nm to 14 200 nm, and provides spatial resolutions of 0.25 km (two
    bands), 0.5 km (five bands) and 1 km (29 bands) at nadir. The key on-board calibrators
    (OBCs) include a solar diffuser (SD) and a solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM)
    system for calibration of the reflective solar bands, and a V-grooved flat-panel
    blackbody (BB) for calibration of the thermal emissive bands. In this paper, we
    describe the use of OBCs for the sensor's radiometric calibration and characterization
    and discuss on-orbit performance. In addition, we provide an assessment of the
    on-orbit degradation of the SD and MODIS optics.</p>"
