  content: "<p>NIST has established a geometric aperture-area measurement facility
    for circular apertures. The instrument consists of an interferometrically controlled
    <italic>XY</italic> translation stage for high-accuracy positioning and a video
    microscope for detection of the edge of the aperture. Least-squares fitting of
    the edge points located along the aperture's inner circumference to the equation
    of a circle is used to determine the geometric area. In this paper we describe
    the measurement method, based on the work started and described by Fowler <italic>et
    al</italic> (1998 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>35</bold> 497â€“500). Analysis
    and estimation of various contributions to the overall measurement uncertainty,
    including the effects of diffraction and partial coherence of light on the edge
    location, are also discussed.</p>"
