abstract:
- content: "<p>NIST has established a geometric aperture-area measurement facility
    for circular apertures. The instrument consists of an interferometrically controlled
    XY translation stage for high-accuracy positioning and a video microscope for
    detection of the edge of the aperture. Least-squares fitting of the edge points
    located along the aperture's inner circumference to the equation of a circle is
    used to determine the geometric area. In this paper we describe the measurement
    method, based on the work started and described by Fowler et al (1998 Metrologia
    35 497â€“500). Analysis and estimation of various contributions to the overall measurement
    uncertainty, including the effects of diffraction and partial coherence of light
    on the edge location, are also discussed.</p>"
