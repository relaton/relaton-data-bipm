  content: "<p>This report describes the first Sensor Intercomparison and Merger for
    Biological and Interdisciplinary Oceanic Studies (SIMBIOS) Radiometric Intercomparison
    (SIMRIC-1). The purpose of the SIMRIC-1 is to ensure a common radiometric scale
    among the calibration facilities that are engaged in calibrating <italic>in situ</italic>
    radiometers used for ocean colour-related research and to document the calibration
    procedures and protocols. SIMBIOS staff visited the seven participating laboratories
    for at least two days each. The SeaWiFS Transfer Radiometer (SXR-II) measured
    the calibration radiances produced in the laboratories. The measured radiances
    were compared with the radiances expected by the laboratories. Typically, the
    measured radiances were higher than the expected radiances by 0 to 2%. This level
    of agreement is satisfactory. Several issues were identified where the calibration
    protocols need to be improved, especially the reflectance calibration of the reference
    plaques and the distance correction when using the irradiance standards at distances
    greater than 50Â cm. The responsivity of the SXR-II changed from 0.3% (channel
    6) to 1.6% (channel 2) from December 2000 to December 2001. Monitoring the SXR-II
    with a portable light source showed a linear drift of the calibration, except
    for channel 1, where a 2% drop occurred in summer.</p>"
