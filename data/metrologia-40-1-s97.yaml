  content: "<p>Highly polished plane gloss standards are indispensable when using
    a glossmeter. The gloss value of a primary reference standard is defined by its
    refractive index at 589.3 nm. This definition allows ease of use, but the calibration
    accuracy is limited to about ±0.5% due to inconsistency between the monochromatic
    definition and the polychromatic use in the glossmeter. Detector-based radiometry
    has improved a lot in the last 20 years and it is now time to think about changing
    the primary gloss standard calibration to absolute specular reflectance-based
    measurements. This paper is a step into this direction. It shows a refractive
    index fitting method for gloss standards based on gonioreflectometric specular-reflection
    measurements, Fresnel's equation and least-squares fitting. The refractive index
    fitted data showed ±0.23% agreement on average with the gonioreflectometric data
    measured in 1° steps and ±0.07% agreement on average for the angular corrected
    data. The requirement for an uncertainty of ±0.1% in the gonioreflectometric calibration
    was also analysed.</p>"
