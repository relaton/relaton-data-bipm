  content: "<p>A comparison of the low-frequency electric field strength in the\nrange
    from 1 V/m to 20 kV/m at frequencies of 16<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub> Hz, 50 Hz,\n60 Hz
    and 400 Hz was carried out within the scope of\nEUROMET. Eight partners from seven
    European countries were \ninvolved in the comparison; the PTB in Berlin acted
    as the pilot\nlaboratory. Tasks, organization, course, measuring equipment and\nresults
    of the comparison are described. The measuring tasks\nwere divided into two parts:
    the main task at 50 Hz line\nfrequency, obligatory for all participants, and the
    supplementary\ntasks which could be carried out on a voluntary basis. The\nreport
    on hand presents and evaluates the results achieved by\nthe participants in the
    main task. The results of the \nsupplementary tasks will be reported separately.</p>"
