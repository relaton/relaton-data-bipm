abstract:
- content: "<p>Electrical standards of low-frequency (50/60 Hz) power at 15 national
    metrology institutes (NMIs) were compared to establish the relationship between
    the electrical units at these laboratories. The results of this comparison are
    described. The differences between each laboratory's values and the reference
    values were within the measurement expanded uncertainties at a coverage factor
    \ k = 2.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final
