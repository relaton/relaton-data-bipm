  content: "<p>This report presents the results of a comparison of measurements on
    four electronic DC reference standards performed by national metrology institutes
    in the EUROMET region and BIPM. The results of the comparison, in terms of degrees
    of equivalence, show that there is a good agreement between the measurement results
    of the participants. The results also show that the time-dependent fluctuations
    in the output voltages of the travelling standards provide one of the main sources
    of uncertainty.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this
