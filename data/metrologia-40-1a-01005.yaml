abstract:
- content: "<p>In the period 1998-2001, EUROMET organized a comparison of measurements
    of 10 V DC electronic reference standards. This comparison involved 22 national
    laboratories and the BIPM. The participating laboratories maintain their voltage
    reference by Josephson effect measurements or via Zener comparisons.</p><p>This
    paper describes the way the EUROMET.EM.BIPM-K11.b reference value x<sub>R-EUR</sub>
    is computed in terms of the BIPM.EM-K11.b key comparison reference value x<sub>R</sub>,
    i.e. how the quantity (x<sub>R-EUR</sub> - x<sub>R</sub>) and its uncertainty
    are estimated.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on
    \n Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM\nkey comparison database\n kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby the CCEM according to the provisions
    of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
