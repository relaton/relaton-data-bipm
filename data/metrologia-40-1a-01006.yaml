    <p>This report presents the results of a comparison of magnetic flux by means of a coil transfer standard. Five institutes participated, with the Czech Metrology Institute acting as the pilot laboratory. The task, organization, course, measuring methods and the results of the comparison are described. With respect to the measurements of the transfer coil constant of magnetic flux, all participants' results are in accord with the weighted mean within a declared 2Ïƒ uncertainty. The good accord of the comparisons is valuable in view of the different methods and measurement techniques that were used.</p><p>Main text.
