    <p>A measurement comparison of effective efficiency has been carried out between four national metrology laboratories in waveguide R 900 at 75 GHz and 94 GHz. The original identification of the intercomparison was GT-RF/97/3 but was subsequently renumbered as
    CCEM.RF-K1d.W. One waveguide thermistor mount has been measured. The following four
    national laboratories of metrology participated: NPL (United Kingdom), BNM-LCIE
    (France), NIST (United States of America), PTB (Germany). The NPL acted as the pilot laboratory for the comparison. Good agreement between the values provided has been observed. It can be noted from tables 2 to 5
    of Appendix A that the degrees of equivalence for all the values reported, with respect to the
    reference value and between pairs of laboratories, are less than their associated uncertainty,
    at a level of confidence of 95%.</p>
