  content: "<p>This report describes the results of the international line scale comparison
    Nano3, which was carried out between 2000 and 2003 and which was accepted as supplementary
    comparison CCL-S3. This comparison was initiated by the BIPM working group on
    nanometrology as one of five international comparisons in the field of dimensional
    nanometrology. Two high quality line scales, one made of  Zerodur and one made
    of fused silica (quartz), with 280 mm main graduation length and additional smaller
    graduations of only a few mm were chosen as transfer standards. These scales were
    produced using advanced and optimized lithography and processing technologies
    by the Dr Johannes Heidenhain GmbH, Germany. A considerable number of characterizations
    of the graduations were performed in order to ensure an optimized line edge quality
    of the scales used in the comparison. Moreover, it was decided to have long gauge
    blocks manufactured out of the same piece of substrate material as was used for
    the scales. In this way, it was possible to independently determine important
    substrate material parameters like thermal expansion, compressibility and to investigate
    the long-term stability of the substrate materials.</p>\n<p>The Zerodur line scale
    standard revealed a small length reduction of about \n(−7 ± 4)×10<sup>-8</sup>/a,
    which was confirmed by the measurements on the long gauge blocks. This length
    change of the Zerodur line scale could be taken into account for the comparison
    of participant's data by the application of a linear drift model. On the quartz
    samples and linescales no comparable effects were observed.</p>\n<p>The line scales
    were measured by 13 national metrology institutes from four different metrology
    regions. Two institutes decided to withdraw from Nano3 after the measurements
    were performed, but before Draft A was circulated. The measurement uncertainties
    that were evaluated by the participants over the 280 mm length of the graduations
    showed a variation from about 300 nm down to 30 nm.</p>\n<p>The good line edge
    quality of both scales allowed a meaningful separation of the length-dependent
    and length-independent deviations from the weighted mean values. Therefore a meaningful
    comparison of these deviations with the evaluated uncertainty contributions of
    the participating institutes was possible.</p>\n<p>For the most important measurand
    of this comparison, namely the position deviations of the line structures on the
    280 mm main graduation, three results out of the 11 data sets provided had to
    be excluded by application of the  <italic>E<sub>n</sub></italic>-criterion for
    the quartz and Zerodur scales respectively. Investigations of the reasons for
    the deviations have already been started by the respective institutes, including
    bilateral follow-up line scale comparisons with the Nano3 pilot laboratory.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
