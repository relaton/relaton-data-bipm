    <p>Since 1977, six national metrology institutes (NMIs)
    have submitted ten samples of known activity of<sup>241</sup>Am to the
    International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at
    the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities
    ranged from about 3 MBq to 17 MBq. The degrees of equivalence
    between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the
    results are given in the form of a matrix for five NMIs. A graphical
    presentation is also given.</p>
