abstract:
- content: "<p>In 1993, a national metrology institute, the NPL (UK), submitted a
    sample of known activity of<sup>243</sup>Am to the International Reference System
    (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    The activity submitted was about 170 kBq. The results of this comparison are presented
    here.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final
