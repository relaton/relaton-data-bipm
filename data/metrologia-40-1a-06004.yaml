abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1976, fifteen national metrology institutes and three other laboratories
    have submitted 48 samples of known activity of<sup>57</sup>Co to the International
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 0.4 MBq to 59 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.\nTo

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n www.bipm.org/kcdb.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and\napproved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-57,\naccording to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA).</p>"
