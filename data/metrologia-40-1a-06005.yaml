  content: "<p>Since 2001, three national metrology institutes have submitted three
    samples of known activity of  <sup>18</sup>F to the International Reference System
    (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    The activities ranged from about 1 MBq to 8 MBq. \nThe degrees of equivalence
    between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix.
    A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach
