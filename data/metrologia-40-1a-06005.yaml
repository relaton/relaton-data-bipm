abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 2001, three national metrology institutes have submitted three
    samples of known activity of<sup>18</sup>F to the International Reference System
    (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    The activities ranged from about 1 MBq to 8 MBq. \nThe degrees of equivalence
    between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix.
    A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text
    of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n www.bipm.org/kcdb.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and\napproved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18,\naccording to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA).</p>"
