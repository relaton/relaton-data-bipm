abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1978, seven national metrology institutes \nhave submitted 15
    samples of known activity of<sup>58</sup>Co to the\nInternational Reference System
    (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    The activities ranged from\nabout 0.3 MBq to 9 MBq. The degrees of equivalence
    between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference\nvalue
    (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form\nof a matrix
    for six NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>The results of an
    APMP regional comparison, comparison identifier \nAPMP.RI(II)-K2.Co-58 held in
    2000 for this radionuclide have been linked to the \nSIR results through that
    of the NMIJ. This has enabled six other NMIs to have\ndegrees of equivalence in
    the KCBD.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n
    Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM\nkey comparison database\n www.bipm.org/kcdb.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby Section II of the Consultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-58,
    according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
