  content: "<p>Since 1978, seven national metrology institutes  \nhave submitted 15
    samples of known activity of  <sup>58</sup>Co to the\nInternational Reference
    System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des Poids et
    Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 0.3 MBq to 9 MBq. The degrees of equivalence
    between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference\nvalue
    (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form\nof a matrix
    for six NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p>The results of an
    APMP regional comparison, comparison identifier \nAPMP.RI(II)-K2.Co-58 held in
    2000 for this radionuclide have been linked to the \nSIR results through that
    of the NMIJ. This has enabled six other NMIs to have\ndegrees of equivalence in
    the KCBD.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this paper,
