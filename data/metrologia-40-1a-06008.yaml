abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1977, eight national metrology institutes and three other laboratories
    \nhave submitted 26 samples of known activity of<sup>51</sup>Cr to the\nInternational
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 3 MBq to 90 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form\nof a matrix for nine laboratories. A graphical presentation is also
    given.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final
    Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey
    comparison database\n kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication\nby Section II of the Consultative Committee for
    Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cr-51, according
    to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
