abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1976, ten national metrology institutes (NMI) and another laboratory\nhave
    submitted 21 samples of known activity of<sup>59</sup>Fe to the\nInternational
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 200 kBq to 20 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form\nof a matrix for ten NMI. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main
    text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n
    www.bipm.org/kcdb.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved
    for publication\nby Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)),
    comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Fe-59, according to the\nprovisions of the
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
