abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 2002, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research-National\nMetrology
    Laboratory (CSIR-NML, South Africa) and the Comisión Nacional de Energía Atómica
    (CNEA, Argentina)\nhave each submitted a further sample of known activity of<sup>60</sup>Co
    to the\nInternational Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The values of the activity submitted were
    about 210 kBq and 640 kBq respectively.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text
    of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier
