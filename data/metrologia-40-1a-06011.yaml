  content: "<p>Since 1977, fourteen national metrology institutes and three other
    laboratories \nhave submitted 33 samples of known activity of  <sup>133</sup>Ba
    to the\nInternational Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 0.3 MBq
    to 7 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured
    in the SIR and the key comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form\nof a matrix for eight laboratories. A graphical
    presentation is also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main

    \">Final Report</ext-link>.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://kcdb.bipm.org/\">kcdb.bipm.org/</ext-link>.</p>\n<p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133, according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA). The results of a CCRI international comparison, identifier
    CCRI(II)-K2.Ba-133 held in 1984 that have been approved for provisional equivalence
    for this radionuclide, have been linked to the SIR results. This has enabled six
    NMIs to update their results and a further three NMIs and one international laboratory,
    the IRMM, to be linked to the SIR.</p>"
