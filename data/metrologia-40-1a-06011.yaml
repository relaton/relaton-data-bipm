abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1977, fourteen national metrology institutes and three other
    laboratories \nhave submitted 33 samples of known activity of<sup>133</sup>Ba
    to the\nInternational Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 0.3 MBq
    to 7 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured
    in the SIR and the key comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form\nof a matrix for eight laboratories. A graphical
    presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper,
    click on \n Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby Section II of the Consultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133,
    according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). The
    results of a CCRI international comparison, identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Ba-133 held
    in 1984 that have been approved for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide,
    have been linked to the SIR results. This has enabled six NMIs to update their
    results and a further three NMIs and one international laboratory, the IRMM, to
    be linked to the SIR.</p>"
