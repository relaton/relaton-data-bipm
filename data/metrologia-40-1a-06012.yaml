  content: "<p>Since 1976, ten national metrology institutes (NMIs) and another laboratory\nhave
    submitted 20 samples of known activity of  <sup>139</sup>Ce to the\nInternational
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 0.5 MBq to 55 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form\nof a matrix for ten NMIs and the BIPM. A graphical presentation is
    also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this paper,

    \">Final Report</ext-link>.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://kcdb.bipm.org/\">kcdb.bipm.org/</ext-link>.</p>\n<p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ce-139, according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA). The results of a CCRI(II)  comparison held in 1976 that have
    been approved for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide have been linked
    to the SIR results. This has enabled another six NMIs and an international laboratory
    to have at least provisional degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database
    (KCDB), comparison identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Ce-139.</p>"
