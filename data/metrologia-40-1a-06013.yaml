  content: "<p>Since 1976, five national metrology institutes (NMIs) and another laboratory\nhave
    submitted 16 samples of known activity of  <sup>203</sup>Hg to the\nInternational
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 1 MBq to 22 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form\nof a matrix for the five NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
