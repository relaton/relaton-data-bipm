abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1978, seven national metrology institutes (NMIs) and one other
    laboratory \n\nhave submitted 12 samples of known activity of<sup>67</sup>Ga to
    the\n\nInternational Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\n\nBureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\n\nabout 4 MBq
    to 600 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each\n\nequivalent activity measured
    in the SIR and the key comparison reference\n\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form\n\nof a matrix for seven NMIs. A graphical
    presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.\n\nTo reach the main text of this
    paper, click on \n\n Final Report.\n\nNote that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM\n\nkey comparison database\n\n kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\n\nby Section
    II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n\n(CCRI(II)), comparison
    identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ga-67, according to the\n\nprovisions of the Mutual
    Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
