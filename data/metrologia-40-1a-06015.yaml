abstract:
- content: "<p>In 1988, an international comparison of<sup>125</sup>I activity measurements\nwas
    organized by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures for the \nConsultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation Section II (CCRI(II)).\nNineteen laboratories
    took part in this comparison and the details and \nresults have been published
    elsewhere. The degrees of equivalence between each\nlaboratory and the key comparison
    reference\nvalue (KCRV) have now been calculated and the results are given in
    the form\nof a matrix for 16 laboratories. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main
    text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n
    kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for
    publication\nby Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)),
    comparison identifier CCRI(II)-K2.I-125, according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual
    Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
