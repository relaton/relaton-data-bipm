  content: "<p>Since 1989, two national metrology institutes have submitted three
    samples of known activity of  <sup>166</sup>Ho<sup>m</sup> to the International
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities were between about 100 kBq and 500 kBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form of a matrix for these two NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p>The
    results of an APMP regional comparison, comparison identifier APMP.RI(II)-K2.Ho-166m,
    completed in 2000 for this radionuclide have been linked to the SIR results through
    that of the NMIJ. This has enabled five other NMIs to have degrees of equivalence
    in the KCDB.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this paper,
