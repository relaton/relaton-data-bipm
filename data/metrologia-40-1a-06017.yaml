abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1977, five national metrology institutes (NMI) and two other\nlaboratories
    have submitted eleven samples of known activity of<sup>111</sup>In to\nthe International
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the\nBureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from\nabout 1 MBq to 300 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each\nequivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference\nvalue (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form\nof a matrix for five NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main
    text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n
    kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved by
    Section II of\nthe Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison\nidentifier
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.In-111, according to the provisions of the\nMutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
