  content: "<p>The Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y \nTecnológicas
    (CIEMAT, Spain) has submitted a sample of known activity of \n <sup>67</sup>Ga
    to the International Reference System (SIR) recently for activity \ncomparison
    at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The value of \nthe activity
    submitted was about 8 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between \neach equivalent
    activity measured to date in the SIR and the key comparison \nreference value
    (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in \nthe form of a matrix
    for eight NMIs including the CIEMAT. A graphical \npresentation is also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
