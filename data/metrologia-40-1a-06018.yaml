abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centro de Investigaciones Energéticas, Medioambientales y \nTecnológicas
    (CIEMAT, Spain) has submitted a sample of known activity of<sup>67</sup>Ga to
    the International Reference System (SIR) recently for activity \ncomparison at
    the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The value of \nthe activity submitted
    was about 8 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between \neach equivalent activity
    measured to date in the SIR and the key comparison \nreference value (KCRV) have
    been calculated and the results are given in \nthe form of a matrix for eight
    NMIs including the CIEMAT. A graphical \npresentation is also given.</p><p>Main
    text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n
    kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for
    publication by \nSection II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation
    (CCRI(II)), \ncomparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ga-67, according to the provisions
    of \nthe Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
