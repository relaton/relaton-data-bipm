abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1978, seven national metrology institutes (NMI), the BIPM and
    \nanother laboratory have submitted twenty samples of known activity of<sup>109</sup>Cd
    \nto the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the \nBureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about \n2.5 MBq
    to 210 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent \nactivity measured
    in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) \nhave been calculated
    and the results are given in the form of a matrix for \nfour NMIs and the BIPM.
    A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>The results of a CCRI international
    comparison, identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Cd-109 held in 1986 that have been approved
    for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide, have been linked to the SIR
    results. This has enabled three NMIs to update their results and a further eight
    NMIs and one international laboratory, the IRMM, to be linked to the SIR.</p><p>Main

    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n
    kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for
    publication\nby Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation
    (CCRI(II)), \ncomparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cd-109, according to the\nprovisions
    of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
