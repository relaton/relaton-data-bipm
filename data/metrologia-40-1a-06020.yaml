  content: "<p>Since 1978, three national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted
    \nseven samples of known activity of  <sup>99</sup>Mo to the International Reference
    \nSystem (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids \net
    Mesures. The activities ranged from about 8.8 MBq to 1.5 GBq. The \ndegrees of
    equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR \nand the key
    comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the \nresults are given
    in the form of a matrix for three NMIs. A graphical \npresentation is also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
