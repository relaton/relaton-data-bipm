  content: "<p>Since \n2002, two national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted
    three samples \nof known activity of  <sup>85</sup>Kr to the International Reference
    System (SIR) for \nactivity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et
    Mesures. The \nactivities ranged from about 19 MBq to 460 MBq. The degrees of
    equivalence \nbetween the two participants have been calculated and the results
    are given \nin the form of a matrix. </p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach
