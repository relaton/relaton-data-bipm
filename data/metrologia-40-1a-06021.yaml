abstract:
- content: "<p>Since \n2002, two national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted
    three samples \nof known activity of<sup>85</sup>Kr to the International Reference
    System (SIR) for \nactivity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et
    Mesures. The \nactivities ranged from about 19 MBq to 460 MBq. The degrees of
    equivalence \nbetween the two participants have been calculated and the results
    are given \nin the form of a matrix.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text
    of this paper, click on \n Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved by Section II of\nthe Consultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison\nidentifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Kr-85,
