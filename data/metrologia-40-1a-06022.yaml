  content: "<p>Since 1981, three national metrology institutes (NMI) and two other
    laboratories have submitted nine samples of known activity of  <sup>123</sup>I
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 1.8 MBq to
    84 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in
    the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and
    the results are given in the form of a matrix for three NMIs and an international
    laboratory. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p>The results of a EUROMET
    comparison, identifier EUROMET.RI(II)-K2.I-123 held in 1983 that have been approved
    for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide, have been linked to the SIR
    results. This has enabled two other NMIs to have their results in the key comparison
    database.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this paper,
