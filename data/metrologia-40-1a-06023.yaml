- content: |-
    <p>Since 1977, 15 national metrology institutes (NMI) and one other laboratory have submitted 35 samples of known activity of<sup>131</sup>I to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 200 kBq to 67 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for 13 NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.I-131, according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
