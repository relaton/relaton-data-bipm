  content: "<p>Since 1976, 13 national metrology institutes (NMIs) and three other
    laboratories have submitted 29 samples of known activity of  <sup>134</sup>Cs
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 0.2 MBq to
    4.3 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured
    in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form of a matrix for nine NMIs and the BIPM.
    A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p>The results of a CCRI international
    comparison, identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Cs-134 held in 1978 that have been approved
    for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide, have been linked to the SIR
    results. This has enabled three NMIs to update their results and a further ten
    NMIs and one international laboratory, the IRMM, to be linked to the SIR.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
