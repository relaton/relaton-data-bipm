  content: "<p>Since 1976, twelve national metrology institutes (NMI), the BIPM, an
    international laboratory and one other laboratory have submitted 35 samples of
    known activity of  <sup>54</sup>Mn to the International Reference System (SIR)
    for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The
    activities ranged from about 300 kBq to 41 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between
    each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix
    for twelve laboratories. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
