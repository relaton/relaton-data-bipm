abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1976, 15 national metrology institutes (NMIs) and two other laboratories
    have submitted 34 samples of known activity of<sup>137</sup>Cs to the International
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 550 kBq to 67 MBq. The degrees
    of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key
    comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form of a matrix for eleven NMIs and the BIPM. A graphical presentation
    is also given.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click
    on   Final Report.\nNote that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of
    the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication\nby Section II of the Consultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation\n(CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-137,
    according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). The
    results of a CCRI international comparison, identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Cs-137 held
    in 1982 that have been approved for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide,
    have been linked to the SIR results. This has enabled three NMIs to update their
    results and a further three NMIs and one international laboratory, the IRMM, to
    be linked to the SIR.</p>"
