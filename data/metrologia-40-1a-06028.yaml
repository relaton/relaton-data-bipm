    <p>Since 2000, two national metrology institutes (NMIs) have submitted two samples of known activity of  <sup>177</sup>Lu to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities were about 135 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the two NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
