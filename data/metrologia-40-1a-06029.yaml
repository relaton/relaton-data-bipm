    <p>Since 1977, three national metrology institutes (NMI) and two other laboratories have submitted eight samples of known activity of<sup>95</sup>Nb to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities ranged from about 570 kBq to 3.7 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for three NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
