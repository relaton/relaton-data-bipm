    <p>Results are presented of comparisons of eleven national primary standards for air kerma with the BIPM primary standard over the range of x-radiation qualities from 10 kV to 50 kV. For each radiation quality, the results are analysed in terms of the degree of equivalence,  D<sub>i</sub>, of each national standard  i with respect to the key comparison reference value. The degrees of equivalence,  D<sub>ij</sub>, between each pairing of national standards  i and  j are also evaluated. These data form the basis of the matrices and graphs of results entered in the BIPM key comparison database for comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K2.</p><p>Main text.
