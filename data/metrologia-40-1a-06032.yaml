    <p>In 1978, the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) (USA) submitted a sample of known activity of<sup>203</sup>Pb to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The value of the activity submitted was about 220 MBq.</p><p>Main text.
