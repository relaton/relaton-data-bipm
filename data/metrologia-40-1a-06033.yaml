abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2003, the Radioisotope Centre, (RC, POLATOM, Poland) submitted a
    sample of known activity of<sup>60</sup>Co to the International Reference System
    (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    The value of the activity submitted was about 180 kBq.</p><p> Main text. \nTo

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    result of this comparison has been approved for publication by Section II of the
    Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60, according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA). It has been added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence that now contains
    21 results.</p>"
