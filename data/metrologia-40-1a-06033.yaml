    <p>In 2003, the Radioisotope Centre, (RC, POLATOM, Poland) submitted a sample of known activity of  <sup>60</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The value of the activity submitted was about 180 kBq.</p>

    <p>The result of this comparison has been approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60, according to the
    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). It has been added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence that now contains 21 results.</p>
