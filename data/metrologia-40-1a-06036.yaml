    <p>Results are presented of comparisons of ten national primary standards for air kerma with the BIPM primary standard over the range of x-radiation qualities from 100 kV to 250 kV. For each radiation quality, the results are analysed in terms of the degree of equivalence,  <italic>D<sub>i</sub></italic>, of each national standard  <italic>i</italic> with respect to the key comparison reference value. The degrees of equivalence,  <italic>D<sub>ij</sub></italic>, between each pairing of national standards  <italic>i</italic> and  <italic>j</italic> are also evaluated. These data form the basis of the matrices and graphs of results entered in the BIPM key comparison database for comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K3.</p>
