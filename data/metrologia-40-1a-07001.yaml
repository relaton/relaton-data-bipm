  content: "<p>An intercomparison of volume standards, 50 mL and 100 mL pycnometers,
    was decided on at the NORAMET Technical Contacts Meeting of 8-9 June 1998. The
    participating laboratories were CENAM, NIST, and NRC. NRC acted as the pilot laboratory.
    The comparison was done between April 1999 and October 1999. The pycnometers were
    not protected against evaporation by a supplementary cap. Even\nwith this handicap,
    the three laboratories agreed with one another very well. The difference between
    maximum and minimum reported volumes never exceeded 0.014%. This comparison was
    assigned the number SIM.M.FF-S1.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the
