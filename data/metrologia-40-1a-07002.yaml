abstract:
- content: "<p>\nThis report summarizes the results of a regional key comparison \n(APMP-IC-2-97)
    under the aegis of the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) for \npressure measurements
    in gas media and in gauge mode from 0.4 MPa to 4.0 MPa. \nThe transfer standard
    was a pressure-balance with a piston-cylinder \nassembly with nominal effective
    area 8.4 mm<sup>2</sup> (V-407) and was supplied by \nthe National Metrology Institute
    of Japan [NMIJ]. Ten standard \nlaboratories from the APMP region with one specially
    invited laboratory \nfrom the EUROMET region, namely Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    \n(PTB), Germany, participated in this comparison. The comparison started in\nOctober
    1998 and was completed in May 2001. The pilot laboratory \nprepared the calibration
    procedure [1] as per the guidelines of APMP and the\nInternational Bureau of Weights
    and Measures (BIPM) [2–4]. Detailed \ninstructions for performing this key comparison
    were provided in the \ncalibration protocol [1] and the required data were described
    in: (1) \nAnnex 3 – characteristics of the laboratory standards, (2) Annex 4 –
    the \neffective area (A′<sub>p′</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>)\n(the prime indicates values
    based on measured quantities) at 23°C of the travelling standard as a \nfunction
    of nominal pressure (p′/MPa) (five cycles both increasing and \ndecreasing pressures
    at ten pre-determined pressure points) and (3) Annex 5 \n– the average effective
    area at 23°C \n(A′<sub>p′</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>) obtained for each pressure \n
    p′/MPa with all uncertainty statements. The pilot laboratory processed \nthe information
    and the data provided by the participants for these three \nannexes, starting
    with the information about the standards as provided in \nAnnex 3. Based on this
    information, the participating laboratories are \nclassified into two categories:
    (I) laboratories that are maintaining \nprimary standards, and (II) laboratories
    that are maintaining standards \nloosely classified as secondary standards with
    a clear traceability as per \nnorm of the BIPM. It is observed that out of these
    eleven laboratories, six \nlaboratories have primary standards [Category (I)],
    the remaining five \nlaboratories are placed in Category (II).</p><p>The obtained
    data were compiled \nand processed under the same program as per the Consultative
    Committee for \nMass and Related Quantities (CCM)/BIPM guidelines. From the data
    of \nCategory (I), we evaluated the APMP reference value as a function of \n p′/MPa.
    Then, we estimated the relative difference of the \n A′<sub>p′</sub> values with
    \nreference to the APMP reference value for all participating laboratories and
    we \nobserved that they agree well within their expanded uncertainties. We \nfurther
    estimated the effective area at null pressure and at 23°C \n(A′<sub>0</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>)
    \nand the pressure distortion coefficient (λ′/MPa<sup>-1</sup>) of the transfer
    \nstandard for all the participating laboratories. We then estimated the \nrelative
    deviation of the A′<sub>0</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup> from the reference value for all
    eleven \nlaboratories and compared this with their estimated expanded uncertainties.
    \nThe result is once again extremely encouraging and all these eleven \nlaboratories
    are agreeing within their estimated maximum expanded \nuncertainties. We also
    estimated the degree of equivalence between any two \nparticipating laboratories
    following a matrix mechanism. This once again \nagrees extremely well within the
    estimated relative standard uncertainty, \nwhich is derived for the two participating
    laboratories. Finally, a new \nmethod has been introduced to evaluate these results
    and establish a link \nto CCM.P-K1c and EUROMET.M.P-K2 at two nominal pressures,
    near 1 MPa and 4 MPa. \nAgain the results show an agreement of all participating
    laboratories \nin the present comparison to within the estimated expanded uncertainties
    \nusing a coverage factor k = 2.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this
