abstract:
- content: "<p>The CCQM-K24 was performed without a pilot study prior to the key comparison
    in order to demonstrate and document the capability of interested National Metrology
    Institutes to measure the Cd amount content in a rice sample. The comparison was
    an activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM and was piloted by
    the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Geel, Belgium) of
    the European Commission.</p><p>All participants applied isotope dilution mass
    spectrometry (IDMS) using thermal ionisation MS (TIMS), sector field or quadrupole
    inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) as analytical technique. NIST reported
    a combined result of IDMS and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA)
    for the Cd amount content in the rice.</p><p>The following laboratories participated
    in this key comparison (in alphabetical order).</p><p>BAM (Germany) \nCSIR-NML
    (South Africa) \nEMPA (Switzerland) \nIRMM (European Union) \nKRISS (South Korea)
    \nLGC (United Kingdom) \nNARL (Australia) \nNIST (United States of America) \nNMi
    (The Netherlands) \nNMIJ (Japan) \nNRC (Canada) \nNRCCRM (China)</p><p>Very good
    agreement of reported results was observed. The Key Comparison Reference Value
    (KCRV) was agreed upon during the IAWG meeting in April 2002 at BIPM in Paris
    as the arithmetic mean of the reported participants' results. Accordingly the
    equivalence statements were calculated.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text

    in Appendix B of the BIPM\nkey comparison database\n www.bipm.org/kcdb.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and\napproved for publication by the CCQM
    according to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
