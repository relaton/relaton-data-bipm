abstract:
- content: "<p>The CCQM-P29 was performed in parallel to the CCQM-K24 key comparison
    in order to demonstrate and document the capability of interested national metrology
    institutes to measure the Cd and Zn amount content in a rice sample. The comparison
    was an activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM and was piloted
    by the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Geel, Belgium)
    of the European Commission. It was decided during the IAWG meeting, April 2002,
    BIPM, Paris not to include the Cd measurements results from participants in CCQM-K24
    in this CCQM-P29 pilot study.</p><p>The methods applied were isotope dilution
    mass spectrometry (IDMS) using thermal ionisation MS (TIMS), sector field or quadrupole
    inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry
    (ICP-AES) and neutron activation analysis (NAA) using instrumental neutron activation
    analysis (INAA) and k<sub>0</sub>-NAA as analytical technique.</p><p>NIST reported
    two results for Cd and Zn measurements (IDMS and INAA). VNIIM\nreported two results
    for Zn (ICP-MS and ICP-AES). The following laboratories participated in this pilot
    study (in alphabetical order).</p><p>BAM, Germany \nCENA, Brazil \nCENAM, Mexico
    \nIRMM, European Union \nKRISS, South Korea \nLGC, United Kingdom \nLNE, France
    \nNARL, Australia \nNIST, United States of America \nNMi, The Netherlands \nNMIJ,
    Japan \nNRC Canada \nNRCCRM, China \nPTB, Germany \nVNIIM, Russian Federation</p><p>The
    reported results of all participants are displayed in this report. Good agreement
    of reported results was observed. To be complete the results for Cd measurements
    of all participants in CCQM-P29 and CCQM-K24 are also graphically displayed in
    this report.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on

    BIPM\nkey comparison database\n www.bipm.org/kcdb.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and\napproved for publication by the CCQM Working Group on
    Inorganic Analysis\naccording to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA).</p>"
