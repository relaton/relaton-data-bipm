  content: "<p>A key comparison on the determination of (pp'-dichlorodiphenyl) trichloroethane
    (pp'-DDT) in a fish oil matrix has been successfully completed.  Nine NMIs participated
    in this key comparison and used the technique of isotope dilution \ngas-chromatography
    mass spectrometry (ID/GC/MS) for the determinations.  Two samples (A and B) of
    fish oil were distributed to participants, each gravimetrically spiked with pp'-DDT.
    \ The KCRV for Sample A is 0.0743 ± 0.0020 µg g<sup>-1</sup> and that of Sample
    B is 0.1655 ± 0.0014 µg g<sup>-1</sup> of pp'-DDT in fish oil.  The results for
    Sample A showed a RSD of 3.5%, the RSD for Sample B was within 1%.  These results
    were an improvement over those of the corresponding pilot study (CCQM-P21), where
    at a mass fraction of pp'-DDT in fish oil of 0.311 µg g<sup>-1</sup> the RSD was
    2.6%. The compound pp'-DDT is a typical organochlorine pesticide  and this key
    comparison has shown that NMIs have the ability to measure such compounds at levels
    typically found in the environment.  The compound (pp'-dichlorodiphenyl) dichloroethylene
    (pp'-DDE), a metabolite of pp'-DDT, was the subject of a previous key comparison
    (CCQM-K5).  The compound pp'-DDT is technically more challenging than that of
    pp'-DDE since it can decompose during the measurement procedure.  Consequently
    the success of this key comparison, combined with that of CCQM-K5 demonstrates
    a broad measurement capability by NMIs for organochlorine compounds in the environment.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
