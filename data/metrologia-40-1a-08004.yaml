abstract:
- content: "<p>A key comparison on the determination of (pp'-dichlorodiphenyl) trichloroethane
    (pp'-DDT) in a fish oil matrix has been successfully completed. Nine NMIs participated
    in this key comparison and used the technique of isotope dilution \ngas-chromatography
    mass spectrometry (ID/GC/MS) for the determinations. Two samples (A and B) of
    fish oil were distributed to participants, each gravimetrically spiked with pp'-DDT.
    The KCRV for Sample A is 0.0743 ± 0.0020 µg g<sup>-1</sup> and that of Sample
    B is 0.1655 ± 0.0014 µg g<sup>-1</sup> of pp'-DDT in fish oil. The results for
    Sample A showed a RSD of 3.5%, the RSD for Sample B was within 1%. These results
    were an improvement over those of the corresponding pilot study (CCQM-P21), where
    at a mass fraction of pp'-DDT in fish oil of 0.311 µg g<sup>-1</sup> the RSD was
    2.6%. The compound pp'-DDT is a typical organochlorine pesticide and this key
    comparison has shown that NMIs have the ability to measure such compounds at levels
    typically found in the environment. The compound (pp'-dichlorodiphenyl) dichloroethylene
    (pp'-DDE), a metabolite of pp'-DDT, was the subject of a previous key comparison
    (CCQM-K5). The compound pp'-DDT is technically more challenging than that of pp'-DDE
    since it can decompose during the measurement procedure. Consequently the success
    of this key comparison, combined with that of CCQM-K5 demonstrates a broad measurement
    capability by NMIs for organochlorine compounds in the environment.</p><p>Main
