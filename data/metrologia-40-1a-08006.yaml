abstract:
- content: "<p>The second key comparison for the quantity pH, \nCCQM-K17, was carried
    out to assess the degree of equivalence of the national primary measurement procedures
    used to determine the pH of primary standard buffer solutions.</p><p>The CCQM-K17
    comparison allows estimations of the capability of ten national metrology institutes
    (NMIs) to determine the pH of a phthalate buffer of unknown concentration at different
    temperatures. The key comparison was co-ordinated by the CCQM Working Group on
    Electrochemical Analysis and piloted by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB) with assistance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) and the Slovak Institute of Metrology (SMU).</p><p>The measurement results
    of the NMIs agreed not at the same level as for the first key comparison on pH
    CCQM-K9. The results obtained by seven of the eleven participants agree very well
    within the uncertainty stated by the participants. Four participants obtained
    results somewhat lower. The two groups of results are most obviously evident at
    a measurement temperature of 37 °C.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according
    to the\nprovisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
