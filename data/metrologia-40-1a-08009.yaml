  content: "<p>This \ncomparison, APMP.QM-K3, is intended to be an equivalent RMO
    key comparison \nin the APMP (Asia Pacific Metrology Program) region and uses
    basically the same \nprotocol as CCQM-K3. Four national metrology institutes,
    CSIR-NML (South \nAfrica), CMS-ITRI (Taiwan), KRISS (Republic of Korea) and NMIJ/CERI
    \n(Japan), participated in the key comparison. ERL-HIAST (Syria) \nparticipated
    as a 'study' and the results will not be included in MRA \nAppendix B. APMP.QM-K3
    was organized by the Korea Research Institute of \nStandards and Science (KRISS).
    The selected primary gas mixtures for this \ncomparison were individually prepared
    using gravimetry and thoroughly \nstudied for their chemical composition and stability.
    The comparison was \ncarried out at an amount-of-substance fraction level of 28
    mmol/mol \ncarbon monoxide, 124 mmol/mol carbon dioxide and 1.95 mmol/mol propane
    \nin nitrogen (balance gas). All laboratories participated as key \ncomparison
    submitted results that were within ±1% relative to the \ngravimetric value. The
    results of this comparison are linked to the key \ncomparison CCQM-K3 through
    the link laboratories: NMIJ/CERI and KRISS.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
