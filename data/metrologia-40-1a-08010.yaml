  content: "<p>The accuracy of elemental \nanalyses in complex matrices is usually
    assessed \nby analysis of a suitable matrix reference material. The reference
    value is \nascribed by consensus mean and by application of primary methods of
    \nanalysis. However, the quality of this value will be affected by problems \nsuch
    as matrix-induced interferences, moisture corrections and \nheterogeneity.</p>\n<p>Pilot
    study CCQM-P13 was undertaken to assess the capabilities of\nNational Metrology
    Institutes to analyse Ca, Cu and Cd in an acidic \nsolution that simulates the
    digest of a food sample. This study filled the \ngap between the analysis of a
    gravimetrically prepared calibration \nsolution and the analysis of an unknown
    in a complex matrix requiring \nextensive sample preparation. Having an independent
    reference value, with \na small uncertainty, allowed a more rigorous estimation
    of the reliability \nof the institutes' analysis and uncertainty estimates, without
    including \nissues around sample digestion.</p>\n<p>The reference values were:
    1.6617 ± 0.0020 µmol/g for Ca, \n7.037 ± 0.012 nmol/g for Cu and 45.57 ± 0.10
    pmol/g for Cd \n(expanded uncertainties are quoted with coverage factor of 2).
    The other \nelements in the matrix were: Na (~25 µg/g), K (~90 \nµg/g), Cl (~120
    µg/g), Fe (~100 ng/g), Mg (~5 \nµg/g), P (~5 µg/g), Sn (~80 ng/g) and Zn (~200
    \nng/g).</p>\n<p>Twelve international laboratories, representing eight countries,
    \ndetermined the amount content of the analytes. A range of techniques that \ninclude
    ID-ICP-MS (high resolution and collision cell), ICP-MS, ICP-OES, \nAAS, voltametry
    and potentiometry were used. The results for this pilot \nstudy averaged: 1.654
    ± 0.058 µmol/g for Ca (<italic>n</italic> = 10), 7.26 ± 0.53 \nnmol/g for Cu (<italic>n</italic>
    = 12) and 45.2 ± 5.1 pmol/g for Cd (<italic>n</italic> = 11) where the \nvalues
    associated with the averages are the standard deviations of  <italic>n</italic>
    \nparticipants.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold> To reach the main text of this
