abstract:
- content: "<p>The first key comparison in the area of vibration organized under\nthe
    auspices of the Consultative Committee for Acoustics,\nUltrasound and Vibration
    (CCAUV) and piloted by the\nPhysikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) was carried
    out\nbetween January 2000 and June 2001. Twelve national metrology\ninstitutes
    (NMIs) from the five regional metrology organizations\nAPMP, COOMET, EUROMET,
    SADCMET and SIM participated. On the\nbasis of thorough investigations of amplitude
    linearity, \nlong-time stability and other performance characteristics, the\npilot
    laboratory had selected two different reference\naccelerometers (back-to-back
    and single-ended) as transfer\nstandards.</p><p>\nAll NMIs applied laser interferometry
    in compliance with the\nInternational Standard ISO 16063-11:1999 for their charge\nsensitivity
    measurements for the two transfer standards from 40\nHz to 5 kHz at 22 frequencies
    (third-octave frequency series)\nwith specified uncertainties.</p><p>\nOn the
    basis of the analysis of five different methods for\ncomputing the key comparison
    reference value (KCRV) and the\ndegrees of equivalence relative to the KCRV, the
    'weighted mean\nmethod' was selected and used.</p><p>\nThe results of the CCAUV.V-K1
    are a set of KCRVs, their\nuncertainties, and degrees of equivalence of each laboratory\nwith
    respect to the KCRV and between the laboratories. The\ndegrees of equivalence
    computed for the two accelerometers and \n22 frequencies indicate that the deviations
    D<sub>i</sub> relative to the\nKCRV and the deviations D<sub>ij</sub> between
    the laboratories are smaller\nthan the relative expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of
    these\ndifferences in 96% of all cases for the back-to-back\naccelerometer and
    in 92% of all cases for the single-ended\naccelerometer. At the reference frequency
    of 160 Hz, all\nparticipating laboratories calibrated both transfer standards
    \nwith a relative expanded uncertainty smaller than 5×10<sup>−3</sup>, which is
    the limit specified by ISO 16063-11.</p>"
