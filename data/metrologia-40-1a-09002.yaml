  content: "<p>This is the final report \nfor key comparison CCAUV.A-K1 on the \npressure
    calibration of laboratory standard microphones in the frequency \nrange from 125
    Hz to 8 kHz. Twelve national measurement laboratories took \npart in the key comparison
    and the National Physical Laboratory piloted the \nproject. Two travelling standard
    microphones were circulated to the \nparticipants and results in the form of regular
    calibration certificates \nwere collected throughout the project. The key comparison
    reference value \n(KCRV) has been calculated using the unweighted mean value of
    the results. \nDeviations from this value are below 0.05 dB at all frequencies.
    A \nfrequency of 250 Hz has been chosen to illustrate the degrees of \nequivalence
    with the KCRV. In all but one case, the degree of equivalence \nis smaller than
    the associated uncertainty.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main
