abstract:
- content: "<p>An implementation of the sine-approximation method of ISO 16063-11
    (primary vibration calibration by laser interferometry) is described. The quadrature
    interference signals are generated using an interferometer as described in method
    3 of ISO 16063-11. The signal processing required for the successful implementation
    of this method of ISO 16063-11 has been implemented by various metrology institutes
    using various techniques. For the implementation of these techniques, different
    hardware and software configurations are used, ranging from expensive VAX computer
    systems to digital storage oscilloscopes.</p><p>A novel, cost effective, PC based
    system has been developed and is described herein. The hardware consists of a
    Pentium 200 with 256 MB of RAM. A commercial, four-channel analogue to digital
    (A to D) conversion card is used for performing the data capturing, while the
    signal processing software was developed to run under Microsoft Windows<sup>®</sup>.</p><p>The
    system was evaluated using data signals with and without disturbances added. The
    data signals were generated using software techniques. Further system validation
    was achieved using experimental data.</p>"
