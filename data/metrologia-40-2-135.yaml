abstract:
- content: "<p>The influence on gauge block length calibration \nattributed to changes
    in atmospheric pressure, as a result of \naltitude for example, has been described
    [1] in\nequation (1). The estimation established therein considered Young's \nmodulus
    of elasticity E, which represents normal stress and \nnormal strain per unit length;
    however, the length correction for \npressure on an object in a bath of the atmosphere
    is more \naccurately described using the bulk modulus of elasticity K, \nwhich
    represents a volume effect. The relationship between \nYoung's modulus and the
    bulk modulus is [2]</p><p></p><p>where K and E are in units of Pa, and σ is Poisson's
    \nratio. The change in length ΔL of a gauge block of \nnominal length L by a pressure
    change of ΔP in Pa, is \ngiven by [3, 4]</p><p></p><p>For practical purposes K
    = 204 GPa and σ = 0.33 for steel \ngauge blocks.</p><p>Acknowledgments \nThe author
