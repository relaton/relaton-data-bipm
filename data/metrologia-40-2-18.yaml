  content: "<p>The conditions under which results from different key comparisons in
    gas analysis can be combined are defined. The paper outlines the underlying model
    for computing degrees of equivalence. The key point in the development of the
    relevant expressions is the use of the error propagation law as given in the <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> 1993 1st edn (Geneva:Â ISO),
    to convert the error model into an uncertainty model, including covariances. The
    covariance term in the generic expression derived is the key to developing tailored
    expressions for different cases. Some typical instances are explored, including
    the linking with a bilateral key comparison and the linking with an RMO key comparison.
    Additionally, a basis is established for linking two comparisons with different
    pilot laboratories.</p>"
