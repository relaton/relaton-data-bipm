abstract:
- content: "<p>The quality of the results of a comparison measurement is often assessed
    by comparing the differences between the individual results and the reference
    value with the uncertainties of these differences. Here, this method is extended
    to cover situations in which finite effective degrees of freedom have been stated
    by at least some of the participants. Further, the special case of only two participants
    is discussed and some peculiarities are described. Finally, a method is proposed
    to assess the compatibility of the reference value model chosen with the entire
    group of measurement results.</p>"
