  content: "<p>Aluminium samples were doped with an assortment of impurities and the
    shifts of their equilibrium melting curves were determined under static adiabatic
    experimental conditions. The shift of run-off temperatures (i.e. when the sample
    temperature breaks off from the melting `plateau' and rapidly begins to rise)
    of originally 99.9999% pure Al samples caused by impurities was determined to
    be as follows (in millikelvin per part per million (ppm) by weight): Ag, −0.12;
    Zn, −0.16; Cu, −0.29; Fe, −0.35; In, −0.21; Quartz, −0.33; Si, −0.66; Ti, +3.30;
    Mn, −0.063; Cd, −0.10; Sb, −0.19; Ca ?; Ni, −0.43.</p>"
