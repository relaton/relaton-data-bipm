abstract:
- content: "<p>The role of statistical error modelling as a tool in the evaluation
    of measurement uncertainty is discussed. The discussion is limited to the use
    of error modelling as a vehicle to evaluate measurement uncertainty in agreement
    with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The discussion
    is based on practical experience gained in developing models for evaluating measurement
    uncertainty both in calibration and in testing. Until now, it has not been widely
    recognized that the development of uncertainty models may benefit from the use
    of classical error analysis techniques. The problems in modelling measurements
    are such that, based on current practice, this activity is a profession with its
    own merits and peculiarities. An application of error modelling is given by showing
    how the performance of laboratories can be assessed in linked interlaboratory
    comparisons.</p>"
