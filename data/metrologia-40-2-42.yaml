  content: "<p>The role of statistical error modelling as a tool in the evaluation
    of measurement uncertainty is discussed. The discussion is limited to the use
    of error modelling as a vehicle to evaluate measurement uncertainty in agreement
    with the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>.
    The discussion is based on practical experience gained in developing models for
    evaluating measurement uncertainty both in calibration and in testing. Until now,
    it has not been widely recognized that the development of uncertainty models may
    benefit from the use of classical error analysis techniques. The problems in modelling
    measurements are such that, based on current practice, this activity is a profession
    with its own merits and peculiarities. An application of error modelling is given
    by showing how the performance of laboratories can be assessed in linked interlaboratory
    comparisons.</p>"
