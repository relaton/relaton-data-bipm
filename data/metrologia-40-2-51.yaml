abstract:
- content: "<p>Analytical formulae for a precise sensitivity calculation of cryogenic
    current comparators (CCCs) have been derived. Their validity is checked by comparing
    with experimental measurements on practical devices. They are also used to understand
    discrepancies in previous numerical calculations. Finally, guidelines are given
    that, together with the analytical tools, will allow the design and construction
    of optimum CCCs.</p>"
