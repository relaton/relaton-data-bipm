abstract:
- content: "<p>For up-to-date absolute gravimeters, the trajectory of the test mass
    during a free-fall experiment (drop) is about 20 cm along the vertical, and the
    corresponding gravity change is about 60×10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>. The
    reference height of the derived free-fall acceleration g has to be defined with
    an accuracy of 1 mm to 2 mm within the dropping distance to preserve the accuracy
    of the measurement system (e.g. FG5: 1×10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup> to 2×10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>).
    The equation of motion comprises a vertical gravity gradient to take the height
    dependence of g into account. In general, a linear vertical gravity gradient γ
    is introduced that has been measured by relative gravimeters. In that case, the
    g-value refers to the origin of the coordinate system (z = 0), which is normally
    the starting position of the drop.</p><p>In the case of an unknown or uncertain
    gradient we recommend an alternative approach. A simple parabolic equation (assumption
    γ = 0) can be used to evaluate the time/distance data pairs, and later these g-determinations
    have to be corrected for the vertical gravity gradient using the effective measurement
    height. The solution presented is not restricted to low initial velocities. It
    considers time/distance measurements equally spaced in distance. Also, in extreme
    cases, unknown non-linearities within the vertical gravity gradient do not significantly
    affect the result of the absolute gravity determination.</p>"
