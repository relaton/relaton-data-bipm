    <p>For up-to-date absolute gravimeters, the trajectory of the test mass during a free-fall experiment (drop) is about 20 cm along the vertical, and the corresponding gravity change is about 60×10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>. The reference height of the derived free-fall acceleration <italic>g</italic> has to be defined with an accuracy of 1 mm to 2 mm within the dropping distance to preserve the accuracy of the measurement system (e.g. FG5: 1×10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup> to 2×10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>). The equation of motion comprises a vertical gravity gradient to take the height dependence of <italic>g</italic> into account. In general, a linear vertical gravity gradient γ is introduced that has been measured by relative gravimeters. In that case, the <italic>g</italic>-value refers to the origin of the coordinate system (<italic>z</italic> = 0), which is normally the starting position of the drop.</p>
    <p>In the case of an unknown or uncertain gradient we recommend an alternative approach. A simple parabolic equation (assumption γ = 0) can be used to evaluate the time/distance data pairs, and later these <italic>g</italic>-determinations have to be corrected for the vertical gravity gradient using the effective measurement height. The solution presented is not restricted to low initial velocities. It considers time/distance measurements equally spaced in distance. Also, in extreme cases, unknown non-linearities within the vertical gravity gradient do not significantly affect the result of the absolute gravity determination.</p>
