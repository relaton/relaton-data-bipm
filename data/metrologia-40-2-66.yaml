abstract:
- content: "<p>We have estimated the relativistic redshift correction due to gravity,
    necessary to reference to the geoid the measurements of the new frequency standards
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado,
    USA, using a new local survey and various methods and models. We referenced the
    frequency offsets computed from different methods to the same geoid surface, one
    defined with respect to the current best estimate of an ideal mean-Earth ellipsoid.
    The new fractional frequency results are (1) −1797.61×10<sup>−16</sup>, based
    on the global gravitational model EGM96; (2a) −1798.72×10<sup>−16</sup>, based
    on the regional, high-resolution geoid model G96SSS; (2b) −1798.49×10<sup>−16</sup>,
    based on the regional, high-resolution geoid model G99SSS; and (3) −1798.91×10<sup>−16</sup>,
    based on the value for the geopotential number provided in the National Geodetic
    Survey's data sheet for the NIST reference marker. The minus sign implies that
    clocks run faster in the laboratory in Boulder than a standard clock located on
    the geoid. The values from (2b) and (3) are expected to be the most accurate and
    are also independent. Based on these results, we estimate the frequency shift
    at the reference point at NIST to be −1798.7×10<sup>−16</sup>, with an estimated
    standard uncertainty of ±0.3×10<sup>−16</sup>.</p>"
