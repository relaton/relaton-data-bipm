  content: "<p>The paper describes a novel method for the characterization of a pneumatic
    differential transfer standard in the differential pressure range 0 Pa to 3.5 MPa
    up to a high line gas pressure of 7.0 MPa. In view of the advances in the field
    of automated data acquisition systems an effort has been made to incorporate such
    a system in the conventional pressure measurement, which uses relatively high
    accuracy piston gauges and the user-friendly digital transducer. The transfer
    standard used in the present work is a silicon strain gauge transducer, model
    PMP 4115, made by Druck, with an output voltage range of 0 V to 5 V with a readout
    unit/power supply DPI 282. The transducer was characterized against the secondary
    standard, which is a twin pressure balance, Model 5502, made by Desgranges et
    Huot, France, designated as NPL-8. The characterization was done through an automated
    data acquisition system using a model 9118HR A/D interface card made by Adlink,
    as well as the readout unit DPI 282. The uncertainty estimations showed up considerable
    differences between the two modes of data acquisition. The observed results were
    further used to generate a regression equation for the estimation of differential
    pressure at any given line pressure.</p>"
