abstract:
- content: "<p>The frequency of a helium–neon laser stabilized to the hyperfine component f
    (alternatively denoted a<sub>16</sub>) of the<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> 11-5 R(127)
    line at 633 nm has been measured with respect to the SI second using a femtosecond
    optical frequency comb generator based on a mode-locked Ti : sapphire laser and
    microstructure fibre. The standard uncertainty of this measurement is 0.6 kHz.
    The same laser was taken to BIPM mid-way through the measurements and its frequency
    compared to that of the BIPM's continuously maintained iodine-stabilized helium–neon
    laser BIPM-4. From this comparison, the frequency of BIPM-4 when stabilized to
    the same iodine hyperfine component f is 473 612 353 608.1 (0.7) kHz.</p>"
