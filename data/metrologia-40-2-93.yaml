  content: "<p>Analytic expressions are derived for the sensitivity coefficients for
    the uncertainties in both the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> calibration
    points for an arbitrary non-linear calibration equation, <italic>y</italic> =
    <italic>y</italic>(<italic>x</italic>). Formalisms for the propagation of uncertainty
    are given for both exact fitting and least-squares determinations of the adjustable
    parameters. These formulae are applied to the approximation of ITS-90 above the
    silver point by radiation thermometry, using the recently developed metal–carbon
    and metal-carbide–carbon eutectic fixed points. A modified form of the non-linear
    Sakuma–Hattori calibration equation is analysed. It is shown that for temperatures
    between the fixed points, the combined uncertainty can be kept below the uncertainty
    in the individual calibration points, and reduces as the number of degrees of
    freedom for least-squares fitting increases.</p>"
