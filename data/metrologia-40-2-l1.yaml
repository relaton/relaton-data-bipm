  content: "<p>It has recently been suggested (Steele A G, Wood B M and Douglas R
    J 2001 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>38</bold> 483â€“8) that it is desirable
    to use an approach termed `exclusive statistics' to remove any correlation between
    the results of a laboratory and the estimated Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV).
    In this communication, simple and general formulae are derived for the results
    of exclusive statistics. These show that whilst there is some benefit to be gained
    from exclusive statistics in the calculation of degrees of equivalence between
    individual laboratories and the KCRV, it is not suitable for the calculation of
    degrees of equivalence between pairs of laboratories.</p>"
