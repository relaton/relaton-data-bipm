abstract:
- content: "<p>It has recently been suggested (Steele A G, Wood B M and Douglas R
    J 2001 Metrologia 38 483â€“8) that it is desirable to use an approach termed `exclusive
    statistics' to remove any correlation between the results of a laboratory and
    the estimated Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV). In this communication, simple
    and general formulae are derived for the results of exclusive statistics. These
    show that whilst there is some benefit to be gained from exclusive statistics
    in the calculation of degrees of equivalence between individual laboratories and
    the KCRV, it is not suitable for the calculation of degrees of equivalence between
    pairs of laboratories.</p>"
