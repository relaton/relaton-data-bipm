abstract:
- content: "<p>Time-scale formation, along with atomic time/frequency standards \nand
    time comparison techniques, is one of the three basic ingredients of \nTime Metrology.\nBefore
    summarizing this Symposium and the relevant outcomes, let \nme make a couple of
    very general remarks.</p><p>Clocks and comparison methods have today reached a
    very high level of \naccuracy: the nanosecond level. Some applications in the
    real word are \nnow challenging the capacity of the National Metrological Laboratories.
    It \nis therefore essential that the algorithms dealing with clocks and \ncomparison
    techniques should be such as to make the most of\nexisting technologies. The comfortable
    margin of accuracy we were\nused to, between Laboratories and the Field, is gone
    forever.</p><p>While clock makers and time-comparison experts meet regularly \n(FCS,
    PTTI, EFTF, CPEM, URSI, UIT, etc), the somewhat\nsecluded community of experts
    in time-scale formation lacks a similar \npoint of contact, with the exception
    of the CCTF meeting. This venue \nmust consequently be welcomed.</p><p>Let me
    recall some highlights from this Symposium: there were \nabout 60 attendees from
    15 nations, plus international institutions, \nsuch as the host BIPM, and a supranational
    one, ESA.</p><p>About 30 papers, prepared in some 20 laboratories, were received:
    \namong these papers, four tutorials were offered; descriptions of local time
    \nscales including the local algorithms were presented; four papers \nconsidered
    the algorithms applied to the results of time-comparison \nmethods; and six papers
    covered the special requirements of some \nspecialized time-scale 'users'.</p><p>The
    four basic ingredients of time-scale formation: models,\nnoise, filtering and
    steering, received attention and were also\ndiscussed, not just during the sessions.</p><p>The
    most demanding applications for time scales now come\nfrom Global Navigation Satellite
    systems; in six papers the progress of \nsome programmes was described and the
    present and future needs were \npresented and documented.\nThe lively discussion
    on future navigation systems led to the \nfollowing four points:<list list-type=\"unordered\"><list-item><p>an
    overall accuracy in timing of one nanosecond is a must;</p></list-item><list-item><p>the
    combined 'clock and orbit' effects on the knowledge of \nsatellite position should
    be less than one metre;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a combined solution for positioning
    and timing should be pursued;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a 'new' time window
    (2 h to 4 h) emerged, in which the accuracy \nand stability parameters of the
    clocks forming a time scale for \nspace application are to be optimized. That
    interval is linked to \nsome criteria and methods for on-board clock corrections.</p></list-item></list></p><p>A
    revival of interest in the time-proven Kalman filter was noted; in \nthe course
    of a tutorial on past experience, a number of new approaches \nwere discussed.
    Some further research is in order, but one\nshould heed the comment: \n'do not
    ask too much of a filter'. The Kalman approach is indeed powerful \nin combining
    sets of different data, provided that the possible problems of \nconvergence are
    suitably addressed.</p><p>Attention was also focused on the possibility of becoming
    victims of \never-present 'hidden' correlations.</p><p>The TAI algorithm, ALGOS,
    is about 30 years old and the \nfundamental approach remains unchanged and unchallenged.
    A number of \nsmall refinements, all justified, were introduced in the \n'constants'
    and parameters, but the general philosophy holds.</p><p>In so far as the BIPM
    Time Section and the CCTF Working Group \non Algorithms are concerned, on the
    basis of the outcome of this \nSymposium it is clear that they should follow the
    evolution of TAI and \nsuggest any appropriate action to the CCTF.</p><p>This
    Symposium, which gathered the world experts on T/F\nalgorithms in Paris for two
    days, offered a wonderful\nopportunity for cross-fertilization between researchers\noperating
    in different and interdependent communities that are\nloosely connected.</p><p>Thanks
    are due to Felicitas Arias, Demetrios Matsakis and Patrizia \nTavella and their
    host organizations for having provided the community \nwith this learning experience.</p><p>One
    last comment: please do not wait another 14 years for the \nnext Time Scale Algorithm
    Symposium.</p>"
