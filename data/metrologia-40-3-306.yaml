abstract:
- content: "<p>For the Galileo system it is required that a space clock time prediction
    be performed, covering the time interval (T<sub>p</sub>) between two uploads.
    The time prediction accuracy of the space clock is therefore an important issue.
    The predictability of the Space Passive Hydrogen Maser (S-PHM) time error is evaluated
    by the RMS of the predicted time errors at the prediction time T<sub>p</sub>:
    ΔT<sub>RMS</sub>(T<sub>p</sub>). A linear prediction model is used, corresponding
    to the absence of a frequency drift. The results show that: (1) the RMS time error
    can be evaluated from a priori knowledge of the clock's Allan deviation; (2) conversely,
    it is possible to extract the Allan deviation from the measurement of ΔT<sub>RMS</sub>
    versus T<sub>p</sub>; (3) the modelling of ΔT<sub>RMS</sub>(T<sub>p</sub>) of
    S-PHM based on the white frequency and flicker frequency noises appears to be
    particularly accurate: the difference between the model fit and the measured prediction
    accuracy is ⩽10 ps RMS for T<sub>m</sub> = 24 h; (4) for T<sub>p</sub> = 4 h,
    the performance of the S-PHM is a factor of 4.5 better than the performance of
    the space rubidium frequency standard (S-RAFS). This has a dramatic effect on
    the probability of the Signal In Space Accuracy: assuming a Gaussian distribution
    the probability of a predicted time error ΔT⩽1.5 ns for T<sub>p</sub> = 4 h is
    89% for the S-RAFS, while the same time error constitutes an absolute upper bound
    for the Galileo S-PHM.</p>"
