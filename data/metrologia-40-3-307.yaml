abstract:
- content: "<p>The development within the International GPS Service (IGS) of a suite
    of clock products, for both satellites and tracking receivers, offers some experiences
    which mirror the operations of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)
    in its formation of TAI/UTC but some aspects differ markedly. The IGS relies exclusively
    on the carrier phase-based geodetic technique whereas BIPM time/frequency transfers
    use only common-view and two-way satellite (TWSTFT) methods. The carrier-phase
    approach has the potential of very high precision but suitable instrumental calibration
    procedures are only in the initial phases of deployment; the current BIPM techniques
    are more mature and widely used among timing labs, but are either less precise
    (common-view) or much more expensive (TWSTFT). In serving its geodetic users,
    the essential requirement for IGS clock products is that they be fully self-consistent
    in relative terms and also fully consistent with all other IGS products, especially
    the satellite orbits, in order to permit an isolated user to apply them with accuracy
    of a few centimetres. While there is no other strong requirement for the IGS timescale
    except to be reasonably close to broadcast GPS time, it is nonetheless very desirable
    for the IGS clock products to possess additional properties, such as being highly
    stable and being accurately relatable to UTC. These qualities enhance the value
    of IGS clock products for applications other than pure geodesy, especially for
    timing operations. The jointly sponsored `IGS/BIPM Pilot Project to Study Accurate
    Time and Frequency Comparisons using GPS Phase and Code Measurements' is developing
    operational strategies to exploit geodetic GPS methods for improved global time/frequency
    comparisons to the mutual benefit of both organizations. While helping the IGS
    to refine its clock products and link them to UTC, this collaboration will also
    provide new time transfer results for the BIPM that may eventually improve the
    formation of TAI and allow meaningful comparisons of new cold atom clocks. Thus
    far, geodetic receivers have been installed at many timing labs, a new internally
    realized IGS timescale has been produced using a weighted ensemble algorithm,
    and instrumental calibration procedures developed. Formulating a robust frequency
    ensemble from a globally distributed network of clocks presents unique challenges
    compared with intra-laboratory timescales. We have used these products to make
    a detailed study of the observed time transfer performance for about 30 IGS stations
    equipped with H-maser frequency standards. The results reveal a large dispersion
    in quality which can often be related to differences in local station factors.
    The main elements of the Project's original plan are now largely completed or
    in progress. In major ways, the experiences of this joint effort can serve as
    a useful model for future distributed timing systems, for example, Galileo and
    other GNSS operations.</p>"
