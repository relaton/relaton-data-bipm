abstract:
- content: "<p>The existence of power-law noise structures in the measurements of
    atomic clocks has been well documented in the literature. Each of these power-law
    noises exhibits a spectral density proportional to 1/f<sup>Î±</sup> at low frequencies.
    There is, however, another class of noise, termed fractionally integrated or long-memory
    noise, which too possesses spectral densities of this form. These fractionally
    integrated noises are analysed and applied to atomic timescales in this research.
    An alternative atomic clock model is developed and validated via simulation and
    live data tests. Estimators of clock rate and drift which account for the long-memory
    noise structures are derived and shown to produce both superior estimates of rate
    and drift and superior reports of the variability of these estimates. Estimation
    strategies which account for the autocovariance structures characteristic of fractionally
    integrated noise are also found to yield more powerful tests of hypotheses than
    do the short-memory techniques historically employed.</p>"
