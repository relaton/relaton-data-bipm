abstract:
- content: "<p>We study the case of an atomic clock whose parameters are time dependent.
    This results in a time variation of the frequency spectrum of the clock error
    that we are able to track using time–frequency techniques. The clock is modelled
    by a standard stochastic differential equation, and several cases of time-varying
    coefficients are studied, including, amongst others, sudden and periodic variations.
    The time–frequency technique used to estimate the instantaneous power spectrum
    is the sliding Welch's estimator. We present numerical simulations that prove
    the effectiveness of the approach.</p>"
