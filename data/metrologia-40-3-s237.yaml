abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years, a certain correlation detected between clocks at time
    and frequency laboratories has been the main reason behind the development of
    a revised version of the classical `Three-Cornered Hat' method as a mathematical
    tool to estimate the frequency instability of a set of clocks. The method has
    been formulated keeping in mind the possibility of dependence among clocks and
    has been generalized to an ensemble of N clocks [1–5]. It basically consists of
    the minimization of an objective function, the quadratic sum of cross-correlation
    coefficients, with the constraint condition established by the positive definiteness
    of the (estimated) absolute covariance matrix related to the clocks.</p><p>Later
    on, a matrix formulation to calculate the optimal weights in the case of correlated
    clocks was presented in [6]. The impact of this weighting procedure on the instability
    of the ensemble time was evaluated, on the basis of simulated clocks, when correlation
    was appropriately taken into account and in the case when it was neglected. That
    paper established, as a main conclusion, the mathematical treatment to be used
    in the usual case of weak dependence.</p><p>In this paper, we present a summary
    of the theory involved, and then apply the procedures to optimal weighting of
    clocks using real data clocks at Real Observatorio de la Armada (San Fernando,
    Spain). Finally, we discuss the results obtained.</p>"
