  content: "<p>The Polish independent atomic timescale TA(PL) was officially started
    on 4 July 2001. It is currently based on the indications of nine clocks from several
    Polish laboratories and Lithuania. The clocks at the laboratories are compared
    using TTS-2 multi-channel GPS receivers developed in cooperation with the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The participating institutions are
    linked to the Central Office of Measures (GUM) in Warsaw. TA(PL) is computed as
    a weighted average of the participating clocks. This paper presents the clock
    ensemble, the data processing outline, and some experimental results.</p>"
