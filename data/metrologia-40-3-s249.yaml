  content: "<p>The National Time Service Center (NTSC), Chinese Academy of Sciences,
    is responsible for the maintenance and development of the Chinese national timescale,
    UTC(NTSC). The main responsibilities include maintenance of UTC(NTSC), UTC(JATC)
    and the BPL long-wave and the BPM short-wave time transmission station. In this
    paper, we will mainly introduce recent advances in time and frequency measurement
    at NTSC, including the establishment of a local timescale, international time
    comparison and various time dissemination services in operation.</p>"
