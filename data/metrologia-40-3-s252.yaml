abstract:
- content: "<p>International atomic time (TAI) is an ensemble timescale based on a
    weighted average of clocks. The basic properties of the algorithm have been fixed
    since its inception: that is, the weight of a clock is inversely proportional
    to a variance measuring the instability of the clock, and it cannot exceed a maximum
    value. On the other hand, the procedure used to set the maximum weight has been
    subject to several changes over the years. While the most stable timescale would
    ideally be computed without an upper limit of weights, such an upper limit is
    introduced to bring reliability. Up to now, however, there has been no adopted
    measure of the reliability. In this paper, a quantitative estimator of the reliability
    is proposed, which therefore helps in choosing a weighting scheme. Different procedures
    for setting the maximum weight are examined in light of the application of the
    reliability criterion defined here. Tests using simulated and real data are presented.
    A weighting scheme to be used for TAI computation is proposed in which the reliability
    estimator is optimized.</p>"
