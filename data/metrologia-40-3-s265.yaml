  content: "<p>For the Galileo system it is required that a space clock time prediction
    be performed, covering the time interval (<italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub>) between
    two uploads. The time prediction accuracy of the space clock is therefore an important
    issue. The predictability of the Space Passive Hydrogen Maser (S-PHM) time error
    is evaluated by the RMS of the predicted time errors at the prediction time <italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub>:
    Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>RMS</sub>(<italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub>). A linear prediction
    model is used, corresponding to the absence of a frequency drift. The results
    show that: (1) the RMS time error can be evaluated from <italic>a priori</italic>
    knowledge of the clock's Allan deviation; (2) conversely, it is possible to extract
    the Allan deviation from the measurement of Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>RMS</sub>
    versus <italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub>; (3) the modelling of Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>RMS</sub>(<italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub>)
    of S-PHM based on the white frequency and flicker frequency noises appears to
    be particularly accurate: the difference between the model fit and the measured
    prediction accuracy is ⩽10 ps RMS for <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 24 h; (4)
    for <italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub> = 4 h, the performance of the S-PHM is a factor
    of 4.5 better than the performance of the space rubidium frequency standard (S-RAFS).
    This has a dramatic effect on the probability of the Signal In Space Accuracy:
    assuming a Gaussian distribution the probability of a predicted time error Δ<italic>T</italic>⩽1.5 ns
    for <italic>T</italic><sub>p</sub> = 4 h is 89% for the S-RAFS, while the same
    time error constitutes an absolute upper bound for the Galileo S-PHM.</p>"
