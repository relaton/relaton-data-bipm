abstract:
- content: "<p>In this primer we first give an overview of stochastic models that
    can be used to interpret clock noise. Because of their statistical tractability,
    we concentrate on fractionally differenced (FD) processes, which we relate to
    fractional Brownian motion, discrete fractional Brownian motion, fractional Gaussian
    noise and discrete pure power law processes. We discuss several useful extensions
    to FD processes, namely, composite FD processes, autoregressive fractionally integrated
    moving average processes and time-varying FD processes. We then consider the statistical
    analysis of clock noise in terms of how these models are manifested via the spectral
    density function (SDF) and the wavelet variance (WV), the latter being a generalization
    of the well-known Allan variance. Both the SDF and the WV decompose the process
    variance with respect to an independent variable (Fourier frequency for the SDF,
    and scale for the WV); similarly, judiciously chosen estimators of the SDF and
    WV decompose the sample variance of clock noise. We give an overview of the statistical
    properties of estimators of the SDF and the WV and show how these estimators can
    be used to deduce the parameters of stochastic models for clock noise.</p>"
