  content: "<p>The existence of power-law noise structures in the measurements of
    atomic clocks has been well documented in the literature. Each of these power-law
    noises exhibits a spectral density proportional to 1/<italic>f</italic><sup>Î±</sup>
    at low frequencies. There is, however, another class of noise, termed fractionally
    integrated or long-memory noise, which too possesses spectral densities of this
    form. These fractionally integrated noises are analysed and applied to atomic
    timescales in this research. An alternative atomic clock model is developed and
    validated via simulation and live data tests. Estimators of clock rate and drift
    which account for the long-memory noise structures are derived and shown to produce
    both superior estimates of rate and drift and superior reports of the variability
    of these estimates. Estimation strategies which account for the autocovariance
    structures characteristic of fractionally integrated noise are also found to yield
    more powerful tests of hypotheses than do the short-memory techniques historically
    employed.</p>"
