abstract:
- content: "<p>A family of second-difference statistics has been designed for use
    on regular but unevenly spaced two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT)
    time series. The characteristics of these new statistics are compared with those
    of the Allan variance (AVAR) and modified Allan variance (MVAR). The new statistics
    are used to estimate values of AVAR, MVAR and TVAR. Direct comparisons are made
    with estimates of these quantities based on an interpolated time series. Confidence
    interval determination is discussed. The application of the new variances to TWSTFT
    and geodetic GPS time transfer data is presented.</p>"
