  content: "<p>This is a study of three timescales formed from a Kalman filter operating
    on a model of a clock ensemble. The raw Kalman scale is unstable at short averaging
    times. The Kalman-plus-weights and reduced Kalman scales are stable at all averaging
    times. An optimality property is proved for the reduced Kalman scale.</p>"
