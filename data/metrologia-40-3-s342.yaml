abstract:
- content: "<p>Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) has been used
    operationally by the international time and frequency community for several years.
    This paper describes analysis techniques being developed at the National Physical
    Laboratory for the processing of TWSTFT measurements.</p><p>The measurements are
    modelled in terms of phase and normalized frequency offsets together with random
    errors considered to be a linear combination of the well-known noise types of
    white phase modulation, white frequency modulation and random walk frequency modulation
    encountered in time and frequency measurements. A method is described for solving
    the model to provide estimates of the phase and normalized frequency offsets,
    together with their associated uncertainties, at any measurement epoch. The random
    errors associated with the measurements are first characterized through the use
    of second-difference statistics. An analysis of the second-difference statistics
    is undertaken to estimate a covariance matrix for the time series of measurements.
    Finally, with the covariance matrix so obtained, generalized least-squares regression
    is used to provide unbiased and efficient estimates of the required offset parameters.</p>"
