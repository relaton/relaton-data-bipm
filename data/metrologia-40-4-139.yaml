abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes improvements to a Hilger gauge block interferometer,
    including a fibre optic feed for a traceable laser radiation, use of a CCD camera
    for computer-controlled acquisition of fringe images and automatic analysis of
    the fringe image to obtain the fringe fraction. The gauge measuring process is
    now automated, computer-controlled, more accurate and significantly faster and
    easier to operate than the original design.</p>"
