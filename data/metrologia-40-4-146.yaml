  content: "<p>The objective of this paper is to provide general principles that should
    guide any future discussions regarding the redefinition of the SI base units.
    The suggestion is to use the envisaged redefinition of the unit of mass, the kilogram,
    as an opportunity to generally check the compliance of all base units with modern
    demands and the needs of economy, science and society. In order to meet these
    requirements it is proposed principally to separate the 'carrier' of the definition
    and the 'carriers' of the realization of the SI units. By providing an example
    of a revised SI it is shown that these considerations could add value to the International
    System of Units.</p>"
