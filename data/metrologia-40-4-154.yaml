    <p>We compared the IMGC and NIST standards for small gas flows at the IMGC. The IMGC standard is a recently developed primary flow meter that extracts a large piston out of a temperature-controlled chamber. Controlling the piston's speed holds the pressure in the chamber constant. The NIST standard is a recently developed transfer standard that was calibrated against two primary standards at NIST. The first NIST primary extracts a large piston out of an oil-filled chamber in which a metal bellows is suspended. Controlling the piston's speed holds the pressure in the bellows constant. The second NIST primary is a static gravimetry method.</p>
    <p>The results include 49 nitrogen flow rates from  0.22 µmol s<sup>−1</sup> to 770 µmol s<sup>−1</sup> (1 µmol s<sup>−1</sup> = 1.3448 cm<sup>3</sup> min<sup>−1</sup> of an ideal gas at the 'standard' conditions of 0 °C and 101 325 Pa). For all but one of the comparisons, the agreement between IMGC and NIST is better than 0.06%.</p>
