- content: |-
    <p>The von Klitzing constant R<sub>K</sub> has been previously determined at the Bureau National de Métrologie (BNM) in 1986 and 1993. Considering the recommendation of the Comité Consultatif d'Electricité working group on the quantum Hall effect in 1988, as well as the differences between the values of the fine structure constant obtained from different methods, it appears to be particularly important that we continue to develop and improve the direct determinations of R<sub>K</sub>.</p><p>Since 1993, the BNM calculable capacitor, comparison bridges and transfer standards have been considerably modified and the value was determined anew in 1999–2000. The result is
    R<sub>K</sub> = R<sub>K−90</sub>×(1 + 4.1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) (1σ = 5.3×10<sup>−8</sup>)</p><p>This paper describes the different investigations, modifications and characterizations of the measurement chain elements that were carried out during the last fifteen years in order to obtain this result.</p>
