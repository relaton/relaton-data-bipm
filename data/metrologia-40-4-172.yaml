  content: "<p>In 2000, the Bureau National de Métrologie (BNM, France) decided to
    develop a new watt balance experiment. Among numerous design studies, the choice
    of the transfer mass is particularly important. Because of the proximity to a
    source of high magnetic intensity, this mass must have a magnetic susceptibility
    as weak as possible. Gold–platinum alloy seems to meet this requirement, as well
    as additional requirements for density and hardness values, making it a possible
    candidate for mass standard realization. Five different gold–platinum alloys were
    studied, their volume magnetic susceptibility ranging from −2.8×10<sup>−5</sup>
    to −2.1×10<sup>−5</sup> for two of them and from +1.1×10<sup>−5</sup> to +8.8×10<sup>−5</sup>
    for the other three.</p>"
