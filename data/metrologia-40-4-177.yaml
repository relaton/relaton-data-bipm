  content: "<p>A measurand θ of interest is the ratio of two other quantities, μ<sub><italic>p</italic></sub>
    and μ<sub><italic>q</italic></sub>. A measurement experiment is conducted and
    results <italic>P</italic> and <italic>Q</italic> are obtained as estimates of
    μ<sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and μ<sub><italic>q</italic></sub>. The ratio <italic>Y</italic>
    = <italic>P</italic>/<italic>Q</italic> is generally reported as the result for
    the measurand θ. In this paper we consider the problem of computing an uncertainty
    interval for θ having a prescribed confidence level of 1−α. Although an exact
    procedure, based on an approach due to Fieller, is available for this problem,
    it is well known that this procedure can lead to unbounded confidence regions
    in certain situations. As a result, practitioners often use various non-exact
    methods. One such non-exact method is based on the propagation-of-errors approach
    described in the ISO <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>
    to calculate a standard uncertainty <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>
    for <italic>Y</italic>. A confidence interval for θ with a presumed confidence
    level of 95% is obtained as [<italic>Y</italic>−2<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>,
    <italic>Y</italic>+2<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>]. In this
    paper we develop a highly accurate approximation for the coverage probability
    associated with the interval [<italic>Y</italic>−<italic>ku</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>,
    <italic>Y</italic>+<italic>ku</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>]. In particular,
    we demonstrate that, using <italic>n</italic>−1 degrees of freedom for <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>,
    and the corresponding Student's <italic>t</italic> coverage factor <italic>k</italic>
    = <italic>t</italic><sub>1−α/2 : <italic>n</italic>−1</sub> rather than <italic>k</italic>
    = 2, leads to uncertainty intervals [<italic>Y</italic>−<italic>t</italic><sub>1−α/2 : <italic>n</italic>−1</sub><italic>u</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>,
    <italic>Y</italic>+<italic>t</italic><sub>1−α/2 : <italic>n</italic>−1</sub><italic>u</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>],
    that are nearly identical to Fieller's exact intervals whenever the measurement
    relative uncertainties are small, as is the case in most metrological applications.
    In addition, they are easy to compute and may be recommended for routine use in
    metrological applications. Improved coverage factors <italic>k</italic> can be
    derived based on the results of this paper for those exceptional situations where
    the <italic>t</italic>-interval may not have coverage probability sufficiently
    close to the desired value.</p>"
