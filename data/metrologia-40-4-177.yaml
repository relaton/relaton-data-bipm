abstract:
- content: "<p>A measurand θ of interest is the ratio of two other quantities, μ<sub>p</sub>
    and μ<sub>q</sub>. A measurement experiment is conducted and results P and Q are
    obtained as estimates of μ<sub>p</sub> and μ<sub>q</sub>. The ratio Y = P/Q is
    generally reported as the result for the measurand θ. In this paper we consider
    the problem of computing an uncertainty interval for θ having a prescribed confidence
    level of 1−α. Although an exact procedure, based on an approach due to Fieller,
    is available for this problem, it is well known that this procedure can lead to
    unbounded confidence regions in certain situations. As a result, practitioners
    often use various non-exact methods. One such non-exact method is based on the
    propagation-of-errors approach described in the ISO Guide to the Expression of
    Uncertainty in Measurement to calculate a standard uncertainty u<sub>y</sub> for
    Y. A confidence interval for θ with a presumed confidence level of 95% is obtained
    as [Y−2u<sub>y</sub>, Y+2u<sub>y</sub>]. In this paper we develop a highly accurate
    approximation for the coverage probability associated with the interval [Y−ku<sub>y</sub>,
    Y+ku<sub>y</sub>]. In particular, we demonstrate that, using n−1 degrees of freedom
    for u<sub>y</sub>, and the corresponding Student's t coverage factor k = t<sub>1−α/2 : n−1</sub>
    rather than k = 2, leads to uncertainty intervals [Y−t<sub>1−α/2 : n−1</sub>u<sub>y</sub>,
    Y+t<sub>1−α/2 : n−1</sub>u<sub>y</sub>], that are nearly identical to Fieller's
    exact intervals whenever the measurement relative uncertainties are small, as
    is the case in most metrological applications. In addition, they are easy to compute
    and may be recommended for routine use in metrological applications. Improved
    coverage factors k can be derived based on the results of this paper for those
    exceptional situations where the t-interval may not have coverage probability
    sufficiently close to the desired value.</p>"
