abstract:
- content: "<p>A procedure for linking the results of a Regional Metrology Organisation
    (RMO) key comparison to those of a related Comité International des Poids et Mesures
    (CIPM) key comparison is proposed. The RMO results are linked to the CIPM results
    by a factor which is determined as the ratio of the CIPM key comparison reference
    value and the weighted mean of the RMO results of the linking laboratories. Correlations
    of the results of the linking laboratories in the two comparisons are taken into
    account. The uncertainties associated with the linked RMO results and the degrees
    of equivalence (DOEs) are explicitly given.</p><p>The influence of correlations
    of the results of the linking laboratories in both comparisons is examined. It
    is shown that these correlations can decrease the linking uncertainty, whereas
    DOEs are expected to be influenced less.</p><p>The proposed linking procedure
    is illustrated by its application to linking the results of a recent CIPM key
    comparison on accelerometer calibrations to that of a corresponding RMO key comparison.</p>"
