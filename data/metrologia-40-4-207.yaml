  content: "<p><italic>Evaluating the Measurement Uncertainty</italic> is a book written
    for anyone who makes and reports measurements.  It attempts to fill the gaps in
    the ISO  <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>,
    or the  <italic>GUM</italic>, and does a pretty thorough job.  The  <italic>GUM</italic>
    was written with the intent of being applicable by all metrologists, from the
    shop floor to the National Metrology Institute laboratory; however, the  <italic>GUM</italic>
    has often been criticized for its lack of user-friendliness because it is primarily
    filled with statements, but with little explanation.  <italic>Evaluating the Measurement
    Uncertainty</italic> gives lots of explanations.  It is well written and makes
    use of many good figures and numerical\nexamples.  Also important, this book is
    written by a metrologist from a National Metrology Institute, and therefore up-to-date
    ISO rules, style conventions and definitions are correctly used and supported
    throughout.  The author sticks very closely to the  <italic>GUM</italic> in topical
    theme and with frequent reference, so readers who have not read  <italic>GUM</italic>
    cover-to-cover may feel as if they are missing\nsomething.</p>\n<p>The first chapter
    consists of a reprinted lecture by T J Quinn, Director of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), on the role of metrology in today's world.  It is
    an interesting and informative essay that clearly outlines \nthe importance of
    metrology in our modern society, and why accurate measurement capability, and
    by definition uncertainty evaluation, should be so important.  Particularly interesting
    is the section on the need for accuracy rather than simply reproducibility.</p>\n<p><italic>Evaluating
    the Measurement Uncertainty</italic> then begins at the beginning, with basic
    concepts and definitions.  The third chapter carefully introduces the concept
    of standard uncertainty and includes many derivations and discussion of probability
    density functions.  The author also touches on Monte Carlo methods, calibration
    correction quantities, acceptance intervals or guardbanding, and many other interesting
    cases.  The book goes on to treat evaluation of expanded uncertainty, joint treatment
    of several measurands, least-squares adjustment, curve fitting and more.  Chapter
    6 is devoted to Bayesian inference.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one can say that  <italic>Evaluating
    the Measurement Uncertainty</italic> caters to a wider reader-base than the  <italic>GUM</italic>;
    however, a mathematical or statistical background is still advantageous.  Also,
    this is not a book with a library of\nworked overall uncertainty evaluations for
    various measurements; the feel of the book is rather theoretical.  The novice
    will still have some work to do—but this is a good place to start.  I think this
    book is a fitting companion to the  <italic>GUM</italic> because the text complements
    the  <italic>GUM</italic>, from fundamental principles to more sophisticated measurement
    situations, and moreover includes intelligent discussion regarding intent and
    interpretation.  <italic>Evaluating the Measurement Uncertainty</italic> is detailed,
    and I think most metrologists will really enjoy the detail and care put into this
    book.</p>\n<p><bold>Jennifer Decker</bold></p>"
