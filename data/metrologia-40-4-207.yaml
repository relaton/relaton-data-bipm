abstract:
- content: "<p>Evaluating the Measurement Uncertainty is a book written for anyone
    who makes and reports measurements. It attempts to fill the gaps in the ISO Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, or the GUM, and does a pretty
    thorough job. The GUM was written with the intent of being applicable by all metrologists,
    from the shop floor to the National Metrology Institute laboratory; however, the
    GUM has often been criticized for its lack of user-friendliness because it is
    primarily filled with statements, but with little explanation. Evaluating the
    Measurement Uncertainty gives lots of explanations. It is well written and makes
    use of many good figures and numerical\nexamples. Also important, this book is
    written by a metrologist from a National Metrology Institute, and therefore up-to-date
    ISO rules, style conventions and definitions are correctly used and supported
    throughout. The author sticks very closely to the GUM in topical theme and with
    frequent reference, so readers who have not read GUM cover-to-cover may feel as
    if they are missing\nsomething.</p><p>The first chapter consists of a reprinted
    lecture by T J Quinn, Director of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM), on the role of metrology in today's world. It is an interesting and informative
    essay that clearly outlines \nthe importance of metrology in our modern society,
    and why accurate measurement capability, and by definition uncertainty evaluation,
    should be so important. Particularly interesting is the section on the need for
    accuracy rather than simply reproducibility.</p><p>Evaluating the Measurement
    Uncertainty then begins at the beginning, with basic concepts and definitions.
    The third chapter carefully introduces the concept of standard uncertainty and
    includes many derivations and discussion of probability density functions. The
    author also touches on Monte Carlo methods, calibration correction quantities,
    acceptance intervals or guardbanding, and many other interesting cases. The book
    goes on to treat evaluation of expanded uncertainty, joint treatment of several
    measurands, least-squares adjustment, curve fitting and more. Chapter 6 is devoted
    to Bayesian inference.</p><p>Perhaps one can say that Evaluating the Measurement
    Uncertainty caters to a wider reader-base than the GUM; however, a mathematical
    or statistical background is still advantageous. Also, this is not a book with
    a library of\nworked overall uncertainty evaluations for various measurements;
    the feel of the book is rather theoretical. The novice will still have some work
    to do—but this is a good place to start. I think this book is a fitting companion
    to the GUM because the text complements the GUM, from fundamental principles to
    more sophisticated measurement situations, and moreover includes intelligent discussion
    regarding intent and interpretation. Evaluating the Measurement Uncertainty is
    detailed, and I think most metrologists will really enjoy the detail and care
    put into this book.</p><p>Jennifer Decker</p>"
