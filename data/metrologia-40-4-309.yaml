abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is described to relate the parameters appearing in interpolation
    equations for radiation thermometry directly to the radiometric characteristics
    of the thermometer itself. It is shown that for sufficiently narrow bandwidths
    these parameters are independent of the shape of the spectral responsivity and
    can be expressed solely in terms of its mean wavelength and bandwidth as determined
    by the variance. This allows the parameters to be determined either by direct
    measurement of the spectral responsivity, by measurements at fixed points, or
    by a combination of the two, in effect unifying the ITS-90, interpolation, and
    absolute thermometry methodologies for determining temperature. The development
    of high-temperature metal–carbon and metal-carbide–carbon eutectic fixed points
    means that temperatures up to and exceeding 3500 K may be determined by implementing
    a single simple interpolation equation in a variety of ways.</p>"
