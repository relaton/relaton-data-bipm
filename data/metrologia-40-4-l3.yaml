  content: "<p>Deviations from flatness of the gauging surfaces of material artefacts
    do not practically affect the results of new parallax-free methods of length measurements
    based on optical differential measurements (DM). The surface texture deformations,
    resulting from the wringing procedure of a gauge block to a reference plate and
    defined for the wringing contact without an excessive wringing film thickness,
    are highly reproducible and can be included in the definition of the mechanical
    length of a block without any tangible increase in the total uncertainty.</p>"
