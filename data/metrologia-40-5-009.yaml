abstract:
- content: "<p>An evaluation of the four-terminal-pair equal power 100 : 1, quadrature
    and 10 : 1 coaxial bridge systems for the traceable determination of NPL 10 pF
    primary capacitance standard from the DC quantum Hall effect is reported. This
    was instigated to resolve the small but significant discrepancies observed in
    the NPL measurements during the recent EUROMET and CCEM comparisons. A formal
    bilateral comparison between NPL and BIPM was conducted (involving EUROMET two-terminal-pair
    and BIPM three-terminal capacitance standards) to establish a new degree of equivalence
    between the two laboratories for the 10 pF and 100 pF capacitance measurements
    at 1 kHz and 1.592 kHz. The majority of results show agreement within the estimated
    2σ combined relative standard uncertainty of measurement of the two laboratories.
    However, the best agreement was obtained for the EUROMET two-terminal-pair 10 pF
    and 100 pF capacitance standards with a mean difference between NPL and BIPM results
    of (21.9 ± 117) nF/F and (51.4 ± 117) nF/F, respectively, at 1.592 kHz.</p>"
