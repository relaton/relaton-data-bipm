  content: "<p>Gas temperature gradients created during the filling stage of a pressure–volume–temperature–time
    (<italic>PVTt</italic>) calibration cycle, and those imposed by inhomogeneous
    room conditions, lead to uncertainties in the average gas temperature in the collection
    tank. Because these temperature uncertainties dominate the overall flow uncertainty,
    NIST upgraded the temperature-averaging scheme used in its 26 m<sup>3</sup> <italic>PVTt</italic>
    system. Instead of arithmetically averaging 10 thermistors to obtain the mean
    gas temperature, we now calculate this value via a volume-weighted trapezoidal
    integration procedure using 35 thermistors. Applying the new temperature-averaging
    scheme, the mean gas temperature can be determined with a standard uncertainty
    of 89 mK after only 2700 s of fan mixing. As a result, the flow uncertainty in
    the NIST 26 m<sup>3</sup> <italic>PVTt</italic> system has decreased from 0.22%
    to 0.13% (with a coverage factor of 2). This paper highlights the temperature
    improvements and presents a detailed analysis for estimating the lower temperature
    uncertainty.</p>"
