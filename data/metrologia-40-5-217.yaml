  content: "<p>This paper describes the main tests and precautions necessary for both
    reproducible and accurate results in the use of the quantum Hall effect as a means
    to establish a reference standard of dc resistance having a relative uncertainty
    of a few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>"
