abstract:
- content: "<p>We present an evaluation of the frequency shifts in an optically pumped
    caesium-beam frequency standard caused by the neighbouring transitions. We analyse
    the shifts caused by the Rabi and Ramsey pulling effects and find a well-known
    result for the Rabi pulling but a new result for the Ramsey pulling. The revised
    Ramsey shift is found to be proportional to not the imaginary but the real part
    of the ground-state atomic coherence. The value of the Ramsey shift is proportional
    to the first power of the Rabi frequency defined by a small orthogonal component
    of the microwave field and the inverse value of the Zeeman splitting. We compare
    the shifts caused by the neighbouring transitions and show that the relative contributions
    of the Rabi and Ramsey pulling effects crucially depend on the quality of optical
    pumping. We estimate that the Rabi shift for the KRISS-1 caesium-beam frequency
    standard is at a relative level of 10<sup>−14</sup> while the Ramsey shift is
    at a relative level of 10<sup>−12</sup>.</p>"
