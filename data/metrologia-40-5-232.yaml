abstract:
- content: "<p>Experiments, described below, revealed certain shortcomings of the
    current definition of the Al point: pressure in sealed type Al cells made of quartz
    was observed prior to their sealing and was found to steadily decrease. Consequently,
    the realized Al points using sealed quartz cells are in a state of drift. In addition,
    the initial Al point values yielded by open cells are higher than the subsequently
    realized ones: five different gases were used to apply the initial 1 atm pressure
    over the Al samples (air, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, He, CO<sub>2</sub>). Each of them
    appeared to contaminate slightly the Al samples, lowering the initial value of
    the Al point by 1 or 2 mK. However, sealed quartz triple point cells remained
    stable at their initial value indefinitely. Thus, the triple point of Al is a
    more reliable fixed point than the defining Al freezing point itself.</p>"
