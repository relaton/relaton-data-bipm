abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement is being increasingly recognized as a
    de facto international standard. The ISO Guide recommends a standardized way of
    expressing uncertainty in all kinds of measurements and provides a comprehensive
    approach for combining information to evaluate that uncertainty. The ISO Guide
    supports uncertainties evaluated from statistical methods, Type A, and uncertainties
    determined by other means, Type B. The ISO Guide recommends classical (frequentist)
    statistics for evaluating the Type A components of uncertainty; but it interprets
    the combined uncertainty from a Bayesian viewpoint. This is inconsistent. In order
    to overcome this inconsistency, we suggest that all Type A uncertainties should
    be evaluated through a Bayesian approach. It turns out that the estimates from
    a classical statistical analysis are either equal or approximately equal to the
    corresponding estimates from a Bayesian analysis with non-informative prior probability
    distributions. So the classical (frequentist) estimates may be used provided they
    are interpreted from the Bayesian viewpoint. The procedure of the ISO Guide for
    evaluating the combined uncertainty is to propagate the uncertainties associated
    with the input quantities. This procedure does not yield a complete specification
    of the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated
    combined standard uncertainty. So the correct coverage factor for a desired coverage
    probability of an expanded uncertainty interval cannot always be determined. Nonetheless,
    the ISO Guide suggests that the coverage factor may be computed by assuming that
    the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated standard
    uncertainty is a normal distribution or a scaled-and-shifted t-distribution with
    degrees of freedom determined from the Welchâ€“Satterthwaite formula. This assumption
    may be unjustified and the coverage factor so determined may be incorrect. A popular
    convention is to set the coverage factor as 2. When the distribution represented
    by the result of measurement and its associated standard uncertainty is not completely
    determined, the 2-standard-uncertainty interval may be interpreted in terms of
    its minimum coverage probability for an applicable class of probability distributions.</p>"
