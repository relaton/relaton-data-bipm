  content: "<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> is being increasingly
    recognized as a <italic>de facto</italic> international standard. The ISO <italic>Guide</italic>
    recommends a standardized way of expressing uncertainty in all kinds of measurements
    and provides a comprehensive approach for combining information to evaluate that
    uncertainty. The ISO <italic>Guide</italic> supports uncertainties evaluated from
    statistical methods, Type A, and uncertainties determined by other means, Type
    B. The ISO <italic>Guide</italic> recommends classical (frequentist) statistics
    for evaluating the Type A components of uncertainty; but it interprets the combined
    uncertainty from a Bayesian viewpoint. This is inconsistent. In order to overcome
    this inconsistency, we suggest that all Type A uncertainties should be evaluated
    through a Bayesian approach. It turns out that the estimates from a classical
    statistical analysis are either equal or approximately equal to the corresponding
    estimates from a Bayesian analysis with non-informative prior probability distributions.
    So the classical (frequentist) estimates may be used provided they are interpreted
    from the Bayesian viewpoint. The procedure of the ISO <italic>Guide</italic> for
    evaluating the combined uncertainty is to propagate the uncertainties associated
    with the input quantities. This procedure does not yield a complete specification
    of the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated
    combined standard uncertainty. So the correct coverage factor for a desired coverage
    probability of an expanded uncertainty interval cannot always be determined. Nonetheless,
    the ISO <italic>Guide</italic> suggests that the coverage factor may be computed
    by assuming that the distribution represented by the result of measurement and
    its associated standard uncertainty is a normal distribution or a scaled-and-shifted
    <italic>t</italic>-distribution with degrees of freedom determined from the Welchâ€“Satterthwaite
    formula. This assumption may be unjustified and the coverage factor so determined
    may be incorrect. A popular convention is to set the coverage factor as 2. When
    the distribution represented by the result of measurement and its associated standard
    uncertainty is not completely determined, the 2-standard-uncertainty interval
    may be interpreted in terms of its minimum coverage probability for an applicable
    class of probability distributions.</p>"
