  content: "<p>In the 1990s the CCQM (Comité consultatif pour la quantité de la matière)
    defined the term ‘primary method’. It also identified some methods that are considered
    to be primary. One of these methods is titrimetry. In this paper, the principle
    of titrimetry and two practical examples performed at the highest metrological
    level in the frame of key comparison CCQM-K8 are discussed. It is evident that
    titrimetry is a very powerful method leading to highly accurate results when performed
    correctly, and does not depend on whether the classical metrological approach
    or a new experimental design using modern laboratory technology is applied.</p>"
