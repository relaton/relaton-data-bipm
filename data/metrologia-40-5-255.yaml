  content: "<p>The term ‘metrology’ in its modern meaning of ‘science of measurement’
    has come into use only since the journal <italic>Metrologia</italic> was founded.
    Before this date, ‘metrology’ and synonymous terms which are likewise derived
    from the Greek word for measure were used in historical investigations on weights
    and measures only. In the present global development of science and economics,
    metrology plays a key role with the BIPM performing significant coordination tasks.</p>"
