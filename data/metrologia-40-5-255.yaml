abstract:
- content: "<p>The term ‘metrology’ in its modern meaning of ‘science of measurement’
    has come into use only since the journal Metrologia was founded. Before this date,
    ‘metrology’ and synonymous terms which are likewise derived from the Greek word
    for measure were used in historical investigations on weights and measures only.
    In the present global development of science and economics, metrology plays a
    key role with the BIPM performing significant coordination tasks.</p>"
