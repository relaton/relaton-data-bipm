  content: "<p>The inherent curvature of the wavefronts in the laser beams used in
    most absolute gravimeters introduces a systematic reduction in the measured gravity
    value. This error depends strongly on the diameter of the laser beam, but is typically
    of the order of 1–5 µGal. This paper describes the origin of this reduction, and
    provides a correction based on the laser beam diameter as well as a practical
    method to measure the beam's diameter.</p>"
