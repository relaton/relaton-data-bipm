abstract:
- content: "<p>Gas temperature gradients created during the filling stage of a pressure–volume–temperature–time
    (PVTt) calibration cycle, and those imposed by inhomogeneous room conditions,
    lead to uncertainties in the average gas temperature in the collection tank. Because
    these temperature uncertainties dominate the overall flow uncertainty, NIST upgraded
    the temperature-averaging scheme used in its 26 m<sup>3</sup> PVTt system. Instead
    of arithmetically averaging 10 thermistors to obtain the mean gas temperature,
    we now calculate this value via a volume-weighted trapezoidal integration procedure
    using 35 thermistors. Applying the new temperature-averaging scheme, the mean
    gas temperature can be determined with a standard uncertainty of 89 mK after only
    2700 s of fan mixing. As a result, the flow uncertainty in the NIST 26 m<sup>3</sup>
    PVTt system has decreased from 0.22% to 0.13% (with a coverage factor of 2). This
    paper highlights the temperature improvements and presents a detailed analysis
    for estimating the lower temperature uncertainty.</p>"
