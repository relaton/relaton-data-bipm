abstract:
- content: "<p>Degradation corrections to solar irradiance measurements in space along
    with a postulated ‘hyperbolic’ fitting formula were recently reported (Fröhlich
    2003 Metrologia 40 S60–5). A simpler, alternative formula based on broadband synchrotron
    exposure experiments on polymeric mixtures is presented. The alternative formula
    is shown to be similar to the hyperbolic function in the high photon dose limit.
    These results complement and reinforce the physical validity of the previously
    reported degradation corrections.</p>"
