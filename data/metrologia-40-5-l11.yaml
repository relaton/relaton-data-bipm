  content: <p>Degradation corrections to solar irradiance measurements in space along
    with a postulated ‘hyperbolic’ fitting formula were recently reported (Fröhlich

    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>40</bold> S60–5</ext-link>). A simpler, alternative
    formula based on broadband synchrotron exposure experiments on polymeric mixtures
    is presented. The alternative formula is shown to be similar to the hyperbolic
    function in the high photon dose limit. These results complement and reinforce
    the physical validity of the previously reported degradation corrections.</p>
