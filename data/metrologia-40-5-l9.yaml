abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, Kose et al (2003 Metrologia 40 146–53) proposed ‘general
    principles that should guide any future discussions regarding the redefinition
    of the SI base units’ and they illustrated their principles with an example of
    a revised SI. Part of their example (redefinition of the kelvin in terms of the
    triple point of hydrogen) is not consistent with their objective that all base
    units comply with ‘…the needs of economy, science and society’. An alternative
    revision of the SI might not define the kelvin as an independent unit.</p>"
