    any future discussions regarding the redefinition of the SI base units’ and they
    illustrated their principles with an example of a revised SI. Part of their example
    (redefinition of the kelvin in terms of the triple point of hydrogen) is not consistent
    with their objective that all base units comply with ‘…the needs of economy, science
    and society’. An alternative revision of the SI might not define the kelvin as
    an independent unit.</p>
