abstract:
- content: "<p>An experimental approach for linking the atomic mass unit to the kilogram
    with an uncertainty sufficiently small for a future re-definition of the kilogram
    is described. The concept consists of accumulation of ions from an ion beam up
    to a weighable mass and measurable total charge. The main problems and influencing
    factors connected with ion beam technology, weighing and current measurement together
    with the corresponding experimental solutions are discussed in detail. The first
    experiments with consistent results, but still large uncertainty, are described.</p>"
