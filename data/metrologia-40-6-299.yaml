  content: "<p>The present definition of the unit of mass in the International System
    (SI) is based on the international prototype of the kilogram, an artefact dating
    back to the 1880s. At present there is considerable effort worldwide aimed at
    replacing this artefact definition by one based on physical constants. This paper
    gives a brief history of the SI unit and how it is currently realized. The focus
    is on historical information, often forgotten, which has current relevance.</p>"
