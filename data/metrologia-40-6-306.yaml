  content: "<p>The techniques used for generating multiples and submultiples of the
    kilogram are reviewed, and their historical evolution is outlined. Emphasis is
    given to estimation of the values of the measurands, in connection with the need
    for prior knowledge about them. This need has deep motivation and implies the
    introduction of constraints on their values. The alternatives of deterministic
    constraints, leading to the Lagrangian multipliers method, and uncertain constraints,
    leading to the minimum variance estimator, are discussed, as well as the mathematical
    relationship between the two methods.</p>"
