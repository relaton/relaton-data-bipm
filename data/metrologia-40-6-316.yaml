abstract:
- content: "<p>A review is given of recent developments in the formulation of requirements
    of weighing where such measurements are performed in society and industry with
    legal implications such as safety, fair trade and environmental considerations.
    Traditional legal metrology in the area of weights and measures has been developed
    and given an expanded scope in recent years. This reflects, on the one hand, technical
    and scientific development (computerization of weighing devices, improved weight
    manufacturing and new methods of magnetism determination, for example), and on
    the other hand, administrative evolution (global requirements of the market and
    the Measurement Instrument Directive). Particularly fruitful has been the joint
    effort by the scientific mass metrology and legal metrology communities in the
    development in the last decade of international recommendations—especially OIML
    R111—on weighing. Consensus has been reached in the international weighing forum
    concerning important areas such as maximum permissible errors for weights, how
    to calculate measurement uncertainty and how measurement uncertainty should be
    accounted for in relation to conformity assessment. These international recommendations
    for weights as mass standards include both tolerances and extensive instructions
    about various influence quantities that affect the weight result, such as magnetization,
    surface roughness and volume of weights. Much remains to be done, however: corresponding
    requirements of weighing devices in particular need to meet the challenges of
    a rapidly changing technology. The promising collaboration between scientific
    and legal metrology initiated in the area of weights may act as a model and stimulate
    similar developments in other areas of metrology, particularly where requirements
    are generic (for instance uncertainty and conformity) or analogous.</p>"
