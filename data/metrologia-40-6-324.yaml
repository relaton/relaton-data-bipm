abstract:
- content: "<p>A review of published data on the stability of mass standards has been
    undertaken. The data mainly focus on the stability of platinumâ€“iridium mass standards,
    but data on stainless steel artefacts have also been included. The review has
    been divided into five areas: long-term stability of mass standards, surface effects
    due to humidity, effects of various cleaning techniques, analysis of surface contamination
    and the outgassing of surfaces in vacuum. Conclusions have been drawn from the
    data reviewed, and suggestions for future investigations are proposed.</p>"
