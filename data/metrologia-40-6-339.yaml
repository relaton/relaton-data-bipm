  content: "<p>Unwanted magnetic effects must be minimized and quantified in precision
    weighing and mass metrology. To this end, methods of measuring magnetic fields
    and of characterizing the magnetic properties of bodies such as weights are reviewed.
    The results of comparisons between weights made of ferromagnetic and weakly magnetic
    materials as well as modelling the magnetic forces between weight and balance
    are reported. Finally, the impact of the magnetic properties of the weights on
    regulations in legal metrology is discussed.</p>"
