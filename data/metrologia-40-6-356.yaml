abstract:
- content: "<p>Among the priority tasks in the further development of the International
    System of Units is the redefinition of the kilogram based on fundamental constants.
    One of the strategies pursued today is to relate mass to Planck's constant h using
    the equivalence between mechanical and electrical energies. In this paper, possible
    experimental approaches in this direction are described. The approach which promises
    to reach the required uncertainty at the earliest is the concept of the moving-coil
    watt balance. The status of the different watt balance experiments is reviewed
    in detail.</p>"
