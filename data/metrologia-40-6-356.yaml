- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Among the priority tasks in the further development of the International
    System of Units is the redefinition of the kilogram based on fundamental constants.
    One of the strategies pursued today is to relate mass to Planck's constant <italic>h</italic>
    using the equivalence between mechanical and electrical energies. In this paper,
    possible experimental approaches in this direction are described. The approach
    which promises to reach the required uncertainty at the earliest is the concept
    of the moving-coil watt balance. The status of the different watt balance experiments
    is reviewed in detail.</p>"
