abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes attempts to replace the present definition of
    the SI unit mass, the kilogram, by a new one, based on the atomic mass unit; the
    kilogram then becomes the mass of a certain number of silicon atoms. The related
    research is planned and is to be performed within the scope of a worldwide collaboration
    coordinated by the Working Group on the Avogadro Constant of the CIPM Consultative
    Committee for Mass and Related Quantities. This requires determination of the
    Avogadro constant, N<sub>A</sub>, with a relative uncertainty close to 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>.
    At present, the most important limiting factor is the uncertainty arising from
    observed differences between some primary density standards as well as the measurement
    of the molar mass of silicon, e.g. the determination of the natural isotopic composition.
    Improvements in crystal characterization and density determination are described
    that allow us to reach a relative uncertainty of about 10<sup>−7</sup>. A further
    reduction in the uncertainty is envisaged by measurements performed on a 99.99%
    enriched<sup>28</sup>Si single crystal.</p>"
