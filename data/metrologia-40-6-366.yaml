  content: "<p>This paper describes attempts to replace the present definition of
    the SI unit mass, the kilogram, by a new one, based on the atomic mass unit; the
    kilogram then becomes the mass of a certain number of silicon atoms. The related
    research is planned and is to be performed within the scope of a worldwide collaboration
    coordinated by the Working Group on the Avogadro Constant of the CIPM Consultative
    Committee for Mass and Related Quantities. This requires determination of the
    Avogadro constant, <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>, with a relative uncertainty
    close to 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. At present, the most important limiting factor is
    the uncertainty arising from observed differences between some primary density
    standards as well as the measurement of the molar mass of silicon, e.g. the determination
    of the natural isotopic composition. Improvements in crystal characterization
    and density determination are described that allow us to reach a relative uncertainty
    of about 10<sup>−7</sup>. A further reduction in the uncertainty is envisaged
    by measurements performed on a 99.99% enriched <sup>28</sup>Si single crystal.</p>"
