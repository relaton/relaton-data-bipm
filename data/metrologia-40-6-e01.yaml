  content: "<p>December 2003 marks the end of an era in the world of metrology with
    the \nretirement of Terry Quinn FRS, Director of the BIPM since 1988. Terry's
    \ncontribution to the field of metrology has been long and distinguished, \nboth
    as a physicist and administrator; a long list of awards and honours \nbears testimony
    to the fact.</p>\n<p>From the standpoint of physics, his contributions have been
    numerous and \nimportant: in the field of thermometry he pioneered the use of
    cryogenic \nradiometers, instruments that are now employed as standards by National
    \nMetrology Institutes (NMIs) worldwide; his experiments to measure the \nNewtonian
    gravitational constant,  <italic>G</italic>, the least well known of the \nfundamental
    constants, are characterized by elegant techniques and novel \napproaches; and
    as an example from the field of mass measurement, a \ndefinitive experiment at
    the BIPM ruled out the existence of the so-called \n'fifth force'.</p>\n<p>As
    Director of the BIPM, Terry Quinn has been the driving force behind many \nof
    the initiatives undertaken in metrology in recent years. As any delegate \nto
    conferences or meetings at the BIPM will testify, his knowledge and \ngrasp of
    complex issues are formidable, abilities that are particularly \ndemonstrated
    at meetings of the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures \n(CGPM), where many
    questions of a technical or diplomatic nature are often \nraised. The signing
    of the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) at the CGPM \nin Paris in 1999 by the
    directors of the NMIs of the industrialized states \nof the world was largely
    due to his efforts.</p>\n<p>In paying tribute to Terry, it would be remiss not
    to mention the part \nplayed by his charming wife, Renée. She has graciously hosted
    innumerable \nfunctions at the Quinn home over these years and has always made
    visitors \nto the BIPM feel most welcome. On behalf of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>,
    its readers \nand Editorial Board, I take this opportunity to wish the Quinns
    a long and \nhappy retirement. At the same time our best wishes go to Terry's
    successor, \nProfessor Andrew Wallard, another highly honoured metrologist, into
    whose \ncapable hands the Directorship of the BIPM will pass in January 2004.</p>\n<p>Finally,
    I am delighted to inform readers that starting with Volume 41, the \neditorial
    chair will be occupied by Dr Jeffrey Williams. Coming from a \ndistinguished research
    career in chemical physics and with wide experience \nin several high-profile
    posts in the area of publications, Jeffrey is well \nequipped to expand the horizons
    of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> in the post-MRA \nworld. With the knowledge that
    I leave the journal in safe hands, I wish \nhim every success. From my own part,
    it has been an exhilarating five and a \nhalf years spent at the BIPM, a period
    I shall always look back on with the \ngreatest of pleasure. I take this opportunity
    to thank my colleagues here \nat  <italic>Metrologia</italic>, the members of
    the Editorial Board, reviewers, \nauthors and many friends who have contributed
    in no small measure to make \nmy stay a most enjoyable one.</p>"
