abstract:
- content: "<p>December 2003 marks the end of an era in the world of metrology with
    the \nretirement of Terry Quinn FRS, Director of the BIPM since 1988. Terry's
    \ncontribution to the field of metrology has been long and distinguished, \nboth
    as a physicist and administrator; a long list of awards and honours \nbears testimony
    to the fact.</p><p>From the standpoint of physics, his contributions have been
    numerous and \nimportant: in the field of thermometry he pioneered the use of
    cryogenic \nradiometers, instruments that are now employed as standards by National
    \nMetrology Institutes (NMIs) worldwide; his experiments to measure the \nNewtonian
    gravitational constant,  G, the least well known of the \nfundamental constants,
    are characterized by elegant techniques and novel \napproaches; and as an example
    from the field of mass measurement, a \ndefinitive experiment at the BIPM ruled
    out the existence of the so-called \n'fifth force'.</p><p>As Director of the BIPM,
    Terry Quinn has been the driving force behind many \nof the initiatives undertaken
    in metrology in recent years. As any delegate \nto conferences or meetings at
    the BIPM will testify, his knowledge and \ngrasp of complex issues are formidable,
    abilities that are particularly \ndemonstrated at meetings of the Conférence Générale
    des Poids et Mesures \n(CGPM), where many questions of a technical or diplomatic
    nature are often \nraised. The signing of the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA)
    at the CGPM \nin Paris in 1999 by the directors of the NMIs of the industrialized
    states \nof the world was largely due to his efforts.</p><p>In paying tribute
    to Terry, it would be remiss not to mention the part \nplayed by his charming
    wife, Renée. She has graciously hosted innumerable \nfunctions at the Quinn home
    over these years and has always made visitors \nto the BIPM feel most welcome.
    On behalf of  Metrologia, its readers \nand Editorial Board, I take this opportunity
    to wish the Quinns a long and \nhappy retirement. At the same time our best wishes
    go to Terry's successor, \nProfessor Andrew Wallard, another highly honoured metrologist,
    into whose \ncapable hands the Directorship of the BIPM will pass in January 2004.</p><p>Finally,
    I am delighted to inform readers that starting with Volume 41, the \neditorial
    chair will be occupied by Dr Jeffrey Williams. Coming from a \ndistinguished research
    career in chemical physics and with wide experience \nin several high-profile
    posts in the area of publications, Jeffrey is well \nequipped to expand the horizons
    of  Metrologia in the post-MRA \nworld. With the knowledge that I leave the journal
    in safe hands, I wish \nhim every success. From my own part, it has been an exhilarating
    five and a \nhalf years spent at the BIPM, a period I shall always look back on
    with the \ngreatest of pleasure. I take this opportunity to thank my colleagues
    here \nat  Metrologia, the members of the Editorial Board, reviewers, \nauthors
    and many friends who have contributed in no small measure to make \nmy stay a
    most enjoyable one.</p>"
