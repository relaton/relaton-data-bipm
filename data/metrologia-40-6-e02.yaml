- content: "<p>This special issue is intended to present a review of mass standards,
    mass determination and the efforts to replace the international prototype of the
    kilogram by a new definition of the kilogram based on a fundamental constant of
    physics.</p><p>Mass is a quantity that is familiar to everybody primarily for
    its importance in commerce. It is not only one of the traditional quantities of
    metrology but also of science in general. The unit of mass has always been based
    on a material object and, since 1889, on the international prototype of the kilogram.
    The mass of any standard weight is derived from this prototype by a cascade of
    comparison measurements using balances. The sources of uncertainty of the mass
    of a standard depend upon the circumstances of the weighing process and the long-term
    instabilities of the intermediate standards. The international prototype—its mass
    is one kilogram by definition—may also suffer from instabilities or drifts in
    time, but until now it has not been possible to check this by comparison with
    a fundamental constant in physics. Repeated verifications of some 40 or so national
    prototypes of the members of the Metre Convention have shown significant drifts
    with an average of about 50 µg within 100 years, a fact that casts doubt on the
    stability of the international prototype itself. Experiments have been underway
    for about 30 years on linking fundamental constants such as the Avogadro constant
    or, correspondingly, the atomic mass unit and Planck's constant to the kilogram.
    Relative uncertainties of the order of 10<sup>-7</sup> have been reached today,
    still one order of magnitude too large for monitoring the stability of the international
    prototype or for a new definition.</p><p>The first article of this special issue
    gives information on the international and the national prototypes of the kilogram,
    its material, manufacture, cleaning procedures, stability investigations and the
    periodic verifications of national prototypes.</p><p>The next article describes
    methods for determining the mass of multiples and submultiples of the kilogram.
    In practice, mass standards in the range from one milligram up to several thousands
    of kilograms are used for the mass determination of commercial objects or for
    the calibration of weighing instruments. The determination of the mass of multiples
    and submultiples of the kilogram is a procedure that links such mass standards
    to the kilogram by a number of—mostly redundant—weighing processes and mathematical
    procedures that result in the values and the uncertainties of the standards involved.</p><p>The
    reproducibility of E-class weights is the topic of the next article. Classification
    of  weights is defined in an international recommendation for legal metrology
    and is carried over into the national regulations of most countries. E-class weights
    are at the highest level in this context. Reproducibility is related to the instability
    of mass standards within some time interval. Corresponding observations and discussions
    of the results are reported.</p><p>As already mentioned, weighing is an important
    source of the uncertainty of a mass standard. The requirements on weighing in
    legal metrology are discussed in the following article. It refers to the project
    of a new international recommendation for weights (revised OIML R 111) that describes
    procedures for mass determination and for testing the properties of weights according
    to the stated requirements for the different classes.</p><p>The instability of
    mass standards is mostly due to surface contamination. A review of the stability
    of platinum–iridium and stainless-steel standards and their surface contamination
    is presented in the next article. It gives a comprehensive overview of published
    data and investigations on this topic.</p><p>Magnetic weights interact with the
    magnetic field generated by a balance. A change in the balance indication is the
    consequence if certain limits are exceeded.  Magnetic properties of weights, their
    measurements and magnetic interactions between weights and balances constitute
    the theme of the next article. After an introduction to the theoretical aspects
    of magnetic fields and magnetic forces, different measurement methods, international
    comparisons in this field, modelling the interacting forces and finally the impact
    on the new international recommendation for weights are presented.</p><p>The moving-coil
    Watt balance and the superconducting magnetic levitation experiment are two of
    the experiments aimed at redefining the kilogram. 'Tracing Planck's constant to
    the kilogram by electromechanical methods' is the title of the corresponding article.
    It describes the principles of these experiments and reviews the efforts and results
    achieved at present in the laboratories concerned.</p><p>Another approach to redefining
    the kilogram is reviewed in the article entitled 'Tracing the definition of the
    kilogram to the Avogadro constant using a silicon single crystal'. This approach
    is performed in a worldwide collaboration coordinated by the Working Group on
    the Avogadro Constant of the CIPM Consultative Committee for Mass and related
    quantities.</p><p>An experiment for determining the atomic mass unit by ion accumulation
    follows a straightforward way for determining the mass of an atom by collecting
    ions, weighing and 'counting' them by measuring their total charge. This article
    reports on a 'third' way of redefining the kilogram. This approach is followed
    by only one laboratory and it is still at an early stage compared with the uncertainties
    already achieved by the other ones.</p>"
