abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper is a review of methods and techniques used for precise measurement
    of time intervals (TIs) or precise conversion of TIs to digital data. The following
    methods are described: the counter method and averaging, time stretching, time-to-amplitude
    conversion followed by analogue-to-digital conversion, the Vernier method, conversion
    utilizing tapped delay lines, and interpolation methods. Special attention has
    been paid to converters utilizing integrated delay lines for digital conversion
    of TIs, including designs with phase-locked loop and delay-locked loop circuits.
    This review is illustrated by design examples and contains a comprehensive list
    of references.</p>"
