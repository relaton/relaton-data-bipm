abstract:
- content: "<p>The objective of this work is to present a metrology study necessary
    for the accreditation of audiometer calibration procedures at the National Brazilian
    Institute of Metrology Standardization and Industrial Quality—INMETRO. A model
    for the calculation of measurement uncertainty was developed. Metrological aspects
    relating to audiometer calibration, traceability and measurement uncertainty were
    quantified through comparison between results obtained at the Industrial Noise
    Laboratory—LARI of the Federal University of Santa Catarina—UFSC and the Laboratory
    of Electric/acoustics—LAETA of INMETRO. Similar metrological performance of the
    measurement system used in both laboratories was obtained, indicating that the
    interlaboratory results are compatible with the expected values. The uncertainty
    calculation was based on the documents: EA-4/02 Expression of the Uncertainty
    of Measurement in Calibration (European Co-operation for Accreditation 1999 EA-4/02
    p 79) and Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (International
    Organization for Standardization 1993 1st edn, corrected and reprinted in 1995,
    Geneva, Switzerland). Some sources of uncertainty were calculated theoretically
    (uncertainty type B) and other sources were measured experimentally (uncertainty
    type A). The global value of uncertainty calculated for the sound pressure levels
    (SPLs) is similar to that given by other calibration institutions. The results
    of uncertainty related to measurements of SPL were compared with the maximum uncertainties
    U<sub>max</sub> given in the standard IEC 60645-1: 2001 (International Electrotechnical
    Commission 2001 IEC 60645-1 Electroacoustics—Audiological Equipment—Part 1:—Pure-Tone
    Audiometers).</p>"
