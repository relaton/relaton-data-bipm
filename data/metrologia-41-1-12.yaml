abstract:
- content: "<p>The results from the first international comparison of profile and
    helix measurements between the national metrological institutes (NMIs) or their
    representatives of Germany, USA and UK are presented. The comparison was organized
    and coordinated by the UK National Gear Metrology Laboratory. The results from
    measurements on a 200 mm diameter helix master and a 200 mm diameter profile show
    that differences in slope error parameters are within the measurement uncertainty
    claimed by individual NMIs. The results should become the basis for the mutual
    acceptance of measurands for gears, in the calibration measurement capability
    list of EUROMET.</p>"
