abstract:
- content: "<p>An analysis is presented that allows the interpolation errors to be
    determined for radiation thermometers calibrated through the use of interpolation
    equations. For a given spectral responsivity shape, the errors depend only on
    the mean wavelength and relative bandwidth of the spectral responsivity, and on
    the temperature range over which the equation is used. This allows the interpolation
    errors for all applications of radiation thermometry to be summarized in a simple
    form and provides a guide to the selection of mean wavelength and bandwidth for
    a given application so that the interpolation error can be rendered negligible.
    The analysis is demonstrated by evaluating the interpolation errors for the widely
    used Wien and Planck versions of the Sakumaâ€“Hattori interpolation equation.</p>"
