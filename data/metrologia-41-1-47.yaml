abstract:
- content: "<p>The thermodynamic temperature of the melting point of palladium in
    air was measured by noise thermometric methods. The temperature measurement was
    based on noise comparison using a two-channel arrangement to eliminate parasitic
    noises of electronic components by cross correlation. Three miniature fixed points
    filled with pure palladium (purity: ∼99.99%, mass: ∼90 g) were used to realize
    the melts of the fixed point metal. The measured melting temperature of palladium
    in air amounted to 1552.95 °C ± 0.21 K (k = 2). This temperature is 0.45 K lower
    than the temperature of the melting point of palladium measured by radiation thermometry.</p>"
