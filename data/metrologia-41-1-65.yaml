abstract:
- content: "<p>Direct phase-coherent measurements of the absolute frequency of the
    11-5, R(127) transition in<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at 633 nm of the BIPM4 He–Ne
    laser have been made. This laser has been used as a reference laser for a large
    number of international comparisons over the years and, as such, has served as
    the connecting point for the national implementation of the SI metre in the member
    states of the Metre Convention. The frequency value found for the f-component
    was 473 612 353 605.4 kHz with a combined uncertainty of 1.8 kHz, a value in close
    agreement with the value adopted for this radiation in the list of recommended
    radiations for the realization of the metre, which is 473 612 353 604 kHz.</p>"
