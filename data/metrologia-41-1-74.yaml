abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured the differences between the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature
    and the temperature of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 on nine isotherms
    between the triple point of mercury and 380 K, by means of a primary acoustic
    thermometer. For the present measurements the standard uncertainty of (T − T<sub>90</sub>)
    ranges from 0.9 mK at 234 K to 1.7 mK at 380 K. The experimental method is based
    on the measurement of the acoustic resonance frequencies of an argon-filled spherical
    cavity and the microwave resonance frequencies of the same cavity when evacuated.
    The present results agree within the remarkably small combined uncertainties with
    both NIST acoustic thermometry ([1] Moldover M R et al 1999 J. Res. Natl Inst.
    Stand. Technol. 104 11–46; [2] Strouse G F et al 2002 Progress in primary acoustic
    thermometry at NIST: 273 K to 505 K 8th Temperature Symp. (Chicago, 21–24 October
    2002)) and UCL acoustic thermometry ([3] Ewing M B and Trusler J P M 2000 J. Chem.
    Thermodyn. 32 1229–55) in the overlapping temperature range.</p>"
