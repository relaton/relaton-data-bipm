  content: "<p>We have measured the differences between the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature
    and the temperature of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 on nine isotherms
    between the triple point of mercury and 380 K, by means of a primary acoustic
    thermometer. For the present measurements the standard uncertainty of (<italic>T</italic>
    − <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>) ranges from 0.9 mK at 234 K to 1.7 mK at 380 K.
    The experimental method is based on the measurement of the acoustic resonance
    frequencies of an argon-filled spherical cavity and the microwave resonance frequencies
    of the same cavity when evacuated. The present results agree within the remarkably
    small combined uncertainties with both NIST acoustic thermometry ([1] Moldover
