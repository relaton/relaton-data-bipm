abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to calibrate highly accurate barometers, laser/ultrasonic
    mercury manometers have been used. However, the complexity and cost of mercury
    manometers have gradually taken them out of use in most calibration laboratories.
    As a substitute, a gas-operated pressure balance is used to calibrate precise
    barometers. In such a case, many commercially available pressure balances are
    not desirable because the consequent exposure of the piston, cylinder and masses
    to the atmosphere causes the problem of contamination and the ingress of dust
    particles to the gap between the piston and cylinder. In this paper, a novel weight-loading
    device for changing the masses in situ without breaking the vacuum is described.
    This device makes it possible to add or remove weights easily in the absolute
    mode, thereby greatly reducing the time between observations. Using this device
    we could easily calibrate a precise quartz resonance barometer (Paroscientific,
    Model 760-16B) from 940 hPa to 1050 hPa.</p>"
