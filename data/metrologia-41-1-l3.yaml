  content: "<p>The BIPM primary standards for air kerma in x-rays are changed following
    the adoption of new values for certain correction factors. The changes are effective
    from 1 October 2003 and result in corresponding changes to the calibration coefficients
    issued by the BIPM for the calibration of national secondary standards for x-rays.</p>"
