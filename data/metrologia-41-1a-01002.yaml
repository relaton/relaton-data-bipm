abstract:
- content: "<p>Key comparisons CCEM-K8 and EUROMET.EM-K8 on DC voltage ratio were
    carried out in parallel, both having the Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale G Ferraris
    (IEN) as the pilot laboratory. Two Datron 4902S voltage dividers were used as
    travelling standards, each divider being dedicated to one comparison. On these
    dividers the measurements of the ratios 1000 V/10 V and 100 V/10 V were mandatory
    and were used to evaluate the degrees of equivalence of the participants with
    respect to the reference value of their own comparison.</p><p>The reference value
    of a key comparison carried out by a Consultative Committee of the CIPM, like
    CCEM-K8, is called the Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV), and the degrees
    of equivalence of a regional comparison, like EUROMET.EM-K8, must be translated
    in terms of the KCRV. The two comparisons under study concern the measurement
    of voltage ratios, hence no national standard is involved. Then any participant
    in both comparisons can be considered equally able, in principle, to perform an
    unbiased measurement of the travelling standard. Since the number of participants
    in each comparison is significant and different methods of measurement were used,
    it is unlikely that the corresponding comparison reference value is affected by
    systematic errors. The degrees of equivalence with respect to the KCRV of the
    participants in EUROMET.EM-K8 are then the same as those with respect to the reference
    value of EUROMET.EM-K8.</p><p>The extended linking document reports a verification
    of such an assumption, based on the results of the common laboratories of the
    two comparisons.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click

    the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The linkage report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
