abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparison CCEM-K8.1 is a follow-up to comparison CCEM-K8 and was organized
    for those participants in CCEM-K8 willing to improve their results. The same travelling
    standard as in CCEM-K8, a Datron 4902S DC resistive divider, was used, but the
    trimmers of the divider were adjusted in order to change the deviation of the
    divider's ratios from nominal value. The comparison protocol was the same as for
    CCEM-K8 and requested the measurement of voltage ratios 1000 V/10 V and 100 V/10 V,
    the measurement of other ratios being optional. Two laboratories participated,
    but one of them withdrew before the draft A report was released. In the comparison's
    final report the results of the other laboratory, CEM from Spain, are linked to
    those of comparison CCEM-K8 through the measurements of IEN, which was the pilot
    laboratory of both comparisons.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
