  content: "<p>This is the final report on the APMP bilateral supplementary comparison
    in RF power measurement P1-APMP.EM.RF-S4. The purpose of the comparison is to
    \ndetermine the level of consistency of calibration results given by two \nnational
    standards laboratories.</p>\n<p>This is a comparison of one of the high-frequency
    key quantities. The comparison\nprotocol was based on that used in the key comparison
    CCEM.RF-K8; however,\nthe frequency points differ. One of the participants, the
    National Measurement\nLaboratory, also took part in CCEM.RF-K8.</p>\n<p>The travelling
    standard is a Hewlett-Packard 8478B thermistor mount, with a type-N\nmale RF connector.
    The calibration factor is determined at a number of frequencies\nbetween 30 MHz
    and 3000 MHz, together with an appropriate statement of uncertainty. \nMeasurements
    have been made at a nominal power level of 1 mW. The value\nof the reflection
    coefficient is also determined, as it is needed for the uncertainty\ncalculation.</p>\n<p>The
    pilot laboratory was the National Measurement Laboratory, in Australia, and\nthe
    comparison coordinator was the Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand.</p>\n<p>This
    report contains a brief description of the measurement set-ups at each laboratory\nand
    a summary of the associated uncertainty budgets. The actual measurements\nfrom
    each laboratory are presented as they appear in calibration certificates from\nthe
    respective laboratories.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold> To reach the main text

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the APMP,
    according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
