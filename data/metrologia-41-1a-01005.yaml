    <p>A bilateral supplementary comparison of resistance, APMP.EM-S6, was conducted between the National Institute of Metrology Thailand (NIMT) and the CSIRO National Measurement Laboratory of Australia (NML).  The comparison covered seven values of resistance, 0.1 Ω, 1 Ω, 100 Ω, 10 kΩ, 100 kΩ, 1 MΩ and 100 MΩ. The 0.1 Ω resistor was a YEW type 2792, the 100 MΩ resistor was an IET type SRC and the other five resistors were Fluke type 742A.</p>
    <p>The resistors were supplied by NIMT, and NML was the pilot laboratory for the comparison. The measurements for the comparison were made between December 2003 and April 2004.

    The resistors were measured on three separate occasions by NIMT and between each of these occasions the resistors were sent to NML for measurement. The resistors of nominal values  0.1 Ω, 1 Ω, 100 Ω and 10 kΩ were measured as four-terminal resistors while the 100 kΩ, 1 MΩ and 100 MΩ resistors were measured as two-terminal resistors.</p>
    <p>The quantity  <italic>E<sub>n</sub></italic> (the absolute value of the difference between the values obtained at the two laboratories divided by the root sum square of the expanded uncertainties of the two values) was calculated for each resistance value used in the comparison.  In all cases  <italic>E<sub>n</sub></italic> was less than 0.5.</p>
