    <p>During its 13th meeting in 1994 the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) decided to carry out a comparison of luminous responsivity to be organized by the BIPM. This comparison was classified as a key comparison by the 14th CCPR in 1997 and subsequently named CCPR-K3.b.</p>
    <p>Fifteen laboratories took part in this comparison by sending calibrated photometers to the BIPM. The photometers were compared with a common set of reference photometers to deduce the relative differences between the calibrations made in the participating laboratories.</p>
    <p>
    In this report the details of the procedure and the results are presented.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
