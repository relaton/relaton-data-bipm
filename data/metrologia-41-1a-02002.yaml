    <p>Luminous responsivity is a Key Comparison quantity for the Consultative Committee on Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), linked to the SI unit for luminous intensity, the candela. The CCPR completed a comparison of luminous responsivity in 1998, subsequently designated CCPR-K3.b. This document reports the method and results of an international comparison of luminous responsivity within the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP), following the protocols as laid down for the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the General Conference of Weights and Measures (CIPM).</p><p>The comparison was made by circulating two photometers which were calibrated by all participants. From the calibration results the coordinating laboratory established the differences between the national standards.</p><p>The common participation of two laboratories allows the results of the APMP and the CCPR comparison to be combined.</p><p>Main text.
