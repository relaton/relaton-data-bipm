    <p>A bilateral comparison of illuminance responsivity scales between the KRISS and the HUT was carried out, where the HUT acted as the pilot and link to the key comparison
    CCPR-K3.b. The ratio of the measured illuminance responsivities (KRISS/HUT) was 0.9982, with expanded uncertainty of 0.0060 (<italic>k</italic> = 2) including the uncertainty of the comparison and the uncertainties of the realization of the scales.</p>
