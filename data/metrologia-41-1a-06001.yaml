- content: |-
    <p>In 1983, the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) submitted two ampoules of known activity of<sup>47</sup>Sc to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The activities were about 1.1 MBq and 2.2 MBq. The same solution was used in a EUROMET comparison, held in 1983, the results of which have been approved for provisional equivalence for this radionuclide. This has enabled two national metrology institutes (NMIs) to link their results through that of the IRMM so that the degrees of equivalence between the three laboratories can be given in the form of a matrix.</p><p>Main text.
