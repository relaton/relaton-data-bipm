    <p>Since 1975, six national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted eight samples of known activity of<sup>113</sup>Sn to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Sn-113 at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The activities ranged from about 0.9 MBq to 22 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each NMI have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the six NMIs.</p><p>Main text.
