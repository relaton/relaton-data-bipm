    <p>Since 1983, five national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted eight samples of known activity of  <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup> to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with  comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m. The activities ranged from about 5 MBq to 1 GBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for five NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
