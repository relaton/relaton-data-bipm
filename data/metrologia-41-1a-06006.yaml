    <p>Since 1975, eight national metrology institutes (NMI) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) have submitted 25 samples of known activity of  <sup>85</sup>Sr to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the BIPM. The activities ranged from about 0.2 MBq to 9.5 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for seven NMIs and the BIPM. A graphical presentation is also given. </p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Sr-85, according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
