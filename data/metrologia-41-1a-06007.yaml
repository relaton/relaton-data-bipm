- content: |-
    <p>Since 1976, seven national metrology institutes (NMIs) and an international organization have submitted 20 samples of known activity of<sup>75</sup>Se to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Se-75. The activities ranged from about 1.4 MBq to 15 MBq. The results of a CCRI(II) comparison held in 1992 for this radionuclide, with comparison identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Se-75, are linked to the BIPM comparison for 18 participants through individual measurements of the comparison ampoules in the SIR. This has enabled six NMIs to update their earlier SIR results and another 11 NMIs and the BIPM to have degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database (KCDB). The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for 18 NMIs and the BIPM. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.
