    <p>The Russian (VNIIM) and French (BNM-LNHB) national primary laboratories organized in 1997 a bilateral comparison in beta dosimetry. This comparison of national standards, EUROMET.RI(I)-S2.B2, was carried out through a transfer ionization chamber manufactured by the VNIIM. The calibration factors of this chamber were determined by both laboratories in terms of absorbed dose rate at 7 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> of tissue depth, for the beta radiation fields of<sup>90</sup>Sr–<sup>90</sup>Y,<sup>204</sup>Tl and<sup>147</sup>Pm.</p><p>Main text.
