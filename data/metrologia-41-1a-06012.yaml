- content: |-
    <p>Since 1998, four national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted seven samples of known activity of<sup>153</sup>Sm to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Sm-153. The activities ranged from about 125 MBq to 180 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for four NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.
