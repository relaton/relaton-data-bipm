    <p>This report describes the first CCM key comparison in capillary viscometry at eleven national metrology institutes (NMIs), which was carried out between May and July 2002. Furthermore, seven NMIs which do not maintain an independent viscosity scale took part in this comparison. Five Newtonian liquids with nominal kinematic viscosities of 10 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 20 °C, 1300 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 20 °C, 400 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 40 °C, 40 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 100 °C and 40000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 20 °C were used to determine the degrees of equivalence between the individual NMIs and the key comparison reference value (KCRV). The relative standard uncertainty of the KCRV extends from 0.05% at 400 mm<sup>2</sup>/s to 0.15% at 40 mm<sup>2</sup>/s and 100 °C. From the total number of 74 measurements carried out by all the participating NMIs, 18 showed a deviation from the KCRV greater than was covered by the measurement uncertainty.</p>
