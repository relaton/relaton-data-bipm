    <p>This report summarizes the results of a comparison of 1 kg mass standards conducted between 15 participating members of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme. The comparison commenced on 15 August 1999 and concluded on 20 April 2001. Two 1 kg OIML weights (Class E1) were used as travelling artifacts. They were enclosed in a wooden box, then placed in an aluminium container. There was no funding provided for the programme; however, the two artifacts were donated by Mettler Toledo, Switzerland. The National Institute of Metrology (Thailand) (NIMT) acted as coordinating laboratory for the programme. The majority of the results of the participating laboratories are consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of comparison CCM.M-K1 to which this comparison is linked.</p>
