abstract:
- content: "<p>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) consist of 209 possible congeners
    depending on the substitution of the chlorine atoms around the biphenyl molecule.
    \ PCBs have been widely used as industrial fluids, flame retardants, diluents,
    hydraulic fluids, and dielectric fluids for capacitors and transformers.  As a
    class of compounds, they are environmentally stable and tend to bioaccumulate.
    \ Of the 209 possible congeners, approximately 150 congeners have been reported
    in the environment.  Congener-specific PCB methods, which are typically based
    on gas chromatography (GC) with electron capture detection (ECD) or mass spectrometric
    (MS) detection, are designed to measure selected priority congeners, but the congeners
    of interest change with the study and sponsoring agency.</p><p>A pilot study (CCQM-P17)
    for the determination of PCB congeners in sediment was organized by NIST and NRC-Canada
    in 2000.  Ten laboratories participated in the pilot study.  After discussion
    and critical review of the data, there was agreement that the pilot study should
    be followed by a Key Comparison and that the Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV)
    should be derived from isotope dilution GC/MS (ID-GC/MS) based methods that had
    been validated in the Pilot Study.</p><p>The CCQM-K25 Key Comparison study utilized
    a sediment sample prepared by mixing known quantities of two sediment materials
    to simulate a moderately contaminated sample with respect to PCBs. Nine laboratories
    participated in CCQM-K25 and demonstrated a high level of equivalence in capabilities
    for determining five PCB congeners (congener numbers 28, 101, 105, 153, and 170)
    in a moderately contaminated sediment using GC/MS-based methods. The amount of
    substance concentration for the congeners measured ranged from  ~10 ng/g to ~35
    ng/g.  The relative expanded uncertainties of the KCRVs ranged from 2% to 5%,
    indicating excellent agreement among the participants that used ID-GC/MS. Results
    from the one laboratory that used GC/MS with a non-labeled PCB congener as internal
    standard showed no systematic bias from the results of other laboratories.</p><p>The
    five PCB congeners measured in CCQM-K25 were selected to be representative of
    the approximately 150 congeners found in environmental samples and to provide
    the typical analytical measurement challenges encountered in the measurement of
    individual congeners such as volatility losses during sample preparation and coelution
    during chromatographic separation. The abilities demonstrated by the laboratories
    that provided comparable measurements for all five congeners in this Key Comparison
    should be indicative of their ability to provide reference measurements for the
    typical suite of PCB congeners found in moderately contaminated sediments (individual
    congener amount of substance concentrations &gt;5 ng/g dry basis).</p><p> Main
