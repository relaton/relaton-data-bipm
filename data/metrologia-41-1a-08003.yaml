    <p>This key comparison 'Ca in Serum' is a follow-up to the pilot study P14. The aim of the study is to demonstrate and document the capability of national metrology institutes to measure the Ca amount content in a serum sample. The comparison was an activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM and was piloted by the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Geel, Belgium).</p><p>The following laboratories participated in this key comparison (in alphabetical order):<p>CENAM (Mexico)</p><p>CSIR-NML (South Africa)</p><p>IAEA (International Organization)</p><p>IRMM (European Union)</p><p>KRISS (South Korea)</p><p>LGC (United Kingdom)</p><p>NIST (United States of America)</p><p>NMi -VSL (The Netherlands)</p><p>PTB (Germany)</p>

    The majority of participants applied isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) using thermal ionization MS (TIMS), sector field or quadrupole inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) as the analytical technique. IAEA reported a combined result of AAS and ICP-OES for the Ca amount content in the serum. The Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) was agreed upon during the IAWG meeting in October 2003 at EMPA/St-Gallen as the weighted mean of the reported participants' results. Accordingly the equivalence statements were calculated.</p><p>Main text.
