abstract:
- content: "<p>CCQM-P39 was an activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG)
    of \nCCQM and was organised by the Institute for Reference Materials and \nMeasurements
    (IRMM, Geel, Belgium) of the European Commission (EC). In \nCCQM-P39 the amount
    contents of As, Hg, Pb, Se and methylmercury (CH<sub>3</sub>Hg) in \ntuna fish
    muscle were the measurands under investigation. Besides the \nNational Metrology
    Institutes (NMIs) who are IAWG members, non-IAWG \nmembers, expert laboratories
    for mercury and methylmercury measurements, \nwere also invited to participate
    in this pilot study. Finally, results were \nreported by 13 NMIs and 8 expert
    laboratories.</p><p>The results of the IAWG members for arsenic and selenium fall
    within a \nrange of ±10% with respect to the mixture model median (MM-median).
    For \nlead, the spread was within 2% and for mercury within 4% deviation from
    the \nMM-median. Also, for methlymercury the majority of the participating NMIs
    \nreported results within 4% deviation from the MM-median. Including the \nreported
    results from the invited expert laboratories, the spread of \nresults increased
    for arsenic, lead, selenium and methlymercury up to 20%–40%. \nExcept for mercury,
    for this analyte the spread of all the reported \nresults of the IAWG members
    and the invited expert laboratories was within \n4%.</p><p>The methods applied
    were isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) using \nsector field or quadrupole
    inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \n(ICP-MS), external calibration
    using time-of-flight MS, atomic absorption \nspectrometry (AAS) or atomic fluorescence
    spectrometry (AFS). Instrumental \nneutron activation analysis (INAA) and k<sub>0</sub>-neutron
    activation analysis \n(k<sub>0</sub>-NAA) were also used as analytical techniques.
    Each of the five analytes \nunder investigation was measured with at least three
    of these analytical techniques.</p><p>IAEA reported two results for arsenic, lead
    and selenium. They were measured \nwith ICP-MS and AAS, respectively.</p><p>This
    report presents the participants' results in CCQM-P39 for all analytes \nunder
    investigation. In Annex 1, the results with the MM-median are \npresented and
    sorted according to analytical technique applied. In Annex 2, \nthe different
    approaches for methlymercury measurements are discussed in \nmore detail. In Annex
    3, the questionnaire data are presented. Annex 4 \ncompiles all the CCQM-P39 information
    documents.</p><p>At the CCQM meeting in April 2004, it was decided to proceed
    this study to \na key comparison and a pilot study for the same analytes in a
    salmon \nmaterial, CCQM-K43 and CCQM-P39.1.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCQM Working Group on Inorganic Analysis,
    according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
