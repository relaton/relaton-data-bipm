    <p>A supplementary comparison (SADC.AUV.V-S1) was organized to compare measurements of sinusoidal linear accelerations in the frequency range from 10 Hz to 10 kHz. In this bilateral comparison between the CSIR National Metrology Laboratory (CSIR–NML), South Africa and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany both NMIs applied laser interferometry in compliance with method 3 of the international standard ISO 16063-11:1999.</p><p>The complex charge sensitivity (magnitude and phase) of two different transfer standards (single-ended accelerometers) was measured at 37 frequencies. The results of the SADCMET.AUV.V-S1 are a set of comparison values and their uncertainties, and degrees of equivalence between these and between the two laboratories. From this complete set of results, six matrices of equivalence per accelerometer were selected and are demonstrated graphically.</p><p>The deviations between the PTB and NML results were smaller than 0.6° and 2° for the phase shift measurements for the Endevco and Brüel &amp; Kjær accelerometers respectively (37 measurement points each).</p><p>Main text.
