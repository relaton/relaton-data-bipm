    <p>During 1996 and 1997, eight national metrology institutes (NMI) took part in a vibration accelerometer comparison, identifier  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/final_reports/AUV/V-K1/APMP.AUV.V-K1.pdf">APMP.AUV.V-K1</ext-link>. Two NMIs ultimately withdrew from the comparison and the results of the remaining six NMIs have been approved by the CCAUV. Four NMIs subsequently took part in the 2001 CIPM key comparison for the same quantity, identifier CCAUV.V-K1. The results of these four CIPM participants have been used to link the results of the remaining two NMIs to the results in the CIPM key comparison using the reference frequency of 160 Hz. The CCAUV nominated the PTB to propose the methodology for the link and subsequently approved the linked results as presented in this report. The degrees of equivalence between each result and the key comparison reference value (KCRV), and between each NMI have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix and graph for six NMIs. As two results from the APMP can now be linked to the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/09001">published CCAUV.V-K1 comparison</ext-link>, the updated graph for the key comparison database is also given.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
