- content: "<p>This special issue on density was undertaken to provide readers with
    an overview of the present state of the density standards for solids, liquids
    and gases, as well as the technologies developed for measuring density. This issue
    also includes topics on the refractive index of gases and on techniques used for
    calibrating hydrometers so that almost all areas concerned with density standards
    are covered in four review articles and seven original articles, most of which
    describe current research being conducted at national metrology institutes (NMIs).
    A review article was invited from the Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum to highlight research
    on the magnetic suspension densimeters.</p><p>In metrology, the determinations
    of the volume of a weight and the density of air are of primary importance in
    establishing a mass standard because the effect of the buoyancy force of air acting
    on the weight must be known accurately to determine the mass of the weight. A
    density standard has therefore been developed at many NMIs with a close relation
    to the mass standard. Hydrostatic weighing is widely used to measure the volume
    of a solid. The most conventional hydrostatic weighing method uses water as a
    primary density standard for measuring the volume of a solid. A brief history
    of the determination of the density of water is therefore given in a review article,
    as well as a recommended value for the density of water with a specified isotopic
    abundance.</p><p>The most modern technique for hydrostatic weighing uses a solid
    density standard instead of water. For this purpose, optical interferometers for
    measuring the diameters of silicon spheres have been developed to convert the
    length standard into the volume standard with a small uncertainty. A review article
    is therefore dedicated to describing the state-of-the-art optical interferometers
    developed for silicon spheres. Relative combined standard uncertainties of several
    parts in 10<sup>8</sup> have been achieved today for measuring the volume and
    density of silicon spheres. These technologies are currently being used not only
    for establishing a solid density standard, but also for determining the Avogadro
    constant by the x-ray crystal density method, where the density, molar mass and
    lattice constant of a silicon crystal are measured based on the definition of
    the SI units. Considering that much of the present research on the Avogadro constant
    has been undertaken to replace the present definition of the kilogram with a new
    definition based on a number of atoms, it is satisfying to note that the most
    accurate density standard may contribute to a new definition of the kilogram.</p><p>Differential
    density measurements by hydrostatic weighing and by the pressure of flotation
    method developed for measuring the density differences between silicon crystals
    and solids are given in a review article and three original articles, where combined
    standard uncertainties of a few parts in 10<sup>8</sup> have been achieved in
    measuring relative density differences. These technologies are being used not
    only for the determination of the Avogadro constant, but also for evaluating defects
    in silicon crystals used in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>Another important
    liquid used in the density standard is mercury because the pressured standard
    determined from mercury column barometers, the molar gas constant determined from
    an acoustic resonator, and the Josephson constant determined from a mercury voltmeter
    are all dependent on the density of mercury. A review article is therefore dedicated
    to an overview of the history, recommended value and recent progress in the measurement
    of the density of mercury.</p><p>This special issue also features the technologies
    developed for measuring the thermodynamic properties of fluids. New instruments
    with a magnetic suspension balance have substantially improved the uncertainty
    in measuring the density of fluids at elevated pressures and temperatures. Two
    review articles and an original article are therefore dedicated to describing
    the history, principle and recent progress in magnetic suspension densimeters.
    When the diamagnetic properties of organic liquids are taken into account, an
    unprecedented uncertainty of a few parts in 10<sup>6</sup> can be achieved for
    density measurements at high pressures.</p><p>The papers collected in this special
    issue reflect the general trends in research on density standards. I hope that
    this special issue will stimulate new directions of research in the density standard,
    and also help to create more accurate, reliable and convenient methods for many
    applications. Thanks are addressed to all the authors who have contributed to
    this special issue on density, to the referees who have given their time, and
    also to the former editor Professor Martin and the present editor Dr~Williams
    for their support and useful suggestions in collecting the articles.</p>"
