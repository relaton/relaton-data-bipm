abstract:
- content: "<p>A review is given of how measurements of intensive thermodynamic properties
    of a gas, such as of refractivity and permittivity, can enable single-parameter
    monitoring of gas density. The last decade has seen the introduction of a number
    of new and improved optical and dielectric measurement techniques as well as significant
    advances in atomic structure calculations. Such advances may find application,
    for example, in the determination of primary gas mixtures and fundamental constants,
    buoyancy compensation in precision mass metrology and in dynamic pressure metrology.</p>"
