abstract:
- content: "<p>After a short review of the history of the flotation method, the flotation
    apparatus of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the measurement
    procedures are described in detail. A comprehensive description of the method
    used to achieve flotation by adjusting the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid
    is given, covering the heating by compression, surface effects and a calculation
    of the theoretical detection limit. Data evaluation of the single measurement
    is described as well as the least-squares fit for a group of samples using Lagrange
    multipliers to take constraints into account. Results of comparisons of density
    standards and samples measured to determine the molar volume of silicon and the
    Avogadro constant including the uncertainty budget and correlation coefficients
    are reported.</p>"
