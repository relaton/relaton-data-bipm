abstract:
- content: "<p>The method and devices used for the absolute measurement of the density
    of solids and liquids are reviewed. A density standard based on a single-crystal
    silicon sphere has recently been developed at national metrology institutes, where
    the mass of the 1 kg silicon sphere is compared with that of the mass standard
    traceable to the prototype of the kilogram, and the volume is determined directly
    by measuring its diameter using an optical interferometer, so that the unit of
    the density is directly traceable to the SI units of mass and length. The relative
    combined standard uncertainty for such a density determination has been reduced
    to 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>. Details of this solid density standard, and differential
    density measurements of solids and liquids by hydrostatic weighing, pressure of
    flotation, and magnetic suspension methods are described. Recent results on the
    absolute measurements of the density of water and mercury are briefly summarized.</p>"
