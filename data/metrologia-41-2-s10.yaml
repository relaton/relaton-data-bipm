abstract:
- content: "<p>To minimize the density correction of the transfer liquid in hydrostatic
    weighing, a new hydrostatic weighing machine with a single-step immersion pan
    was constructed. With this machine the volumes of two Zerodur® density-standard
    spheres (Z2, Z1), used as primary density standards at KRISS from 1992 to 2000,
    were measured against a silicon density-standard sphere that will be used as the
    new primary density standard. The relative measurement precision of the hydrostatic
    weighing was shown to be 7.7 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, and the expanded uncertainty of
    the volume measurement was found to be 2.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> for
    Z1 and Z2 with a confidence level of 95% and a coverage factor of 1.97, giving
    relative uncertainties of 6.7 × 10<sup>−7</sup> for Z2 and 7.9 × 10<sup>−7</sup>
    for Z1.</p>"
