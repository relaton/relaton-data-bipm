  content: "<p>This paper presents a new method to automatically align specific scale-marks
    for the calibration of hydrometers. A hydrometer calibration system adopting the
    new method consists of a vision system, a stepping motor, and software to control
    the system. The vision system is composed of a CCD camera and a frame grabber,
    and is used to acquire images. The stepping motor moves the camera, which is attached
    to the vessel containing a reference liquid, along the hydrometer. The operating
    program has two main functions: to process images from the camera to find the
    position of the horizontal plane and to control the stepping motor for the alignment
    of the horizontal plane with a particular scale-mark. Any system adopting this
    automatic alignment method is a convenient and precise means of calibrating a
    hydrometer. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by comparing
    the calibration results using the automatic alignment method with those obtained
    using the manual method.</p>"
