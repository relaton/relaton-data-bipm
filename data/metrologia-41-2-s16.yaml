  content: "<p>After a brief overview of the use of the density of mercury in metrological
    applications, the methods used for absolute and relative density measurements
    of mercury and the results obtained are reviewed. Influences exerted on the density
    by temperature, pressure, isotopic composition, and impurities are discussed,
    and the formulae recommended at present are listed. The problems arising from
    the use of the recommended substance properties for an unknown mercury sample
    are discussed.</p>"
