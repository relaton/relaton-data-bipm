  content: "<p>This paper comprehensively describes those types of densimeters that
    allow very accurate density measurements of fluid substances over large ranges
    of temperature and for high pressures and that also cover the entire density range
    from low gas densities up to high densities of compressed liquids. Densimeters
    meeting these requirements are based on special applications of hydrostatic balances
    in combination with magnetic suspension couplings. These densimeters can be subdivided
    into two-sinker densimeters, and single-sinker densimeters which allow <italic>p</italic>ρ<italic>T</italic>
    measurements with total uncertainties in density of about 0.01% to 0.02% (level
    of confidence 95%) depending on their individual design. Besides a discussion
    of the design of such densimeters, it is also shown which substances in which
    ranges of the fluid state have been investigated with these instruments. Using
    nitrogen as an example, the experimental results obtained with these densimeters
    are discussed and compared with the <italic>p</italic>ρ<italic>T</italic> data
    obtained with other types of densimeters. A description of the features of other
    types of densimeters is outside the scope of this paper, but they are briefly
    summarized at the beginning of this paper.</p>"
