abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper comprehensively describes those types of densimeters that
    allow very accurate density measurements of fluid substances over large ranges
    of temperature and for high pressures and that also cover the entire density range
    from low gas densities up to high densities of compressed liquids. Densimeters
    meeting these requirements are based on special applications of hydrostatic balances
    in combination with magnetic suspension couplings. These densimeters can be subdivided
    into two-sinker densimeters, and single-sinker densimeters which allow pρT measurements
    with total uncertainties in density of about 0.01% to 0.02% (level of confidence
    95%) depending on their individual design. Besides a discussion of the design
    of such densimeters, it is also shown which substances in which ranges of the
    fluid state have been investigated with these instruments. Using nitrogen as an
    example, the experimental results obtained with these densimeters are discussed
    and compared with the pρT data obtained with other types of densimeters. A description
    of the features of other types of densimeters is outside the scope of this paper,
    but they are briefly summarized at the beginning of this paper.</p>"
