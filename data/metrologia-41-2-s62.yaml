abstract:
- content: "<p>A new density comparison apparatus based on a pressure-of-flotation
    method (PFM) is presented. Density comparison measurements are performed for a
    new silicon crystal of the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) for the
    density standard and determination of the Avogadro constant. The density comparison
    measurement of silicon crystals by the new PFM apparatus has an estimated relative
    standard uncertainty of 4.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. Adjusted values of density are
    evaluated from the data of the PFM and absolute measurements using a least-squares
    algorithm, where correlations are taken into consideration.</p>"
