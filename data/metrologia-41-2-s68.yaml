  content: "<p>Air buoyancy causes a significant systematic effect in precision mass
    determination of 1 kg silicon spheres. In order to correct this effect accurately,
    mass measurement of the silicon sphere was conducted using buoyancy artefacts;
    additionally, in order to stabilize atmospheric conditions, we used a vacuum chamber
    in which a mass comparator had been installed. The silicon sphere was also weighed
    in vacuum to verify the air buoyancy correction. Mass differences measured in
    air and in vacuum showed good agreement with each other in spite of the desorption
    effect from weight surfaces. Furthermore, the result of weighing under vacuum
    conditions demonstrated better repeatability than that obtained in air.</p>"
