  content: "<p>For the precise measurement of the mass of a weight, buoyancy correction
    of air for the volume of a weight is necessary. Although hydrostatic weighing
    is the most accurate method currently used in determining volume, it is a relatively
    complicated process requiring the weight to be wetted in a reference fluid. Since
    more weights with high accuracy of mass are being used, a more sophisticated method
    of determining volume that satisfies uncertainty requirements has been demanded
    to improve the efficiency of calibration. In this paper, an acoustic volumeter
    is proposed for the measurement of the volume of weights. An acoustic volumeter
    can measure volume in atmosphere in a simple manner. Consequently, it is not necessary
    to consider the contamination and mass change due to the liquid used in the hydrostatic
    weighing method. In practical applications, a procedure for measuring the volume
    of weights ranging from 100 g to 10 kg using an acoustic volumeter is proposed.
    The volumes obtained using an acoustic volumeter were compared with those obtained
    by the hydrostatic weighing method, and the reliability of the measurement was
    evaluated with a relative uncertainty below the order of 1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.
    From the measurement results, it was shown that the use of an acoustic volumeter
    is effective for the measurement of the volume of weights.</p>"
