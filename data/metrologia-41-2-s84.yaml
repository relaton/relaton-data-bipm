abstract:
- content: "<p>A density measurement system with a magnetic suspension balance has
    been developed for accurate density measurements of reference liquids. In this
    system, the buoyancy force of a sample liquid acting on a sinker of silicon crystal
    is measured through a magnetic suspension coupling. For the accurate density measurements,
    the volume of the silicon sinker has been calibrated with a relative combined
    standard uncertainty of 1.4 × 10<sup>−6</sup> by the pressure-of-floatation method
    in a manner that is traceable to the International System of Units. The temperature
    of the sample liquid is controlled within a fluctuation of less than 1 mK. The
    effect of the magnetic property of the sample liquid on the density measurement
    has been examined. Theoretical calculation of the magnetic interaction in the
    densimeter has clarified that the diamagnetic property of n-tridecane, if not
    corrected, will result in a relative systematic error of 60 × 10<sup>−6</sup>
    in the density measurement. The densities of some candidates for the reference
    liquids, iso-octane, n-nonane, n-tridecane, water, 2,4-dichlorotoluene, 3,4-dichlorotoluene
    and bromobenzene have been measured. The relative combined standard uncertainty
    in the density measurement of bromobenzene has been estimated to be 6.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>
    at 20 °C under atmospheric pressure.</p>"
