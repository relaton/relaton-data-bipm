abstract:
- content: "<p>At NMi-VSL a humidity generator was built in the early 1990s. The generator
    is of the circulating single-temperature, single-pressure type. One pump recirculates
    air or nitrogen gas over two saturators, one of which can be selected, depending
    on the temperature range. Some components of the standard were found to operate
    not to the level that was anticipated during the design. The standard has been
    thoroughly refurbished. Experiments showed that the standard now operates from
    −60 °C to +70 °C, with much improved time constants and with lower uncertainties
    to within approximately 0.04 °C, depending on the temperature. Design considerations
    and requirements for this type of standard are given in the paper. The tests involved
    in evaluating the performance are discussed, and the results are presented with
    the resulting uncertainty budget.</p>"
