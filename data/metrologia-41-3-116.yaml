  content: "<p>Several studies highlight the need for appropriate statistical and
    probabilistic tools to analyse the data provided by the participants in an interlaboratory
    comparison. In some temperature comparisons, where the measurand is a physical
    state, independent realizations of the same physical state are acquired in each
    participating institute, which should be considered as belonging to a single super-population.
    This paper introduces the use of a probabilistic tool, a mixture of probability
    distributions, to represent the overall population in such a temperature comparison.
    This super-population is defined by combining the local populations in given proportions.
    The mixture density function identifies the total data variability, and the key
    comparison reference value has a natural definition as the expectation value of
    this probability density.</p>"
