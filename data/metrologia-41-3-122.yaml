  content: "<p>The method of constrained least squares is applied to the determination
    of laboratory bias and degrees of equivalence in the analysis of measurement comparisons.
    The analysis assumes a measurement model with unknown values for all travelling
    artefacts and laboratory biases. Least-squares fitting applied to this model yields
    an infinite set of solutions, all with the same inter-laboratory and inter-artefact
    differences. The application of a constraint, which can be interpreted as the
    definition of the key comparison reference value, then yields a single solution.
    Different types of constraint may be applied for known-value comparisons, for
    key comparisons without known values, and when linking regional metrology organization
    or supplementary comparisons to key comparisons. Once the laboratory biases are
    determined, the degrees of equivalence can be determined using the generic equations
    provided. The constrained-least-squares approach provides a single mathematical
    framework for the analysis of a wide range of comparisons including those with
    multiple artefacts of varying attributes, circulated amongst multiple overlapping
    comparison loops, laboratories that provide an arbitrary number of measurements
    of one or more of the artefacts, and spectral dependence of laboratory bias.</p>"
