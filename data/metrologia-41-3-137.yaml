abstract:
- content: "<p>The adsorption isotherms on SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si(100) surfaces were measured
    using a vacuum mass comparator. Samples with a surface area difference of 816.6 cm<sup>2</sup>
    were used for the measurement, and a substitution weighing method was adopted
    to reduce the uncertainty due to the drift and non-linearity of the indication
    of the mass comparator. We measured adsorption isotherms of water vapour on the
    SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si(100) surfaces outgassed at a temperature of 500 °C and found
    that dissociative adsorption caused an irreversible increase of 0.028 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>
    with an uncertainty of 0.004 µg cm<sup>−2</sup> (k = 1). We also found that the
    physical adsorption of water molecules on hydroxylated surfaces had a monolayer
    capacity of 0.004 µg cm<sup>−2</sup> with an uncertainty of 0.002 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>
    (k = 1). In addition, the adsorption isotherms for ethanol vapour and n-octane
    vapour, which were different from water vapour in adsorption properties, were
    measured and analysed.</p>"
