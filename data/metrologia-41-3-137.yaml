  content: "<p>The adsorption isotherms on SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si(100) surfaces were measured
    using a vacuum mass comparator. Samples with a surface area difference of 816.6 cm<sup>2</sup>
    were used for the measurement, and a substitution weighing method was adopted
    to reduce the uncertainty due to the drift and non-linearity of the indication
    of the mass comparator. We measured adsorption isotherms of water vapour on the
    SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si(100) surfaces outgassed at a temperature of 500 °C and found
    that dissociative adsorption caused an irreversible increase of 0.028 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>
    with an uncertainty of 0.004 µg cm<sup>−2</sup> (<italic>k</italic> = 1). We also
    found that the physical adsorption of water molecules on hydroxylated surfaces
    had a monolayer capacity of 0.004 µg cm<sup>−2</sup> with an uncertainty of 0.002 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>
    (<italic>k</italic> = 1). In addition, the adsorption isotherms for ethanol vapour
    and <italic>n</italic>-octane vapour, which were different from water vapour in
    adsorption properties, were measured and analysed.</p>"
