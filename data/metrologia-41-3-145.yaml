  content: "<p>It is known that the stability of time transfer with GPS common view
    in the low latitudes of Asia is worse than in Europe and the United States. The
    ionosphere fluctuates greatly within ±20° of the equator, which seems to have
    a large effect on time transfer stability. We compared the results of ionospheric
    corrections obtained using the Global Ionosphere Map (GIM) with those obtained
    from actual measurements from the ionosphere. The frequency stabilities of common-view
    results in the areas close to the equator were worse than those in higher latitudes
    when using the GIM correction, while the results compensated with the measured
    ionospheric delay were comparable with those in high latitude areas. We compared
    the GIM simulated variations with the actual variations in the ionosphere around
    the equator and found that the accuracies in the lower latitudes were not as good
    as those in the higher latitudes. This seems to degrade the time transfer stability
    throughout the lower latitudes of Asia.</p>"
