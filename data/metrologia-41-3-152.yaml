abstract:
- content: "<p>The absolute optical frequency of a 633 nm, I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized
    He–Ne laser system is measured with a femtosecond laser frequency comb. Results
    over a three-year period using chain- and comb-based measurements yield an operating
    frequency of f<sub>f</sub> = (473 612 353 602 850 ± 570) Hz for the INMS 3 laser
    stabilized to the f or a<sub>16</sub> component of the 11-5 R(127) transition
    in<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at the operating conditions specified for the realization
    of the recommended value of this radiation. The frequency of the NRC INMS 2 laser
    system has recently been measured with combs at NRC and BIPM and was shown to
    be reproducible to better than 600 Hz (1 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) after transport.
    These results indicate the high level of reproducibility attainable by such widely
    used optical frequency standards.</p>"
