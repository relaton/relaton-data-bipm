  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The absolute optical frequency of a 633 nm, I<sub>2</sub>-stabilized
    He–Ne laser system is measured with a femtosecond laser frequency comb. Results
    over a three-year period using chain- and comb-based measurements yield an operating
    frequency of <italic>f</italic><sub>f</sub> = (473 612 353 602 850 ± 570) Hz for
    the INMS 3 laser stabilized to the f or a<sub>16</sub> component of the 11-5 R(127)
    transition in <sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub> at the operating conditions specified
    for the realization of the recommended value of this radiation. The frequency
    of the NRC INMS 2 laser system has recently been measured with combs at NRC and
    BIPM and was shown to be reproducible to better than 600 Hz (1 × 10<sup>−12</sup>)
    after transport. These results indicate the high level of reproducibility attainable
    by such widely used optical frequency standards.</p>"
