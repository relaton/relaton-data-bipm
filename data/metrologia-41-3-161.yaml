  content: "<p>Several newly developed large area photoconductive (PC) mercury cadmium
    telluride (HgCdTe) radiometers have been tested for spatial and angular responsivity
    for the purpose of determining what mode of operation (or radiometric quantity)
    could provide the lowest measurement uncertainty. An infrared (IR) test facility
    has been developed for the characterization of long wavelength IR (LWIR) detectors
    and radiometers for spatial response uniformity in power measurement mode and
    angular responsivity in both power and irradiance measurement modes. We have measured
    34% to 53% spatial response non-uniformities and 1.5% to 10.5% changes in angular
    power reponsivity at different beam positions within the <italic>f</italic>/4
    field-of-view (FOV) of the PC HgCdTe radiometers. The lowest responsivity uncertainty
    is achieved when these non-uniform radiometers are operated in irradiance measurement
    mode, where the incident uniform field of radiation averages out the detector's
    non-uniformity related uncertainties. The angular response deviation from the
    cosine function within the 16° FOV of the radiometers dominates the uncertainty
    budget for irradiance responsivity measurements in the 3 µm to 20 µm sensitivity
    range of these working standard devices.</p>"
