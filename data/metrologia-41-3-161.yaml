abstract:
- content: "<p>Several newly developed large area photoconductive (PC) mercury cadmium
    telluride (HgCdTe) radiometers have been tested for spatial and angular responsivity
    for the purpose of determining what mode of operation (or radiometric quantity)
    could provide the lowest measurement uncertainty. An infrared (IR) test facility
    has been developed for the characterization of long wavelength IR (LWIR) detectors
    and radiometers for spatial response uniformity in power measurement mode and
    angular responsivity in both power and irradiance measurement modes. We have measured
    34% to 53% spatial response non-uniformities and 1.5% to 10.5% changes in angular
    power reponsivity at different beam positions within the f/4 field-of-view (FOV)
    of the PC HgCdTe radiometers. The lowest responsivity uncertainty is achieved
    when these non-uniform radiometers are operated in irradiance measurement mode,
    where the incident uniform field of radiation averages out the detector's non-uniformity
    related uncertainties. The angular response deviation from the cosine function
    within the 16° FOV of the radiometers dominates the uncertainty budget for irradiance
    responsivity measurements in the 3 µm to 20 µm sensitivity range of these working
    standard devices.</p>"
