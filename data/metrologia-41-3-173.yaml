  content: <p>This paper explores a recent suggestion to use a bivariate form of the
    Gaussian ‘error propagation law’ to propagate uncertainty in the measurement of
    complex-valued quantities (Ridler N M and Salter M J 2002 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
    xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/39/3/6"><italic>Metrologia</italic>
    <bold>39</bold> 295–302</ext-link>). Several alterative formulations of the law
    are discussed in which the contributions from individual input terms are more
    explicit. The calculation of complex-valued sensitivity coefficients is discussed
    and a matrix generalization of the notion of a ‘component of uncertainty’ in a
    measurement result is introduced. A form of a ‘chain rule’ is given for the propagation
    of uncertainty when several intermediate equations are involved.</p>
