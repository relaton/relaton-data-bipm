abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper explores a recent suggestion to use a bivariate form of
    the Gaussian ‘error propagation law’ to propagate uncertainty in the measurement
    of complex-valued quantities (Ridler N M and Salter M J 2002 Metrologia 39 295–302).
    Several alterative formulations of the law are discussed in which the contributions
    from individual input terms are more explicit. The calculation of complex-valued
    sensitivity coefficients is discussed and a matrix generalization of the notion
    of a ‘component of uncertainty’ in a measurement result is introduced. A form
    of a ‘chain rule’ is given for the propagation of uncertainty when several intermediate
    equations are involved.</p>"
