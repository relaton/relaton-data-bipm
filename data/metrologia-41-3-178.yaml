  content: "<p>The gravimetric method is the most popular method for preparing reference
    gas mixtures with high accuracy. We have designed and manufactured novel mass
    measurement equipment for gravimetric preparation of reference gas mixtures. This
    equipment consists of an electronic mass-comparator with a maximum capacity of
    15 kg and readability of 1 mg and an automatic cylinder exchanger. The structure
    of this equipment is simpler and the cost is much lower than a conventional mechanical
    knife-edge type large balance used for gravimetric preparation of primary gas
    mixtures in Japan. This cylinder exchanger can mount two cylinders alternatively
    on the weighing pan of the comparator. In this study, the performance of the equipment
    has been evaluated. At first, the linearity and repeatability of the mass measurement
    were evaluated using standard mass pieces. Then, binary gas mixtures of propane
    and nitrogen were prepared and compared with those prepared with the conventional
    knife-edge type balance. The comparison resulted in good consistency at the compatibility
    criterion described in ISO6143:2001.</p>"
