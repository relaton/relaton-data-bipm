abstract:
- content: "<p>The refractive index of helium at atmospheric pressure can be determined
    from ab initio calculations in combination with careful pressure and temperature
    measurements. Therefore, helium can serve as a theory-based standard of refractive
    index; it might be used as a medium of known refractive index for high-accuracy
    interferometric length measurements or it can be used to characterize and correct
    errors in a gas refractometer. We have used helium to correct for pressure-induced
    distortions of two refractometers built by us, where both refractometers basically
    consist of a laser locked to the transmission maximum of a simple Fabryâ€“Perot
    cavity. As a proof-of-principle of the helium-correction technique, we have used
    our device to measure the molar refractivity of nitrogen and we find reasonable
    agreement with previous measurements. When our two refractometers simultaneously
    measure the refractive index of a common nitrogen sample, we find that the two
    systems agree with each other within a few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>"
