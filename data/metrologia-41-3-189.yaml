  content: "<p>The refractive index of helium at atmospheric pressure can be determined
    from <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations in combination with careful pressure
    and temperature measurements. Therefore, helium can serve as a theory-based standard
    of refractive index; it might be used as a medium of known refractive index for
    high-accuracy interferometric length measurements or it can be used to characterize
    and correct errors in a gas refractometer. We have used helium to correct for
    pressure-induced distortions of two refractometers built by us, where both refractometers
    basically consist of a laser locked to the transmission maximum of a simple Fabryâ€“Perot
    cavity. As a proof-of-principle of the helium-correction technique, we have used
    our device to measure the molar refractivity of nitrogen and we find reasonable
    agreement with previous measurements. When our two refractometers simultaneously
    measure the refractive index of a common nitrogen sample, we find that the two
    systems agree with each other within a few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>"
