abstract:
- content: "<p>Twelve platinum resistance thermometers (PRTs) were repeatedly calibrated
    between the triple point of water and the silver point. During each calibration
    their resistance was also determined at the Cu–Ag eutectic point. The temperatures
    indicated by the PRTs were within ±1 mK, except for one that differed by 4 mK
    from the average, 779.6360 °C, of the other eleven.</p><p>Four of these PRTs had
    a lower W (Ag) value than acceptable by the ITS-90, including the one that differed
    by 4 mK. Thus, within this set of PRTs all the ‘acceptable’ ones and three out
    of four ‘unacceptable’ ones indicated a unique temperature within 1 mK halfway
    between the aluminium and the silver points.</p>"
