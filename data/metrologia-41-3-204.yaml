abstract:
- content: "<p>Previously verified models of windowless silicon photodiodes can be
    used to estimate their spectral response by purely relative measurements. The
    spectral reflectance is found from a single measurement at one wavelength to estimate
    the oxide thickness, from which the full spectral reflectance is calculated. The
    internal quantum deficiency of the silicon detector is found by fitting a physical
    model to a purely relative measurement to a spectrally invariant detector. The
    detector model ensures correct scaling of the responsivity. This method contributes
    to simplification of the traceability and promises a very cost efficient realization
    of an accurate independent spectral response scale. We have measured the responsivity
    of a silicon trap detector with this method. An uncertainty less than 0.20% was
    observed with 95% confidence in the spectral range from 455 nm to 760 nm. The
    uncertainty was calculated from the observed variance in the relative spectral
    response measurement. The uncertainty was limited by the signal to noise ratio
    (SNR) in the measurements of the relative spectral response of the silicon trap
    detectors.</p>"
