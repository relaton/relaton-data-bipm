abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A practical guide to experimental conditions such as statistical variation
    of signal intensity on quantitative solution state nuclear magnetic resonanace
    (NMR) analysis is discussed and presented. Statistical analysis showed that there
    is a relationship between a targeted precision and practical pulse intervals.
    The bandwidth of the audio filter needs to be set so that all the signals of interest
    fall into 80% of the centre part of the filter. When fulfilling these conditions,
    the relative standard deviation (RSD) of a signal area in repeated experiments
    can be estimated by determining the signal-to-noise ratio (SN) of a single spectrum.
    When the SN reached 1000, the RSD became constant with increasing SN. With such
    a condition, accuracy better than 1% should be obtained with quantitative NMR.</p>"
