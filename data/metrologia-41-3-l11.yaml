abstract:
- content: "<p>The approach to evaluation of measurement uncertainty for influences
    impacting the evaluation of the fringe fraction using digital methods is presented.
    We also included uncertainty considerations regarding correction for platen flexing
    in long gauge block calibrations, where the phase of the platen reference surface
    is extrapolated to the side edge of the gauge block. Contributions to the uncertainty
    budget for a refractometer cell in the interferometer set-up for long gauge block
    calibration are outlined, including the effect of correlation between uncertainties
    in the wavefront phase used in refractivity and central length measurements.</p>"
