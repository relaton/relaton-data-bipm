abstract:
- content: "<p>There is potential for confusion between the term ‘coverage interval’,
    which is developing a common usage in metrology, and the term ‘statistical coverage
    interval’, as defined in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.
    The meaning of a ‘statistical coverage interval’ is explained further, and possible
    courses of action are suggested.</p>"
