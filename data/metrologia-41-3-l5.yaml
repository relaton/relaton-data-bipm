  content: "<p>There is potential for confusion between the term ‘coverage interval’,
    which is developing a common usage in metrology, and the term ‘statistical coverage
    interval’, as defined in the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
    Measurement</italic>. The meaning of a ‘statistical coverage interval’ is explained
    further, and possible courses of action are suggested.</p>"
