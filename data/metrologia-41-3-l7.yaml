abstract:
- content: "<p>The usual method adopted for multipoint calibration of glass hydrometers
    is based on the measurement of the buoyancy by hydrostatic weighing when the hydrometer
    is plunged in a reference liquid up to the scale mark to be calibrated.</p><p>An
    image processing approach is proposed by the authors to align the relevant scale
    mark with the reference liquid surface level. The method uses image analysis with
    a data processing technique and takes into account the perspective error. For
    this purpose a CCD camera with a pixel matrix of 604H × 576V and a lens of 16 mm
    focal length were used.</p><p>High accuracy in the hydrometer reading was obtained
    as the resulting reading uncertainty was lower than 0.02 mm, about a fifth of
    the usual figure with the visual reading made by an operator.</p>"
