abstract:
- content: "<p>Results of International Key Comparisons of National Measurement Standards
    provide the technical basis for the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) formulated
    by Le Comit√© International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM). With many key comparisons
    already completed and a number of new key comparison experiments currently under
    way, we now have a better understanding of the statistical issues that need to
    be addressed for successfully analysing data from key comparisons and making proper
    interpretations of the results. There is clearly a need for a systematic approach
    to statistical analyses of key comparison data that can be implemented routinely
    by all participating laboratories.</p><p>The determination of a key comparison
    reference value (KCRV) and its associated uncertainty and the degrees of equivalence
    are the central tasks in the evaluation of key comparison data. A satisfactory
    definition of a KCRV, however, is based on the assumption that all laboratories
    are estimating the same unknown quantity of the common circulating artefact, that
    is, the results from the different laboratories are mutually consistent. In this
    paper, we compare a number of statistical procedures for testing the consistency
    assumption.</p>"
