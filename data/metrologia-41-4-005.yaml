abstract:
- content: "<p>A new primary standard for generation of vacuum pressures between 9
    × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa and 10<sup>3</sup> Pa has been completed at the Ulusal Metroloji
    Enstitüsü (UME). It is based on the static expansion method, whereby the range
    is extended to lower pressures by multiple expansions. The apparatus consists
    of six vessels that provide a pressure reduction by a factor of about 10<sup>−6</sup>
    in the main calibration vessel after a three-step expansion. Seventeen platinum
    resistance thermometers are mounted on the vessels to determine the correction
    due to temperature effects. The whole apparatus is built using the UHV technique
    and can be baked up to 400 °C. The expanded (k = 2) relative uncertainties of
    pressures, generated by this new standard, range from 2.1 × 10<sup>−3</sup> at
    9 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa to 9.5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> at 10<sup>3</sup> Pa.</p>"
