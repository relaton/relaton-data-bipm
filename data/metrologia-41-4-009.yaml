abstract:
- content: "<p>A primary system based on the so-called static expansion of gases has
    been made available at IMGC-CNR for gauge calibration in the range 0.1 Pa to 1000 Pa.</p><p>As
    is known, in such systems the generated pressure is calculated by application
    of the ideal gas law and is a function of the inlet pressure, the temperatures
    of the various volumes and their ratios.</p><p>The uncertainty evaluation of the
    pressure measured with such system is the main subject of this paper.</p><p>At
    present, the system is operated with three volumes (≈0.01 litre, ≈0.5 litre and
    ≈50 litre) and two expansion ratios ( R<sub>4</sub> ≅ 4761 and  R<sub>3</sub>
    ≅ 95) determined by application of the multiple expansion method through pressure
    measurements performed with the best transfer gauges available at IMGC-CNR. The
    characteristics of such transfer gauges are discussed with respect to two different
    conditions of use: that is, for determination of the expansion ratio,  R<sub>
    j</sub>, and for measurements of the inlet pressure.</p><p>The combined expanded
    uncertainty of the generated pressure ( p<sub> xi</sub>) is then given by\n  \nand</p><p>Considerations
    on participation in comparisons are also presented.</p>"
