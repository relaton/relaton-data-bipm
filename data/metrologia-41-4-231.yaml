abstract:
- content: "<p>A statistical analysis for key comparisons with linear trends is proposed.
    The approach has the advantage that it is consistent with the no-trend cases.
    The uncertainties for the key comparison reference value, which is time dependent
    in this case, and the degrees of equivalence are also provided. As an example,
    the approach is applied to key comparison CCEM-K2.</p>"
