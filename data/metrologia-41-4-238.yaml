  content: "<p>Measurement of the (220) Bragg-plane spacing of Si using combined x-ray
    and optical interferometry with an uncertainty lower than 10<sup>−8</sup> requires
    the study of influence factors not considered in the past. In this paper the Bragg-plane
    spacing definition itself is re-examined and the influence of a constant strain
    gradient is studied by means of Takagi's equations. Their analytical and numerical
    solutions indicate that, contrary to our previous assumption, the period of the
    travelling fringes is affected by the Si atom spacing at the analyser entrance
    surface.</p>"
