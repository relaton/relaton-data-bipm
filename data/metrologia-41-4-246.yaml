  content: "<p>The uncertainty of a primary spectral irradiance scale based on filter
    radiometers (FRs) is studied by analysing the propagation of uncertainties and
    covariances through a spectral interpolation process, when a modified Planck's
    radiation law is fitted to the measurement data. The advantage of performing the
    uncertainty analysis in optimizing the selection of the FR wavelengths is demonstrated.
    We also estimate the effect that correlations in the FR signals have on the uncertainty
    of the fitted spectral irradiance values. In the case of correlated input data,
    the results of the uncertainty propagation are found to be within two practical
    limits: uncertainty values in the FR data and the values obtained by uncertainty
    propagation with uncorrelated FR signals.</p>"
