abstract:
- content: "<p>In cooperation with the Time and Frequency Group of the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology, the Communications Research Laboratory has developed
    an optically pumped primary frequency standard (PFS) which is named CRL-O1. The
    accuracy of CRL-O1 has been evaluated and reports have been sent to the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures. The results of the evaluations have been published
    in Circular T. We estimate the biases of the frequency shifts and the so-called
    type A and type B uncertainties. The combination of type A and type B uncertainties
    is about 7 × 10<sup>−15</sup>. The evaluated frequency of CRL-O1 is in good agreement
    with that of other PFSs.</p>"
