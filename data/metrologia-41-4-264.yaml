    <p>In this work, a new experimental method, based on non-invasive infrared thermograph techniques, has been developed to visualize and quantify the spatial temperature distribution of the convective air currents generated by a heated body.</p>
    <p>Starting from that distribution of temperature and using some theoretical models, the corresponding velocity distribution of the air currents and drag forces were evaluated. Once the drag forces were obtained, their values were compared with the values of mass variations taken from the balance, proving the relationship between the inverse of the drag forces and the values of the variation of mass.</p>
