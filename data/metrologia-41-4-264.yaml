abstract:
- content: "<p>In this work, a new experimental method, based on non-invasive infrared
    thermograph techniques, has been developed to visualize and quantify the spatial
    temperature distribution of the convective air currents generated by a heated
    body.</p><p>Starting from that distribution of temperature and using some theoretical
    models, the corresponding velocity distribution of the air currents and drag forces
    were evaluated. Once the drag forces were obtained, their values were compared
    with the values of mass variations taken from the balance, proving the relationship
    between the inverse of the drag forces and the values of the variation of mass.</p>"
