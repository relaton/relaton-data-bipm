  content: "<p>We present a method to analyse international measurement comparisons,
    including linking two or more comparisons. This method, which is based on linear
    generalized least-squares estimation, directly gives the degrees of equivalence
    required by the Mutual Recognition Arrangement, both relative to the key comparison
    reference value (KCRV) and between pairs of participating laboratories. The key
    features of the method are its ability to accommodate multiple travelling standards
    (including instabilities in the standards), multiple measurements by participating
    laboratories, multiple comparison loops, and known correlations between measurements
    (both intra- and interlaboratory). The method can be applied with or without a
    KCRV (but does not give a value for the KCRV). An analysis of the linked comparisons
    APMP.M.M-Kl and CCM.M-Kl is presented to illustrate the method. While best suited
    to comparisons with single-valued travelling standards, the method can be applied
    to most other comparison types.</p>"
