    <p>A primary system based on the so-called static expansion of gases has been made available at IMGC-CNR for gauge calibration in the range 0.1 Pa to 1000 Pa.</p>
    <p>As is known, in such systems the generated pressure is calculated by application of the ideal gas law and is a function of the inlet pressure, the temperatures of the various volumes and their ratios.</p>
    <p>The uncertainty evaluation of the pressure measured with such system is the main subject of this paper.</p>
    <p>At present, the system is operated with three volumes (≈0.01 litre, ≈0.5 litre and ≈50 litre) and two expansion ratios (<italic>R</italic><sub>4</sub> ≅ 4761 and <italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> ≅ 95) determined by application of the multiple expansion method through pressure measurements performed with the best transfer gauges available at IMGC-CNR. The characteristics of such transfer gauges are discussed with respect to two different conditions of use: that is, for determination of the expansion ratio, <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, and for measurements of the inlet pressure.</p>
    <p>The combined expanded uncertainty of the generated pressure (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>xi</italic></sub>) is then given by

    and

    <p>Considerations on participation in comparisons are also presented.</p>
