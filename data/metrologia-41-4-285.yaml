abstract:
- content: "<p>New quantum Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) with nominal values
    in the range from R<sub>K</sub>/200 to 50R<sub>K</sub> (i = 2 plateau) have been
    developed (R<sub>K</sub> is the von Klitzing constant). The design of the QHARS
    based on the connection in parallel of Hall bars is made suitable for use in both
    magnetic field directions. Measurements performed with currents up to 4 mA at
    1.3 K show that R<sub>K</sub>/200 (∼129 Ω) and 16R<sub>K</sub>/4130 (∼100 Ω) resistance
    standards have Hall resistances which agree with their nominal values within 5
    parts in 10<sup>9</sup> (1σ). While increasing the temperature, the Hall resistance
    varies linearly with the longitudinal resistance. Because the sign of this deviation
    depends on the magnetic field direction, the average of the Hall resistance values
    measured for both magnetic field directions remains constant within 5 parts in
    10<sup>9</sup> up to 4.2 K. Owing to their large working current, these QHARS
    have allowed an accurate calibration of a 100 Ω wire resistor using a commercial
    resistance bridge. An R<sub>K</sub>/20 (∼1290 Ω) resistance standard made of ten
    Hall bars placed in parallel by quadruple connections has also been studied. It
    is found that the resistances measured by using three different voltage terminal
    pairs agree within 5 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> in relative value.</p>"
