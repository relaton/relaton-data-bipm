  content: "<p>New quantum Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) with nominal values
    in the range from <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>/200 to 50<italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>
    (<italic>i</italic> = 2 plateau) have been developed (<italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>
    is the von Klitzing constant). The design of the QHARS based on the connection
    in parallel of Hall bars is made suitable for use in both magnetic field directions.
    Measurements performed with currents up to 4 mA at 1.3 K show that <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>/200
    (∼129 Ω) and 16<italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>/4130 (∼100 Ω) resistance standards
    have Hall resistances which agree with their nominal values within 5 parts in
    10<sup>9</sup> (1σ). While increasing the temperature, the Hall resistance varies
    linearly with the longitudinal resistance. Because the sign of this deviation
    depends on the magnetic field direction, the average of the Hall resistance values
    measured for both magnetic field directions remains constant within 5 parts in
    10<sup>9</sup> up to 4.2 K. Owing to their large working current, these QHARS
    have allowed an accurate calibration of a 100 Ω wire resistor using a commercial
    resistance bridge. An <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>/20 (∼1290 Ω) resistance standard
    made of ten Hall bars placed in parallel by quadruple connections has also been
    studied. It is found that the resistances measured by using three different voltage
    terminal pairs agree within 5 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> in relative value.</p>"
