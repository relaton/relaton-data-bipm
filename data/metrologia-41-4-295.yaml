abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe a quasi-spherical, noble-gas-filled cavity designed to
    determine the thermodynamic temperature of the gas from measurements of the frequencies
    and the half-widths of microwave and acoustic resonances in the cavity. The quasi-spherical
    shape retains the advantages of spherical acoustic resonators (non-degenerate,
    radially symmetric acoustic modes, negligible viscous damping at the boundary)
    while simplifying the determination of the cavity's thermal expansion using microwave
    resonances. As a specific example, we consider a cavity bounded by four quadrants
    of a perfect sphere of radius a connected to each other by narrow cylindrical
    sections of thickness 2ϵ<sub>1</sub>a and 2ϵ<sub>2</sub>a, where ϵ<sub>1</sub>
    and ϵ<sub>2</sub> are of the order of 10<sup>−3</sup>. The cylindrical sections
    split the degenerate microwave triplets (TM11, TE11, TM12, etc) into three easily
    resolved components with predictable orientations. Preliminary measurements show
    that two judiciously located microwave probes excite and detect all three components
    of each microwave triplet with approximately equal amplitudes. We discuss the
    placement of acoustic transducers and the dimensions of ducts that admit gas from
    a manifold into the cavity.</p><p>Corrections were made to this article on 14

    The corrections are in the first two paragraphs of section 5.2 and in table 6.</p>"
