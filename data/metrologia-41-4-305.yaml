abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents a new radiation pyrometry, multi-band pyrometry,
    obtained by increasing the narrow wavelength bandwidth of multi-wavelength pyrometry.
    The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the necessity for and the merit of multi-band
    pyrometry, compared with the traditional multi-wavelength pyrometry. Here, we
    propose theoretical optimization criteria, based on the temperature discrimination
    resolution, to analyse the characteristics of multi-band pyrometry. The simulation
    results indicate that the wavelength bandwidth of multi-band pyrometry does affect
    the temperature discrimination resolution, and the choice of the bandwidth range
    will have a significant influence on the performance of the radiation pyrometer.
    Finally, we conclude that the traditional multi-wavelength pyrometry with ‘pure’
    wavelengths is sometimes not the optimum method for measurements of true surface
    temperatures. However, multi-band pyrometry with the appropriate bandwidth range
    may be the optimum method to achieve optimum measurements.</p>"
