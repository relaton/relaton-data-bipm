abstract:
- content: "<p>A mass comparator for 1 kg weights has been designed and built at the
    BIPM based on our experience with a prototype flexure-strip balance named FB-1.
    The flexure-strip balance FB-2 is fully automated and mainly used for research.
    It consistently achieves a repeatability of weighings in air or in vacuum of 1 kg
    artefacts at least ten times better than that obtainable with the best knife-edge
    balances. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and capabilities of
    the FB-2, drawing on theoretical studies already published. Finally, results obtained
    with the FB-2 are given to illustrate its metrological possibilities.</p>"
