  content: "<p>This work is a follow-up to a previous study that was aimed at reducing
    the uncertainty of the air density correction used to correct mass comparisons
    for the effects of air buoyancy. To clarify the difference observed previously
    in moist air between two absolute methods (CIPM-81/91 formula and air buoyancy
    artefacts determination), additional measurements were carried out in moist air,
    dry nitrogen and vacuum. The results obtained by the two methods for nitrogen
    density were in good agreement while the discrepancy was confirmed for the moist
    air density. A comparison of a 1 kg stainless steel mass against a 1 kg Pt/Ir
    mass standard was carried out to compare the accuracy of these two methods. The
    results of this comparison made in moist air, dry nitrogen and vacuum by using
    buoyancy artefacts gave an agreement within 1 µg. Our particular results confirmed
    the good accuracy of the air buoyancy artefacts method and reinforced the hypotheses
    that the accuracy of the air density using the CIPM formula is limited by the
    estimation of its composition.</p>"
