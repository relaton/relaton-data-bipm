abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this work is to study the effect of water vapour sorption
    on mass standards by means of two methods: (a) a global and direct gravimetric
    method determining the water vapour deposit on the total surface area of mass
    standards; (b) an optical and indirect ellipsometric method permitting the evaluation
    of the adsorbed water thickness on the localized surface of mass standards.</p><p>The
    coefficient of water vapour adsorption in moist air and the amount of water desorption
    from air to vacuum were determined on the surfaces of mass standards. Measurements
    were achieved by both methods using the same samples of Pt/Ir, stainless steel
    and silicon. Results obtained on stainless steel showed a good agreement between
    the two methods. For the Pt/Ir and the silicon samples, the sorption effect evaluated
    by the gravimetric method was about twice that inferred from ellipsometry.</p>"
