abstract:
- content: "<p>An international Advisory Group on Uncertainties has published guidelines
    for the statistical analysis of a simple key comparison carried out by the Consultative
    Committees of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) where
    a travelling standard of a stable value is circulated among the participants.
    We discuss several concerns regarding these guidelines. Then, we describe a statistical
    model based on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement to establish
    the key comparison reference value, the degrees of equivalence, and their associated
    standard uncertainties on the basis of the data submitted by the participants.
    The proposed statistical model applies to all those CIPM key comparisons where
    the submitted results are mutually comparable and appropriate for determining
    the key comparison reference value and the submitted uncertainties are sufficiently
    reliable.</p>"
