  content: "<p>An international Advisory Group on Uncertainties has published guidelines
    for the statistical analysis of a simple key comparison carried out by the Consultative
    Committees of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) where
    a travelling standard of a stable value is circulated among the participants.
    We discuss several concerns regarding these guidelines. Then, we describe a statistical
    model based on the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>
    to establish the key comparison reference value, the degrees of equivalence, and
    their associated standard uncertainties on the basis of the data submitted by
    the participants. The proposed statistical model applies to all those CIPM key
    comparisons where the submitted results are mutually comparable and appropriate
    for determining the key comparison reference value and the submitted uncertainties
    are sufficiently reliable.</p>"
