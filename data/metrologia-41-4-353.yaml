  content: "<p>We have studied two kinds of reference detectors to be used for calibration
    of fibre optic power meters. The first type consists of an InGaAs photodiode mounted
    directly on an adapter using a standard FC connector. In the second type, a similar
    photodiode is fitted into a 5 cm diameter integrating sphere. The plain photodiodes
    are used for low power levels and the sphere detector for high power levels because
    of the low throughput (∼0.7%) of the sphere. The detectors, with their FC connectors
    removed, are calibrated using collimated laser beams, using as the reference a
    spectrally flat pyroelectric radiometer traceable to a cryogenic absolute radiometer.
    The spatial non-uniformities of the plain photodiodes are of the order of 0.3%
    throughout the active area of 5 mm diameter. The angular responsivity varies less
    than ±0.1% within the angle of ±8°, which covers 99% of the radiation emitted
    from the fibre end. The angular non-uniformity of the sphere detector is less
    than 0.1%. The results indicate that a plain photodiode can be used as a reference
    detector of fibre optic power. The calibration uncertainty at HUT is presently
    of the order of 1% (<italic>k</italic> = 2).</p>"
