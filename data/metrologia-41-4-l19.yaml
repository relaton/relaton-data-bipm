  content: "<p>In a ballistic gravimeter, when a test body rotates during free fall
    an optical path error results, unless the centre of mass (COM) and the optical
    centre of the corner cube are exactly co-located. The error associated with the
    rotation needs to be held to 1 µGal (1 µGal = 10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>)
    or less, so as to not compromise the accuracy of today's absolute gravimeters.
    This error is systematic, difficult to monitor and can be decreased in only two
    ways: (1) by reducing the rotation rate of the falling object and/or (2) by minimizing
    the distance between the COM of the dropping object and the optical centre of
    the corner cube embedded in it. We report here on a new direct and extremely sensitive
    method for minimizing the distance between the COM and the optical centre.</p>"
