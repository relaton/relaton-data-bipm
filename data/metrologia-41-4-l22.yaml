abstract:
- content: "<p>In the context of experimental information shortage, uncertainty evaluation
    of a directly measured quantity involves obtaining its standard uncertainty as
    the standard deviation of an assigned probability density function (pdf) that
    is assumed to apply. In this article, we present a criterion to select the appropriate
    pdf associated with the estimate of a quantity by seeking that pdf which is the
    most probable among those which agree with the available information. As examples,
    we apply this criterion to assign the proper pdf to a measurand assuming that
    we know just its estimate, or both its estimate and its standard uncertainty.
    Our results agree with those obtained by applying the principle of maximum entropy
    to both situations.</p>"
