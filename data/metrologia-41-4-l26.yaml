abstract:
- content: "<p>In recent years the Comité International des Poids et Mesures has assigned
    the unit one to all dimensionless quantities and to some countable quantities.
    This article examines the reasons for that decision and questions their logical
    basis. It draws attention to some of its undesirable consequences.</p>"
