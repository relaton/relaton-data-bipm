  content: "<p>In recent years the Comité International des Poids et Mesures has assigned
    the unit <italic>one</italic> to all dimensionless quantities and to some countable
    quantities. This article examines the reasons for that decision and questions
    their logical basis. It draws attention to some of its undesirable consequences.</p>"
