- content: "<p>This special issue on the physics and metrology of electrical charge
    attempts to \nprovide the interested reader with an overview of the ways in which
    this fundamental \nproperty of matter has been studied and measured, both historically
    and in present \ntimes.  Few topics in introductory physics and electrical engineering
    courses receive \nas much attention as does the nature and behaviour of electrical
    charge, and \nexperimental tests of Coulomb's law are a staple of such curricula.
    \ The manipulation \nof electrical charge, even down to the level of single electrons,
    constitutes the \ncurrency of electrical metrology, while the effects of parasitic
    forces arising from \nspurious charges are the bane of virtually all who work
    in the realm of high precision \nexperimentation.  Moreover, basic questions about
    the equality, discreteness and \npossible fractional sizes of elementary charges
    lie at the foundation of modern physics \non the one hand, while the control of
    charge carriers within electrical and electronic \ndevices forms the core of essentially
    all of modern technology, on the other.</p><p>The theme of the special issue is
    thus one of reviewing the scientific \nfoundations of charge as a property of
    matter and as a tool for testing fundamental \nphysical laws.  The historical
    development of both aspects of this theme during the \nlast two centuries has
    helped form the basis for modern electrical metrology.  \nTherefore, it seemed
    timely to reassess the field with an eye towards future \ndevelopments, especially
    since we find ourselves at the 250th anniversary of the \nperiod during which
    Benjamin Franklin carried out some of the first quantitative \nelectrical measurements,
    in his colonial laboratory in Pennsylvania.</p><p>To that end, the special issue
    contains articles on several aspects of electrical \ncharge that have been the
    focus of intense study during the past several years.  \nCoulomb's law is of course
    central to any discussions in electrical science, and two of \nthe articles provide
    detailed descriptions of the experimental foundations for and the \ntheoretical
    implications of it.  The modern interpretation of possible deviations from \nexact
    inverse-square behaviour in Coulomb's law invokes a non-zero rest mass for the
    \nphoton, and the limits on the sizes of such effects and the roles that they
    would play in \nphysical theories are addressed in those articles.  The other
    papers include a \ndiscussion of the state of knowledge regarding the electrical
    neutrality of bulk matter \nand proton/electron charge asymmetries, a description
    of a very high precision search \nfor fractional electrical charges, a comparative
    overview of the physical analogies \nbetween the electromagnetic and gravitational
    forces, and a succinct historical study of Coulomb \nhimself and the law and unit
    of charge which bear his name.</p><p>During the past year,  Metrologia has published
    two other topical issues on \nfundamental properties of matter: mass and density.
    \ The present special issue forms a \ncompanion document to them.  It has been
    the goal of this special issue to capture the \ncontemporary flavour of the work
    being done by physicists who seek to establish the \nexactness of the physical
    laws that serve as foundations for the further advancement \nof electrical metrology.
    \ Thanks are due to the several authors who took time to \nprepare these articles,
    the referees who reviewed and commented on them, to \nProfessor Peter Martin and
    Dr Jeffrey Williams, former and present Editors of \n Metrologia, respectively,
    and to Dr Terry Quinn, Director Emeritus of the BIPM, for \ntheir advice, assistance
    and central roles in bringing the special issue to completion.</p>"
