  content: "<p>In his famous experiment on the inverse square law of electrostatics,
    Coulomb neither defined electric charge nor gave reliable measurements of the
    forceâ€“distance relation. Yet the experiment has often been viewed as the basis
    of the fundamental law of electrostatics. This paper discusses Coulomb's life,
    showing the context within which he was working, how he arrived at the experiment,
    and the use he made of it. Physics in France in the late 18th century was undergoing
    a transformation from a science of holistic observation and explanations to one
    of universal laws and exact measurement. Coulomb was both a subject of, and an
    important contributor to, this change, and these two aspects are evident in his
    approach to the experiment and to the later uptake of his results. The reaction
    in the rest of Europe was initially less favourable, and the ultimate fame of
    Coulomb's experiment was dependent on the triumph of French mathematical physics
    in the 19th century.</p>"
