abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a brief history of physical analogies that begins at the time
    of Coulomb. Then it was universally believed that gravity, electricity and magnetism
    all obeyed Newton's inverse square law. The current era—dominated by quantum mechanics,
    general relativity, strings and inflationary cosmology—is clearly more complex.
    A new analogy may be helpful. Evidence is given that, in the non-relativistic
    limit, electricity is described by a Proca potential ϕ<sub>e</sub> satisfying
    the equation ∇<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sub>e</sub> − k<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>ϕ<sub>e</sub>
    = −ρ<sub>e</sub>/ϵ<sub>0</sub> and gravity by a Helmholtz potential ϕ<sub>m</sub>
    satisfying ∇<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sub>m</sub> + k<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>ϕ<sub>m</sub>
    = 4πGρ<sub>m</sub>. In both equations k<sub>0</sub> is a proposed universal constant,
    whose value is about 2 π(20/R<sub>0</sub>), where R<sub>0</sub> is the distance
    from the solar system to the centre of the Milky Way. Relativistic treatments
    are also given.</p>"
