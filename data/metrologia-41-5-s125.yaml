abstract:
- content: "<p>The equality of the charges of the electron and the proton, and the
    charge neutrality of the neutron are of great significance in the fundamental
    theory of particles. This equality suggests a deep symmetry between leptons and
    quarks that is not yet revealed in other experiments. The electrical neutrality
    of bulk matter is a direct result of this characteristic of the fundamental charges,
    with important consequences for precise tests of fundamental physical laws and
    for electrical metrology. The question is of interest also in cosmology. In this
    paper, we discuss the experimental evidence for the equality of the fundamental
    electrical charges, its implications and the possibility of improved experiments.</p>"
