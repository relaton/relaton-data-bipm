  content: "<p>Coulomb's Law is a fundamental principle describing the electric force
    between isolated charges, and represents the first quantitative law achieved in
    electromagnetism. The degree of confidence with which the law is experimentally
    known to hold was investigated after the law was put forth by Coulomb in 1785.
    The electrodynamics for massive particles suggests that a photon with a finite
    rest mass will cause a deviation from the inverse square law. So, modern interpretations
    of the possible deviation from Coulomb's inverse square law are usually associated
    with the non-zero photon mass. In this article, we first give a historical review
    of the foundation of Coulomb's inverse square law. Then, the experimental searches
    for validity of Coulomb's Law, particularly in its inverse square nature, are
    generally introduced. Based on Proca's equations, the unique simplest relativistic
    generalization of Maxwell's equations, the link between the deviation from Coulomb's
    Law and the upper limit on the photon rest mass based on the concentric-spheres
    apparatus established in the classical experiment of Cavendish is reviewed. Up
    to now, all the experiments show no evidence for a positive value, and the experimental
    result was customarily expressed as an upper limit on the deviation or on the
    photon rest mass. As a representative method with the double mission of testing
    of the validity of Coulomb's Law and of the photon rest mass, possible improvements
    for this kind of experiment are discussed.</p>"
