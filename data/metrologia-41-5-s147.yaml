  content: "<p>Automated measurements of the electric charge of fluid microdrops precise
    to up to 0.016 of an electron charge have been made using machine-vision systems
    to observe the motion of fluid microdrops in air under the influence of an oscillating
    electric field. The fluid drop diameters have ranged from 7 µm to 25 µm with smaller
    diameter drops being measured to higher precision. The experimental runs performed
    for the purpose of attempting to find isolated fractionally electrically charged
    particles have measured the charges of tens of millions of fluid microdrops using
    piezoelectrically driven drop-on-demand inkjet-like droplet ejectors as fluid
    drop sources.</p>"
