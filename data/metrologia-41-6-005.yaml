abstract:
- content: "<p>A redetermination of the argon mole fraction in air has been undertaken
    in two samples of dried natural air using mass spectrometric analysis with reference
    to a suite of gravimetrically prepared synthetic dry air mixtures. The resulting
    measurement of the argon mole fraction was 9.332 mmol mol<sup>−1</sup> with a
    combined standard uncertainty of 3 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. This is significantly
    different from the value, 9.17 mmol mol<sup>−1</sup>, conventionally employed
    in the CIPM formula for the determination of the density of moist air during mass
    standard comparisons. Using the presently reported argon mole fraction value in
    the CIPM formula rather than the conventional value removes the recently identified
    discrepancy between the two methods of determining the density of moist air during
    mass standard comparisons: the CIPM formula method and the air buoyancy artefacts
    method. Nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide mole fractions in the dry air samples
    were obtained simultaneously.</p>"
