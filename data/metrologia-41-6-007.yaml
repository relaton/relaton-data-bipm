abstract:
- content: "<p>A technique is introduced for realizing spectral irradiance in the
    range between 286 nm and 901 nm. The scale is based on a temperature-controlled
    filter radiometer constructed from a three-element silicon trap detector, band-pass
    filters and a precision aperture. Seasoned FEL-type quartz halogen lamps are used
    as reference standards. In this method, direct traceability of the radiometer
    to the cryogenic radiometer gives an important advantage in the visible and near-infrared
    regions. Another advantage of this system is the procedure followed for measurement
    of the distance between the lamp filament and aperture surface of the filter radiometer.
    The expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the spectral irradiance measurement is between
    2.3% and 1.5% in the UV region, while the uncertainty is of the order of 0.6%
    above 400 nm.</p>"
