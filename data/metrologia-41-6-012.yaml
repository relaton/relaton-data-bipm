abstract:
- content: "<p>Here, we analyse the chromaticity characteristics of the correlated
    colour temperature (CCT) and thermodynamic temperature of a radiating source.
    Our analysis correlates the colour coordinates of a radiating source to the CCT
    and gives the thermodynamic temperature and emissivity information related to
    the radiating source. The mathematical relationship between the CCT of the source
    and its thermodynamic temperature is presented. The simulation results indicate
    that there is a discrepancy between the CCT and its actual thermodynamic temperature,
    but the discrepancy may be estimated.</p>"
