    <p>For the purpose of calculating meniscus volume, an ellipsoidal air–liquid interface has been assumed. A formula for the meniscus volume as a function of the radius (<italic>r</italic>) of a tube and capillary constant (<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup>) has been derived without resorting to approximations or introducing any arbitrary variable. The formula holds good for all values of <italic>r</italic>/<italic>a</italic>. Earlier there were two distinct sets of formulae: one set of formulae was for smaller values of <italic>r</italic>/<italic>a</italic> from 0 up to 3.1 and another set was for wider tubes with <italic>r</italic>/<italic>a</italic> beginning from 6 onward. No formula existed for intermediate values of <italic>r</italic>/<italic>a</italic> from 3.2 to 5.9. The formula derived by the author is universal in this respect.</p>
    <p>The values of meniscus volumes derived from the author's formula agree very well with those given by Bashforth and Adams for smaller bore tubes.</p>
    <p>For wider tubes the values of meniscus volume derived from the author's formula are in general smaller but agree to within 10% of the mean values derived from the Rayleigh and Laplace formulae.</p>
