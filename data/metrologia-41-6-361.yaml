abstract:
- content: "<p>For the purpose of calculating meniscus volume, an ellipsoidal air–liquid
    interface has been assumed. A formula for the meniscus volume as a function of
    the radius (r) of a tube and capillary constant (a<sup>2</sup>) has been derived
    without resorting to approximations or introducing any arbitrary variable. The
    formula holds good for all values of r/a. Earlier there were two distinct sets
    of formulae: one set of formulae was for smaller values of r/a from 0 up to 3.1
    and another set was for wider tubes with r/a beginning from 6 onward. No formula
    existed for intermediate values of r/a from 3.2 to 5.9. The formula derived by
    the author is universal in this respect.</p><p>The values of meniscus volumes
    derived from the author's formula agree very well with those given by Bashforth
    and Adams for smaller bore tubes.</p><p>For wider tubes the values of meniscus
    volume derived from the author's formula are in general smaller but agree to within
    10% of the mean values derived from the Rayleigh and Laplace formulae.</p>"
