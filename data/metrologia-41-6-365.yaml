abstract:
- content: "<p>A two-stage transformer, built as a current comparator with a shielded
    magnetic core, is used to make a novel ac bridge for calibration of ac shunts
    for large currents and other ac current-to-voltage converters. A fine adjustable
    reference transresistance is made by current transformation and a non-reactive
    precision resistor connected to the secondary. By using an auxiliary transformer
    and resistor, all four two-stage transformer secondary terminals are brought to
    ground potential and consequently both magnetizing and capacitive errors are kept
    below one part per million.</p>"
