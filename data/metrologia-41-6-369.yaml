abstract:
- content: "<p>A value for the measurand determined from a computational model is
    frequently referred to as a virtual measurement to distinguish it from a physical
    measurement, which is determined from a laboratory experiment. Any measurement,
    physical or virtual, is incomplete without a quantitative statement of its associated
    uncertainty. The science and technology of making physical measurements and quantifying
    their uncertainties has evolved over many decades. In contrast, the science and
    technology of making virtual measurements is evolving. We propose an approach
    for quantifying the uncertainty associated with a virtual measurement of a molecular
    property determined from a computational quantum chemistry model. The proposed
    approach is based on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement,
    published by the International Organization for Standardization, and it uses the
    Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database maintained by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>"
