  content: "<p>A value for the measurand determined from a computational model is
    frequently referred to as a <italic>virtual measurement</italic> to distinguish
    it from a <italic>physical measurement</italic>, which is determined from a laboratory
    experiment. Any measurement, physical or virtual, is incomplete without a quantitative
    statement of its associated uncertainty. The science and technology of making
    physical measurements and quantifying their uncertainties has evolved over many
    decades. In contrast, the science and technology of making virtual measurements
    is evolving. We propose an approach for quantifying the uncertainty associated
    with a virtual measurement of a molecular property determined from a computational
    quantum chemistry model. The proposed approach is based on the <italic>Guide to
    the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>, published by the International
    Organization for Standardization, and it uses the Computational Chemistry Comparison
    and Benchmark Database maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>"
