abstract:
- content: "<p>We analyse the phase variations of the microwave field in a TE<sub>011</sub>
    microwave cavity and how these variations affect the frequency of an atomic clock.
    We analytically solve for the microwave fields in a TE<sub>011</sub> cavity. These
    analytic solutions show significant new terms that are not present in previous
    two-dimensional treatments. The new terms show that cavities with small radii,
    near 2.1 cm for a 9.2 GHz cavity, have smaller phase shifts than cavities with
    larger radii. We also show that the three-dimensional phase variations near the
    axis of the cavity can be efficiently calculated with a rapidly converging series
    of two-dimensional finite element calculations. The cavities used in atomic clocks
    have holes in the endcaps, and we use finite element methods to study the large
    fields and phase shifts near these holes. The effects of the phase variations
    on atoms traversing a cavity are analysed using the sensitivity function, and
    we present a cavity design that has small phase shifts for all atomic trajectories.
    For two π/2 pulses, the proposed cavity has transverse variations of the effective
    phase that are within ±0.1 µrad and produce no systematic frequency error for
    a nearly homogeneous and expanding cloud of atoms.</p>"
