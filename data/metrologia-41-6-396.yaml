  content: "<p>In the comparison in air of mass standards having different volumes,
    the major source of uncertainty arises from the determination of the density of
    moist air (buoyancy correction). The method being commonly used is the application
    of a recommended equation of state (CIPM 81/91 formula); a second method developed
    and used by only a few laboratories is based on two special artefacts having the
    same mass and surface area but very different volumes. Comparisons carried out
    by weighing the artefacts in air and in vacuum revealed a relative discrepancy
    of 6.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> between air density as measured by the artefacts and
    by the CIPM formula. Additional measurements were carried out at the BIPM in dry
    nitrogen. The comparison of the gas density obtained by the two methods confirmed
    the discrepancy already obtained for moist air but showed a much smaller discrepancy
    for dry nitrogen. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the accuracy of
    the air density using the CIPM formula is limited by the estimation of its composition,
    in particular the mole fraction of argon which may be underestimated. To test
    this hypothesis, an alternative value for the mole fraction of argon in air, arising
    from a recent redetermination, has been considered for use in the CIPM 81/91 formula.
    Modification of the CIPM 81/91 formula to include the recent argon determination
    would remove the discrepancy between the two methods of determining the density
    of moist air.</p>"
