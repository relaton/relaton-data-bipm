  content: "<p>A technique is introduced for realizing spectral irradiance in the
    range between 286 nm and 901 nm. The scale is based on a temperature-controlled
    filter radiometer constructed from a three-element silicon trap detector, band-pass
    filters and a precision aperture. Seasoned FEL-type quartz halogen lamps are used
    as reference standards. In this method, direct traceability of the radiometer
    to the cryogenic radiometer gives an important advantage in the visible and near-infrared
    regions. Another advantage of this system is the procedure followed for measurement
    of the distance between the lamp filament and aperture surface of the filter radiometer.
    The expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the spectral irradiance measurement
    is between 2.3% and 1.5% in the UV region, while the uncertainty is of the order
    of 0.6% above 400 nm.</p>"
