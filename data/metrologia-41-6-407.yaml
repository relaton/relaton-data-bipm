  content: "<p>A description of a detector-based realization of the unit of luminous
    flux (lumen) at the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) is presented. The
    realization is based on the absolute integrating-sphere method developed at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), with some modifications.
    The measurement set-up consists of a 1.65 m integrating sphere, two photometers,
    a precision aperture and an external luminous-flux source. The characterization
    and maintenance of the measurement system are described and the uncertainty budget
    of the realization is presented. The uncertainty analysis indicates a relative
    expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of 4.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup> for the
    realization. According to the results of an earlier bilateral comparison between
    the HUT and the NIST, the ratio of the measured luminous flux value of HUT to
    that of NIST was 1.0006 with an expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2)
    of 10 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, including uncertainties due to realization of the units.
    Another indirect test measurement indicated a corresponding ratio of 0.9984 with
    the luminous flux measurements of BIPM with an expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2) of 11 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, including uncertainties due to realization of the
    units.</p>"
