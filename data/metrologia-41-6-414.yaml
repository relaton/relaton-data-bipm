abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe an original algorithm for extraction of the local value
    of the Earth's gravity from the measured trajectory, h(t), of a test mass thrown
    up vertically. This algorithm relies upon separate adjustment of the rising and
    the falling parts of the test mass motion to an assumed model of the trajectory,
    and then connecting both limbs at the apex to obtain a complete ballistic curve.
    This complete curve is adjusted finally to the motion model to obtain the values
    of g, other trajectory parameters and the height residuals versus time curve.
    Within the procedure for connecting the two limbs at the apex, the two limbs are
    adjusted separately; some mechanisms are included that allow partial elimination
    of errors arising from microseisms and other disturbances. Standard methods of
    adjustment calculus used in geodesy are used in the fitting process.</p>"
