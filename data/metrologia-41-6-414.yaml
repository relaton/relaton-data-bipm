abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>We describe an original algorithm for extraction of the local value
    of the Earth's gravity from the measured trajectory, <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>),
    of a test mass thrown up vertically. This algorithm relies upon separate adjustment
    of the rising and the falling parts of the test mass motion to an assumed model
    of the trajectory, and then connecting both limbs at the apex to obtain a complete
    ballistic curve. This complete curve is adjusted finally to the motion model to
    obtain the values of <italic>g</italic>, other trajectory parameters and the height
    residuals versus time curve. Within the procedure for connecting the two limbs
    at the apex, the two limbs are adjusted separately; some mechanisms are included
    that allow partial elimination of errors arising from microseisms and other disturbances.
    Standard methods of adjustment calculus used in geodesy are used in the fitting
    process.</p>"
