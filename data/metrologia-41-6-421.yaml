  content: "<p>The Monte Carlo method is applied to the computation of the effective
    emissivity of a specularâ€“diffuse isothermal blackbody cavity shaped by a cylindrical
    generatrix, a flat inclined bottom and a flat diaphragm. The dependences of the
    normal effective emissivity on the bottom inclination angle are studied for different
    cavity depths and various values of the diffuse component of the cavity wall reflectance.
    The distributions of the local normal effective emissivity over the cavity aperture
    and the dependences of the integrated effective emissivity on the distance between
    the aperture and the radiation detector are computed. The choice of optimal geometrical
    parameters for improving the radiometric performance of artificial blackbodies
    is discussed.</p>"
