abstract:
- content: "<p>Recently, the Istituto di Metrologia 'GÂ Colonnetti' (IMGC) and the
    \nNational Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) reported joint measurements of
    \nthe (220) lattice plane spacing of Si. These measurements were carried out \nat
    both the IMGC and the NMIJ to resolve a discrepancy between previous \ndeterminations.
    It has been found subsequently that the laser beam used in \nthe IMGC apparatus
    was not perfectly monochromatic, and consequently an \nerror occurred in the IMGC's
    measurement.</p><p>Full details are provided in the PDF file.</p>"
