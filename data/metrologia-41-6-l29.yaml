abstract:
- content: "<p>In addition to earlier experiments on the determination of G that were
    carried out in the PTB, supplementary investigations of the electrostatic torque
    transmitter unit have been performed. We have identified a previously overlooked
    effect that is capable of reducing the deviation from other determinations by
    an order of magnitude. Additionally, the uncertainty associated with the former
    value has to be enlarged.</p>"
