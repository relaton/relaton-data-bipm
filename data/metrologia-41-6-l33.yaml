abstract:
- content: "<p>The International System of Units is presented in the SI brochure,
    where not only are the base units of the System defined, but many of the System's
    derived units are also proposed. The latter are of quantities that the brochure
    names but does not define; they are well-known quantities or are derived in definitions
    to be found elsewhere. However, many of the brochure's derived units have been
    subject to algebraic manipulation that makes them unrecognizable as units of the
    defined quantity. They do not conform to the VIM's definition of ‘unit’ and are
    in no sense units of the quantities with which they are associated. This paper
    questions their usefulness and suggests that derived units be defined only by
    the definitions of their quantities and of the base units of the system. They
    cannot be simplified algebraically and remain units of those quantities.</p>"
