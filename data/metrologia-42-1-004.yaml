abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose new criteria to help select a subset of peer results for
    determining a weighted-mean Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) for describing
    Key Comparisons supporting the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). Often
    the results are all well behaved: their scatter is in the range expected from
    the Gaussian probability distributions associated with their stated standard uncertainties.
    In this case, the KCRV would usually be the inverse-variance weighted mean of
    all eligible results, the maximum likelihood estimate of independent Gaussian
    probability distributions. If most—but not all—of the results are well behaved,
    the comparison may be better described in terms of a KCRV computed with ‘outliers’
    excluded from the weighted mean. An outlier's effects are quantified in terms
    of the logarithmic slope and logarithmic curvature of its associated probability
    density function in the vicinity of the consensus value. The outer tails of the
    probability distributions are generally not known with confidence, so two new
    criteria are suggested to help justify the identification of outliers: one based
    on uncertainty in the logarithmic slope, and the other based on uncertainty about
    whether the logarithmic curvature is negative definite.</p>"
