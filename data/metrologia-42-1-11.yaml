abstract:
- content: "<p>A model and supporting measurements are presented for the laminar flow
    of gases through a long capillary with a circular cross section. Using the model
    with a coil of quartz capillary of known dimensions yields the flow rates of a
    gas of known viscosity with an uncertainty of 0.04%. Alternatively, combining
    the model and capillary with an independent measurement of flow rate yields the
    gas viscosity with similar uncertainty. The model corrects the Hagen–Poiseuille
    equation for (1) departures from ideal gas behaviour, (2) slip at the capillary
    walls, (3) kinetic energy changes at the capillary entrance, (4) gas expansion
    along the length of the capillary, (5) viscous heating and (6) centrifugal effects
    that occur when a long capillary is coiled to fit into a small volume. The corrections
    are expressed in terms of familiar dimensionless parameters.</p><p>Measurements
    near room temperature using helium, nitrogen, argon, propane and sulfur hexafluoride
    demonstrated that the model describes the flow rates of gases with widely varying
    properties at Reynolds numbers as large as 1000. Combining the flow rates with
    independent measurements of the capillary length and radius yielded new absolute
    viscosity values for the five gases at 25 °C with an uncertainty of 0.04%. This
    small uncertainty was verified independently by comparing the result for the viscosity
    of helium to recent calculations using quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.
    The present results allow one to construct a flow meter or viscometer of similar
    accuracy with no measurement of the capillary radius and only a nominal measurement
    of the capillary length.</p>"
