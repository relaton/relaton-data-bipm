abstract:
- content: "<p>For an absolute measurement of a density standard, mass and volume
    are measured separately. The absolute determination of the volume is still the
    quantity limiting the uncertainty. Lowest uncertainties are achieved by interferometric
    measurements of the diameter of spheres made from a silicon single crystal. So
    far, measurements have been based on a plane interferometer. At PTB, we demonstrate
    a new method of determining the diameter using a spherical interferometer, which
    yields more and particular information about the resulting volume.</p>"
