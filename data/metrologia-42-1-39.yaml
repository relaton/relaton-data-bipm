abstract:
- content: "<p>We compare the performance of two procedures used for the evaluation
    of uncertainty of derivatives computed from a polynomial fitted to experimental
    data. These procedures agree with international recommendations and they are valid
    independently of the experimental technique used to obtain the data. The first
    procedure involves performing a least-squares polynomial adjustment under uncertainty.
    The second procedure is based on Monte Carlo techniques. Both are computer-assisted.
    As an example, we evaluated the standard uncertainty associated with the gradient
    of a surface fitted to experimental data that formed a set of points in a three-dimensional
    space. We found that both methods render very similar results.</p>"
