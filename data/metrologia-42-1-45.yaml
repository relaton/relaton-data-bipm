  content: "<p>The corrections for the influence of atmospheric pressure on the sensitivity
    levels of laboratory standard microphones vary with frequency. The sensitivity
    level pressure corrections for Brüel and Kjær 4180 and G.R.A.S. 40AG laboratory
    standard microphones were measured. Over the barometric pressure range from 94 kPa
    to 106 kPa, the sensitivity levels of the model 4180 and model 40AG laboratory
    standard microphones changed by 0.05 dB at 1 kHz and 0.12 dB at 20 kHz, respectively.
    Empirical equations for sensitivity level pressure corrections for the above microphones
    are presented.</p>"
