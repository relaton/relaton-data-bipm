abstract:
- content: "<p>A new caesium fountain frequency standard (NPL-CsF1) at the National
    Physical Laboratory is described. Procedures for evaluation of the systematic
    frequency shifts are presented. The NPL-CsF1 has a short-term stability σ<sub>y</sub>(τ)
    = 1.4 × 10<sup>−13</sup>τ<sup>−1/2</sup>, predominantly due to the local oscillator
    phase noise. The accuracy of 1 part in 10<sup>15</sup> is limited by the uncertainty
    of the frequency shift due to collisions between cold atoms.</p>"
