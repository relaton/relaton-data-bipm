  content: "<p>At an advanced stage of our investigations, a private communication
    from Clive Speake [1] pointed out that the discrepancy between our earlier measurements
    of <italic>G</italic> [2] and the CODATA value may have been due to additional
    contributions to the electrostatic calibration torque from previously omitted
    partial capacitances, as discussed in section 2.3 of [2].</p>\n<p>We gratefully
    acknowledge this suggestion, which eventually proved to be correct.  Due to a
    misunderstanding during the reviewing process, this acknowledgment was omitted
    in the recent publication.</p>\n<p><bold>References</bold> \nSpeake C C 2004 private
