abstract:
- content: "<p>At an advanced stage of our investigations, a private communication
    from Clive Speake [1] pointed out that the discrepancy between our earlier measurements
    of G [2] and the CODATA value may have been due to additional contributions to
    the electrostatic calibration torque from previously omitted partial capacitances,
    as discussed in section 2.3 of [2].</p><p>We gratefully acknowledge this suggestion,
    which eventually proved to be correct. Due to a misunderstanding during the reviewing
    process, this acknowledgment was omitted in the recent publication.</p><p>References
