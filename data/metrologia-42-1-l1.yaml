abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Temperature Scale of 1990 assigns temperatures to
    the solidâ€“liquid phase transitions (triple points, melting points, freezing points)
    of various substances. Since the ideally pure substances of the definition are
    unattainable in practice, the influence of impurities must be accounted for. Frequently,
    this is the dominant uncertainty component in realizing these most important reference
    temperatures. While a number of methods have been employed to estimate the uncertainty
    arising from the impurity effect, current thinking appears to have converged on
    methods that depend on chemical analyses of the materials employed. For the majority
    of cases, the demands of the thermometry community exceed the capabilities of
    routine analytical chemistry. It may, therefore, be necessary to consider a concerted
    action to rigorously characterize homogeneous batches of material using as many
    techniques as can reasonably be brought to bear on the problem in an effort to
    develop certified reference materials to serve both the thermometry and chemical
    metrology communities.</p>"
