  content: "<p>A nickel carbon eutectic point was realized by a radiation thermometer
    for two geometrically different fixed point cells made by an optimized filling
    process. The process was based on monitoring the variation of the melting–freezing
    temperature difference as a function of the filling ratio of the cell. The integrity
    of construction and the filling endpoint could be confirmed by observing a clear
    convergence of the melting–freezing temperature difference as the filling ratio
    increases. From 14 sets of realizations with two different cells and two different
    spectral bands of the radiation thermometer, the eutectic temperature is determined
    to be 1328.73 °C with an expanded uncertainty of 0.22 °C (<italic>k</italic> =
