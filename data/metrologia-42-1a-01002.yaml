abstract:
- content: "<p>From August 1995 to September 1998, the CCEM-K6.c Key Comparison (which
    started as the CCE 92-05 comparison) of ac–dc voltage transfer standards at selected
    high frequencies between 1 MHz and 100 MHz was carried out. Subsequently, from
    December 1998 until mid 2000, some participants carried out additional measurements.</p><p>Two
    travelling standards were measured by 15 national standard institutes. The results
    at all selected frequencies in the range from 1 MHz to 100 MHz show a good agreement
    between most of participants. The agreement at 1 MHz is within 10 µV/V for most
    of the participants. The span of the majority of the reported ac–dc differences
    at 50 MHz is less than 0.6 mV/V, which is similar to a previous comparison but
    with more participants. Even at 100 MHz, most obtained results are within a span
    of 3 mV/V, which is considered to be a good agreement.</p><p>Main text. To reach
    the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
