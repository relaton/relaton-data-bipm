    <p>From August 1995 to September 1998, the CCEM-K6.c Key Comparison (which started as the CCE 92-05 comparison) of ac–dc voltage transfer standards at selected high frequencies between 1 MHz and 100 MHz was carried out. Subsequently, from December 1998 until mid 2000, some participants carried out additional measurements.</p>
    <p>Two travelling standards were measured by 15 national standard institutes. The results at all selected frequencies in the range from 1 MHz to 100 MHz show a good agreement between most of participants. The agreement at 1 MHz is within 10 µV/V for most of the participants. The span of the majority of the reported ac–dc differences at 50 MHz is less than 0.6 mV/V, which is similar to a previous comparison but with more participants. Even at 100 MHz, most obtained results are within a span of 3 mV/V, which is considered to be a good agreement.</p>
