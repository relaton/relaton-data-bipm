    <p>Comparison EUROMET.EM-K8.1 was a follow-up to comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/41/01001">EUROMET.EM-K8</ext-link> and was organized for those participants in EUROMET.EM-K8 willing to improve their results. It had the same pilot laboratory and the same protocol as the other K8 comparisons and its travelling standard was the same resistive divider already used in comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/40/01001">CCEM-K8</ext-link>. On this divider the measurements of voltage ratios 1000 V/10 V and 100 V/10 V were mandatory; the measurements of other ratios were optional. Four laboratories, plus the pilot, participated, but one of them withdrew from the comparison before the Draft A report was released. The degrees of equivalence with respect to the Key Comparison Reference Value, which is the reference value of comparison CCEM-K8, were evaluated by using the results of the pilot laboratory to link the two comparisons. With the exception of one result, which is on the boundary of the 95% confidence interval, the agreement of the other results with the reference value is excellent.</p>
