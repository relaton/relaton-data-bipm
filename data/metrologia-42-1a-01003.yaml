abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparison EUROMET.EM-K8.1 was a follow-up to comparison EUROMET.EM-K8
    and was organized for those participants in EUROMET.EM-K8 willing to improve their
    results. It had the same pilot laboratory and the same protocol as the other K8
    comparisons and its travelling standard was the same resistive divider already
    used in comparison CCEM-K8. On this divider the measurements of voltage ratios
    1000 V/10 V and 100 V/10 V were mandatory; the measurements of other ratios were
    optional. Four laboratories, plus the pilot, participated, but one of them withdrew
    from the comparison before the Draft A report was released. The degrees of equivalence
    with respect to the Key Comparison Reference Value, which is the reference value
    of comparison CCEM-K8, were evaluated by using the results of the pilot laboratory
    to link the two comparisons. With the exception of one result, which is on the
    boundary of the 95% confidence interval, the agreement of the other results with
    the reference value is excellent.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this

    B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
