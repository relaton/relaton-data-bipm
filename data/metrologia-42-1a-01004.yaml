abstract:
- content: "<p>Seven European national metrology institutes and one commercial laboratory
    participated in this international comparison of instrument voltage transformers
    in the range of primary voltage from 5 kV up to 22 kV.</p><p>Two instrument voltage
    transformers (IVT) with transformation ratios (5 and 10) kV/100 V and 22 kV/100 V
    served as transfer standards. The measured quantities were the voltage ratio error
    and the phase displacement. The measurements were performed at a frequency of
    50 Hz and with a burden of  B = 1 VA at unity power factor. The errors of the
    transfer standards were measured with (40, 60, 80, 100 and 120)% of the rated
    value of the primary voltage.</p><p>By result processing it was supposed that
    results of individual laboratories are not correlated. The comparison reference
    values (CRVs) and their uncertainties were calculated as weighted means. The consistency
    of the CRVs was checked using the χ<sup>2</sup> test and Birge ratio. The confidence
    coefficient  E of individual laboratories was calculated for CRVs that did not
    pass the Birge ratio test. Results of laboratories with  E &gt; 1.5 were not included
    in the calculation of the corrected CRVs.</p><p>The differences from the CRVs
    and their uncertainties presented in tables and graphs are the results of the
    comparison. The good results of this comparison prove the good calibration capabilities
    of the participants in the field of instrument transformers.</p><p>Main text.
