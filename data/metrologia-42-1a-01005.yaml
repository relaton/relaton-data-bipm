abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this comparison was to compare Josephson voltage standards
    by using the new VNIIM portable Josephson standard voltage (PJVS) as travelling
    standard. The comparison was carried out under the auspices of EUROMET (Project
    723) from September 2003 to May 2004. It was aimed to link more laboratories organized
    in EUROMET. In addition, the comparison provides a link between EUROMET, COOMET
    and the BIPM. Twelve national metrology institutes and the BIPM participated,
    with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Braunschweig, Germany) acting
    as pilot laboratory.</p><p>The PJVS was accompanied and operated by a VNIIM specialist.
    The technical protocol requested to measure a 1 V fixed output voltage at an output
    resistance of 4 Ω, while measurements at 1.2 kΩ output resistance were optional.
    The comparisons were performed in a similar way to the new so-called 'option B'
    bilateral comparisons carried out by the BIPM; the NMIs had to use their own null
    detector, polarity switch and measurement procedure to measure the output voltage
    of the PJVS. This method of comparison is more closely related to standard electronic
    voltage reference (e.g. Zener) measurements but without the limitation to their
    noise. During all comparisons the PJVS was connected to the same time base as
    that used by the laboratory Josephson voltage standard.</p><p>The results demonstrate
    that the idea of using a portable quantum standard based on a programmable Josephson
    array as a travelling standard is a powerful tool to achieve equivalence between
    institutes quickly and at a very good level of uncertainty. Several institutes
    achieved a relative uncertainty clearly better than one part in 10<sup>9</sup>
    at a 95% level of confidence.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
