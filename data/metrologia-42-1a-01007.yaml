abstract:
- content: "<p>With respect to the measurements of the dc coil constant, three institutes
    applying nuclear magnetic resonance methods, and thus providing the lowest uncertainty
    budgets, participated in both the   EUROMET 466 comparison  and the the   CCEM.M-K1
    comparison. Based on their results obtained in the particular comparison, it is
    possible to relate to each other the values of the dc coil constants of the different
    standards circulated within the particular comparison.</p><p>All results reported
    by the participants in the EUROMET comparison cover within their uncertainties
    the mean value of the dc coil constant   k<sub>wm</sub> obtained within the CCEM
    comparison.</p><p>With respect to the measurements of the coil constant's dependence
    on frequency, four institutes took part in both comparisons. Again, based on their
    results obtained in the particular comparison, a transfer function is established
    to relate the different frequency responses of the two standard coils to each
    other. After multiplying the EUROMET result with this transfer function it agrees
    very well with the CCEM result.</p><p> Main text.  To reach the main text of this

    B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to
    the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
