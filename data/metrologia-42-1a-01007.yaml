    <p>With respect to the measurements of the dc coil constant, three institutes applying nuclear magnetic resonance methods, and thus providing the lowest uncertainty budgets, participated in both the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/38/187">EUROMET 466 comparison</ext-link> and the the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/42/01006">CCEM.M-K1 comparison</ext-link>. Based on their results obtained in the particular comparison, it is possible to relate to each other the values of the dc coil constants of the different standards circulated within the particular comparison.</p>
    <p>All results reported by the participants in the EUROMET comparison cover within their uncertainties the mean value of the dc coil constant  <italic>k</italic><sub>wm</sub> obtained within the CCEM comparison.</p>
    <p>With respect to the measurements of the coil constant's dependence on frequency, four institutes took part in both comparisons. Again, based on their results obtained in the particular comparison, a transfer function is established to relate the different frequency responses of the two standard coils to each other. After multiplying the EUROMET result with this transfer function it agrees very well with the CCEM result.</p>
