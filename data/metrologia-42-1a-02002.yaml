    <p>A bilateral comparison of illuminance responsivity scales between the UME and the IFA-CSIC was carried out, where the IFA-CSIC acted as the pilot and link to the key comparison CCPR-K3.b. The ratio of the measured illuminance responsivities (UME/IFA) was 1.0003 with expanded uncertainty of 0.0084 (k = 2) including the uncertainty of the comparison and the uncertainties of the realization of the scales.</p><p>Main text.
