    <p>Lasers from four national metrological institutes (NMIs) were brought to the BIPM in May 2005 as part of the BIPM.L-K11 ongoing key comparison initiated by the Comité Consultative des Longueurs (CCL) 11th meeting in 2003. The absolute frequency of the f component of the R(127) 11-5 transition was measured for these lasers following the Protocol for BIPM.L-K11. The results of these measurements are compiled in the present paper. The comparison reports, as communicated by each participant, are included as Appendices.</p>
