abstract:
- content: "<p>Lasers from four national metrological institutes (NMIs) were brought
    to the BIPM in May 2005 as part of the BIPM.L-K11 ongoing key comparison initiated
    by the Comité Consultative des Longueurs (CCL) 11th meeting in 2003. The absolute
    frequency of the f component of the R(127) 11-5 transition was measured for these
    lasers following the Protocol for BIPM.L-K11. The results of these measurements
    are compiled in the present paper. The comparison reports, as communicated by
    each participant, are included as Appendices.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
