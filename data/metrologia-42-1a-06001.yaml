abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of the pure β-emitter<sup>90</sup>Y has
    been performed recently, with comparison identifier, CCRI(II)-K2.Y-90. A total
    of eight laboratories performed assays for radioactivity content on aliquots of
    a common master solution of<sup>90</sup>Y prepared by the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST). The average activity concentration of the solution
    measured by the laboratories was 8664 kBq g<sup>-1</sup>; u = 4 kBq g<sup>-1</sup>
    at a reference time of 0 h UTC 1 November 2003. Using this value as the key comparison
    reference value, degrees of equivalence and their associated uncertainties have
    been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the eight
    participants. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text. To reach

    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to
    the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
