    <p>An international comparison of the pure β-emitter  <sup>90</sup>Y has been performed recently, with comparison identifier, CCRI(II)-K2.Y-90. A total of eight laboratories performed assays for radioactivity content on aliquots of a common master solution of  <sup>90</sup>Y prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The average activity concentration of the solution measured by the laboratories was 8664 kBq g<sup>-1</sup>;   <italic>u</italic> = 4 kBq g<sup>-1</sup> at a reference time of 0 h UTC 1 November 2003. Using this value as the key comparison reference value, degrees of equivalence and their associated uncertainties have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the eight participants. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
