    <p>International comparisons of absorbed dose have been made at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) since 1988. Thirteen national metrology institutes have taken part, some of which have repeated the comparison over the years. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) is taken as unity, each comparison result being the ratio of the national metrology institute's (NMI) evaluation to that of the BIPM's stable standard. The degrees of equivalence between each NMI and the KCRV, and between each pair of NMIs, are given in the form of a matrix, using the most recent result for each of eleven NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
