abstract:
- content: "<p>Prior to 2002, no comparisons of radon activity concentration had been
    performed within the scope of the EUROMET. The comparison presented here fulfils
    the need to provide confidence in the capability of national metrology institutes
    and calibration laboratories to measure radon activity concentration in air. This
    has been achieved by the measurement of radon reference atmospheres using an electronic,
    radon measuring instrument as the transfer comparison device (CD). Each of the
    twelve institutes, from nine countries, calibrated the CD using standard calibration
    procedures according to their quality system, at three different activity concentrations:
    1 kBq/m<sup>3</sup>, 3 kBq/m<sup>3</sup> and 10 kBq/m<sup>3</sup>. For each activity
    concentration, a comparison reference value and its uncertainty have been derived.
    From these the degrees of equivalence have been calculated and are presented graphically
    and in the form of matrices. All the results are consistent within the assigned
    uncertainties.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on

    key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by EUROMET, according to the provisions of the Mutual
    Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
