    <p>In 2004 the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) submitted two samples of known activity of  <sup>131</sup>I to the International Reference System (SIR) to replace their 1993 SIR measurement. The values of the activity submitted were about 43 MBq. The key comparison result has been added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence that now contains 13 results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.I-131.</p>
