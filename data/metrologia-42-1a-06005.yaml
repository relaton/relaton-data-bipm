abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2004, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) submitted a sample
    of known activity of<sup>22</sup>Na to the International Reference System (SIR)
    for the first time. The value of the activity submitted was about 1.4 MBq. This
    key comparison result has been added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence in
    the key comparison database that now contains eleven results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Na-22.</p><p>Main
    text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this
    text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to
    the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
