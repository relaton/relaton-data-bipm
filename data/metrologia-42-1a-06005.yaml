    <p>In 2004, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) submitted a sample of known activity of  <sup>22</sup>Na to the International Reference System (SIR) for the first time. The value of the activity submitted was about 1.4 MBq. This key comparison result has been added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database that now contains eleven results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Na-22. </p>
