    <p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the Bureau National de Métrologie – Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (BNM-LNHB), Saclay, France and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has been made in  <sup>60</sup>Co radiation under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. The comparison result expressed as a ratio of the BNM-LNHB and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water is 0.9970 (0.0053). The degrees of equivalence between the BNM-LNHB and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the 12 national metrology institutes (NMIs) that have taken part in the ongoing comparison for absorbed dose to water. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
