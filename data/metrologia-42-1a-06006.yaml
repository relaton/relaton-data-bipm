abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the Bureau
    National de Métrologie – Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (BNM-LNHB), Saclay,
    France and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has been made
    in<sup>60</sup>Co radiation under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4.
    The comparison result expressed as a ratio of the BNM-LNHB and the BIPM standards
    for absorbed dose to water is 0.9970 (0.0053). The degrees of equivalence between
    the BNM-LNHB and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the 12 national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) that have taken part in the ongoing comparison for absorbed
    dose to water. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text. To reach
    the main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section I
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(I)), according to the
    provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
