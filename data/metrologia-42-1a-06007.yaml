abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2003, the CCRI(II) decided that an indirect comparison of<sup>18</sup>F
    measurements piloted by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK in 2001 was
    sufficiently well constructed that it could be converted into a CCRI(II) comparison,
    with comparison identifier CCRI(II)-K3.F-18. At the same time, the pilot laboratory
    made a bilateral comparison with the institute in Chinese Taipei, comparison identifier
    APMP.RI(II)-K3.F-18. The results of the comparisons have been reported and the
    key comparison working group (KCWG) of the CCRI(II) has approved the mechanism
    to link all the results to the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of<sup>18</sup>F.
    The KCRV has been determined through the International Reference System (SIR)
    for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM),
    with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18. These comparisons have enabled
    a further four results to be added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence for<sup>18</sup>F
    activity measurements.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper,

    of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to the provisions of the
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
