    <p>In 2004, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) submitted two samples of known activity of  <sup>153</sup>Sm to the International Reference System (SIR). The value of the activity submitted was about 920 MBq. This key comparison result has been added to the matrix of degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database that now contains five results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Sm-153.</p>
