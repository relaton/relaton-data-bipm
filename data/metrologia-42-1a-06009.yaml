    <p>In 2004, the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Geel) each submitted one sample of known activity of  <sup>137</sup>Cs to the International Reference System (SIR). The NMIJ submission replaces their 1994 SIR measurement and the IRMM is their first measurement in the SIR. The values of the activity submitted were about 2.7 MBq and 0.98 MBq. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) and the degrees of equivalence have been recalculated to include these latest values. The results are given in the form of a matrix that now contains 13 results, comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-137, to which the five remaining eligible results from the CCRI(II)-K2.Cs-137 held in 1982 are linked.</p>
