abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2004, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany) and
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) each submitted
    one sample of known activity of<sup>109</sup>Cd to the International Reference
    System (SIR). The PTB result replaces their previous measurement of 1994 and the
    NIST result updates their 1986 CCRI(II) comparison result. The values of the activity
    submitted were about 15 MBq and 42 MBq. The new key comparison results have replaced
    the earlier values in the matrix of degrees of equivalence that now contains six
    results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cd-109, to which the remaining eleven results
    from the CCRI(II)-K2.Cd-109 held in 1986 are still linked.</p><p>Main text. To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to
    the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
