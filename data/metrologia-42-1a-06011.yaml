    <p>In 2004, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) each submitted one sample of known activity of  <sup>109</sup>Cd to the International Reference System (SIR). The PTB result replaces their previous measurement of 1994 and the NIST result updates their 1986 CCRI(II) comparison result. The values of the activity submitted were about 15 MBq and 42 MBq. The new key comparison results have replaced the earlier values in the matrix of degrees of equivalence that now contains six results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cd-109, to which the remaining eleven results from the CCRI(II)-K2.Cd-109 held in 1986 are still linked.</p>
