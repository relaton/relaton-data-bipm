abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 2004, the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements
    (IRMM, Geel, Belgium), Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany), Országos
    Mérésügyi Hivatal (OMH, Hungary), Laboratoire national de métrologie et d'essais–Laboratoire
    national Henri Becquerel (LNE–LNHB, France) and the National Metrology Institute
    of Japan (NMIJ) each submitted one sample of known activity of<sup>134</sup>Cs
    to the International Reference System (SIR). The OMH, PTB and LNE–LNHB results
    replace their 1992, 1994 and 1998 SIR measurements respectively while the IRMM
    and NMIJ submissions are their first measurements in the SIR, replacing the 1978
    CCRI(II) comparison results. The values of the activity submitted were between
    about 0.6 MBq and 5.4 MBq. The key comparison results have been added to the matrix
    of degrees of equivalence that now contains 12 results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-134,
    to which the remaining ten eligible results from the CCRI(II)-K2.Cs-134 held in
    1978 are linked.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing
    Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA).</p>"
