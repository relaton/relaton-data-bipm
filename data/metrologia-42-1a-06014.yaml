abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2004, the NMIJ, Japan and the NPL, UK submitted two new samples
    of known activity of<sup>51</sup>Cr to the International Reference System (SIR)
    for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, with
    comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cr-51. The activities were about 3.8 MBq
    and 7.9 MBq. The measurements update earlier submissions. The degrees of equivalence
    have been calculated between each of the equivalent activity results for the nine
    national metrology institutes measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV). At the same time as their submission to the SIR, the NMIJ sent an
    ampoule to the VNIIM to participate in the APMP.RI(II)-K2.Cr-51 comparison. The
    results of the VNIIM as described in this report are consequently linked to the
    BIPM comparison through the NMIJ. All the results are given in the form of a matrix
    with a graphical presentation.</p><p> Main text.  To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on   Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative
    Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to the provisions of the
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
