    <p>In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, submitted an ampoule with about 27 MBq activity of  <sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup> to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), as part of the  BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparison. Five other national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted eight samples since 1983. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been recalculated to include the latest primary result as this reduces the uncertainty of the evaluation. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR are given in the form of a matrix for all six NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
