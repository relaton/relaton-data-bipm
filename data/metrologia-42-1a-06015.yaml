abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2005, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, submitted an ampoule
    with about 27 MBq activity of<sup>99</sup>Tc<sup>m</sup> to the International
    Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures (BIPM), as part of the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparison. Five
    other national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted eight samples since 1983.
    The key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been recalculated to include the
    latest primary result as this reduces the uncertainty of the evaluation. The degrees
    of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR are given
    in the form of a matrix for all six NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main
    text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this
    text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to
    the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
