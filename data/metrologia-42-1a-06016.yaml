    <p>Since 2004, the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) have submitted samples of known activity of  <sup>57</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR). The values of the activity submitted were about 1.8 MBq and 1.3 MBq respectively. These key comparison results have replaced the previous results for Japan and Germany in the matrix of degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database that contains 14 results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-57.</p>
