    <p>The CCM.M-K3 comparison is based on a decision taken by the 'Comité Consultatif pour la Masse et les Grandeurs Apparentées' (CCM) during its 7th session in May 1999. The comparison is piloted by the BNM-LNE, organized in three petals (petal 1, 2 and 3), and uses two 50 kg travelling standards. Fourteen laboratories calibrated one of the travelling standards between March 2001 and February 2002. The key comparison reference value accepted by the participants is the median of the corrected laboratory results. The degree of equivalence of each laboratory with respect to the reference value and the degree of equivalence between two laboratories have been calculated. These terms and their expanded uncertainties are given in matrix form. A graphical presentation is also shown.</p>
