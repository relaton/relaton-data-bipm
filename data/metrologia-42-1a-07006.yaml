    <p>This report describes the results of a key comparison of hydraulic high-pressure standards at 16 national metrology institutes (NMIs: NMIJ/AIST, NPLI, CSIR-NML, NIS, KRISS, SCL, SPRING, NMIA, VMI, NML-SIRIM, KIM-LIPI, NSCL, PTB, NIMT, CMS/ITRI and NIM) was carried out during the period October 2002 to July 2004 within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) in order to determine their degrees of equivalence at pressures in the range 10 MPa to 100 MPa for gauge mode. The pilot institute was the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ)/AIST. All participating institutes generally used hydraulic pressure balances as their pressure standards. High-precision pressure transducers were used as transfer standards. The sensing element of the transducer was a precision quartz crystal resonator. To ensure the reliability of the transfer standard, two pressure transducers were used on a transfer standard unit. Three nominally identical transfer packages were circulated independently to reduce the time required for the measurements. During this comparison, the three transfer standards were calibrated simultaneously at the pilot institute 11 times in total. From the calibration results, the behaviours of the transfer standards during the comparison period were well characterized and it was presented that the capabilities of the transfer standards to achieve this key comparison were sufficient. The degrees of equivalence of each national measurement standard were expressed quantitatively by two terms, deviations from the key comparison reference values and pair-wise differences of their deviations. The degrees of equivalence in this comparison were also transferred to the corresponding CCM key comparison, CCM.M.P-K7. The hydraulic pressure standards in the range 10 MPa to 100 MPa for gauge mode of the 16 participating NMIs were found to be equivalent within their claimed uncertainties.</p>
