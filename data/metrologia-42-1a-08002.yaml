abstract:
- content: "<p>Following-up the key comparison   CCQM-K1c, EUROMET organized a regional
    key comparison involving ten laboratories. The objectives of this EUROMET key
    comparison were essentially the same as for the CCQM-K1c comparison: to compare
    the measurement capabilities of national metrological institutes (NMIs) in measuring
    amount of substance fractions of nitrogen monoxide in nitrogen. The nominal amount
    of substance fraction of the standards used for the comparison was 100 µmol/mol.
    The pilot laboratory in this key comparison also piloted the CCQM key comparison
    and has long-term experience in the behaviour of these mixtures and the technical
    challenges in preparing batches of very similar mixtures. Most participants used
    chemiluminescence as the measurement method; two participants used UV techniques
    and one ND-IR.</p><p>The degrees of equivalence between this comparison and CCQM-K1c
    were calculated; four laboratories participated in both key comparisons, thus
    providing sufficient data for demonstrating the comparability.</p><p> Main text.

    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the\nCCQM, according
    to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
