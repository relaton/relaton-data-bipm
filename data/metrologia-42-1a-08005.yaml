    <p>Ethanol is important both forensically ('drunk driving' or driving while under the influence, 'DWI', regulations) and commercially (alcoholic beverages).  Blood- and breath-alcohol testing can be imposed on individuals operating private vehicles such as cars, boats, or snowmobiles, or operators of commercial vehicles like trucks, planes, and ships.  The various levels of blood alcohol that determine whether these operators are considered legally impaired vary depending on the circumstances and locality. Accurate calibration and validation of instrumentation is critical in areas of forensic testing where quantitative analysis directly affects the outcome of criminal prosecutions, as is the case with the determination of ethanol in blood and breath.  Additionally, the accurate assessment of the alcoholic content of beverages is a commercially important commodity.</p>
    <p>In 2002, the CCQM conducted a Key Comparison (CCQM-K27) for the determination of ethanol in aqueous matrix with nine participants.  A report on this project has been approved by the CCQM and can be found at the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kcdb.bipm.org/AppendixB/appbresults/ccqm-k27.a/ccqm-k27.a_final_report.pdf">BIPM website</ext-link> and in this  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/41/08002">Technical Supplement</ext-link>.  CCQM-K27 comprised three samples, one at low mass fraction of ethanol in water (nominal concentration of 0.8 mg/g), one at high level (nominal concentration of 120 mg/g), and one wine matrix (nominal concentration of 81 mg/g).  Overall agreement among eight participants using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID), titrimetry, isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-IDMS), and gas chromatography–combustion–isotope ratio mass spectrometry (ID-GC-C-IRMS) was good.  The ninth participant used a headspace GC-FID method that had not been validated in an earlier pilot study (CCQM-P35).</p>
    <p>A follow-on Key Comparison, CCQM-K27-Subsequent, was initiated in 2003 to accommodate laboratories that had not been ready to benchmark their methods in the original CCQM-K27 study or that wished to benchmark a different method.  Four levels of ethanol in water were used in the subsequent study (nominal concentrations of 0.2 mg/g, 1 mg/g, 3 mg/g, and 60 mg/g).  The three participants in the CCQM-K27-Subsequent Key Comparison demonstrated their ability to measure ethanol in aqueous matrix in the concentration range of 0.2 mg/g to 60 mg/g.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the
    CCQM, according to the provisions of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
