abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)
    recommends the use of a first-order Taylor series expansion for propagating errors
    and uncertainties. The GUM also endorses the use of ‘other analytical or numerical
    methods’ when the conditions for using the Taylor expansion do not apply. In this
    paper we propose an alternative approach for evaluating measurement uncertainty
    based on the principle of generalized inference. The proposed approach can be
    applied to measurement models having any number of input quantities and a vector-valued
    measurand. We use several examples from the GUM to illustrate the implementation
    of the proposed approach for the calculation of uncertainties in measurement results.</p>"
