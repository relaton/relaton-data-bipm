abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a linearity tester for optical detectors, which is based
    on the flux-addition method using two high-brightness light emitting diodes (LEDs)
    as the light source. The tester is operated with a novel data-acquisition algorithm
    that determines the switching and data-reading sequence for eliminating the measurement
    error caused by a drift of the LED radiant flux. Linearity measurement with an
    uncertainty of as low as 10<sup>âˆ’4</sup> in a dynamic range over six decades is
    experimentally demonstrated with simple setup, short measurement time and fully
    automated operation.</p>"
