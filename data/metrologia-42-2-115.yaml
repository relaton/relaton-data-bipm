abstract:
- content: "<p>Machining the surface of mass standards is still of great importance.
    This paper details a comparative study of the roughness of two plane surfaces
    of a platinum–iridium alloy (90% of platinum and 10% of iridium). Using the BIPM
    processes, the surfaces were initially machined on a lathe using diamond tools;
    in addition, one of these was manually polished with a diamond paste.</p><p>Three
    techniques for surface characterization are used: shear-force microscopy (ShFM),
    optical roughness-meter and x-ray reflectometer. The first technique uses the
    shear-force interaction between the probe and the sample. The ShFM is part of
    a scanning near-field optical microscope that has the advantage of providing two
    images simultaneously, a topographical one and a near-field optical one. Only
    the topographic images will be presented in this paper; the results obtained in
    optical near-field will be the subject of another publication. To avoid any confusion,
    we will speak here of ShFM. The topographic images and their associated statistical
    and physical parameters, such as power spectral densities (PSDs), root-mean-square
    height, etc, are discussed in this paper. The PSDs of the surface are also determined
    experimentally from x-ray and visible light scattering measurements using angle-resolved
    scattering theory. This theory, which is well adapted for visible radiation, is
    extended to x-rays. The measurements made with the three instruments demonstrate
    that the two surfaces present a roughness of the same order of magnitude. However,
    the defects that contribute in a preponderant manner to their roughness spectrum
    do not belong to the same spatial bandwidth but depend on the polishing process.</p>"
