abstract:
- content: "<p>The fine structure constant, α, is shown to be proportional to the
    ratio of the quanta of electric and magnetic force associated with the electron.
    This provides a new representation, which is global across all unit systems. Consequently,
    a variation in α was shown to occur due to a differential change in the fraction
    of the quanta of electric and magnetic force, while a variation in ℏc was shown
    to manifest due to the common mode change. The representation is discussed with
    respect to the running of the fine structure constant at high energies (small
    distances), and a putative temporal drift. It is shown that the running of the
    fine structure constant is due to equal components of electric screening (polarization
    of vacuum) and magnetic anti-screening (magnetization of vacuum), which cause
    the perceived quantum of electric charge to increase at small distances, while
    the magnetic flux quantum decreases. This introduces the concept of the ‘bare
    magnetic flux quanta’ as well as the ‘bare electric charge’. With regard to temporal
    drift, it is confirmed that it is impossible to determine which fundamental constant
    is varying if α varies.</p>"
