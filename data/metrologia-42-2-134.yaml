abstract:
- content: "<p>The portable Quality Assurance of Spectral UV Measurements in Europe
    (QASUME) irradiance scale has been directly compared to the primary irradiance
    standard (blackbody BB3200pg) of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
    using the travelling spectroradiometer QASUME. The average blackbody spectral
    irradiance scale based on three different temperatures (2940 K, 2997 K and 3059 K)
    was on average 0.7% greater than the QASUME irradiance scale based on the average
    of three low-power lamps. This is fully consistent with the expanded uncertainty
    (k = 2) of 4% in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range and 2.6% above 400 nm of
    the QASUME irradiance scale. If these blackbody measurements are used to establish
    directly the portable QASUME irradiance scale, then its expanded uncertainty (k
    = 2) is substantially reduced to 2.5% in the UV and 2.0% above 400 nm.</p>"
