abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Some formulae used for evaluation of the uncertainties of the degree
    of equivalence between laboratories participating in an international comparison
    of activity measurement are presented. Two approaches are considered using two
    different estimators for the key comparison reference value: the arithmetic mean
    and the weighted mean. For each approach, four cases which can be encountered
    when dealing with comparison data are detailed. Finally, the effect of the uncertainties
    on the weights used in the second approach is also considered. This work has been
    developed for analysis of results of comparisons organized in the field of ionizing
    radiations, but the formulae are sufficiently general to allow their use for other
    comparisons. However, correlations between results have not been considered.</p>"
