abstract:
- content: "<p>It is well known that the response of semiconductor photodetectors
    depends on the state of polarization of the incident light. The magnitude of this
    effect is quantified as the logarithm of the ratio of the maximum and minimum
    values of the responsivity when the detector is illuminated with completely polarized
    radiation of different polarization states. It will be referred to as polarization-dependent
    responsivity (PDR) (defined in analogy to polarization-dependent loss).</p><p>A
    first set-up was developed to measure the average PDR of several germanium (Ge)
    and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodetectors between 1510 nm and 1610 nm,
    using a polarization scrambler. It has been observed that Ge and InGaAs photodetectors
    are sensitive to polarization, and that the magnitude depends on wavelength. It
    is shown that the PDR increases dramatically at wavelengths beyond the responsivity
    peak: this effect is especially strong for Ge, which has its peak near 1550 nm
    at room temperature, whose PDR is ⩽ 0.005 dB at 1550 nm and 23 °C, while it increases
    to 0.05 dB at the same wavelength when the detector is cooled to −10 °C.</p><p>A
    second set-up was developed to measure the response of photodetectors to four
    main states of polarization at a grid of points on the active area with a small
    collimated beam, which is moved over the detector's surface using a motorized
    translation stage. With the power measured at each polarization state, we propose
    an adaptation of the Mueller matrix that allows us to obtain the first row of
    this matrix, so as to calculate the polarization axis vector for each point measured
    on the photodetector. Results lead us to suspect the existence of a polarization
    axis in photodetectors.</p>"
