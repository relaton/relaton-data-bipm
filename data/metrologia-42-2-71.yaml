abstract:
- content: "<p>The kilogram, the base unit of mass in the International System of
    Units (SI), is defined as the mass \n of the international prototype of the kilogram.
    Clearly, this definition has the effect of fixing the value of \n to be one kilogram
    exactly. In this paper, we review the benefits that would accrue if the kilogram
    were redefined so as to fix the value of either the Planck constant h or the Avogadro
    constant N<sub>A</sub> instead of, without waiting for the experiments to determine
    h or N<sub>A</sub> currently underway to reach their desired relative standard
    uncertainty of about 10<sup>−8</sup>. A significant reduction in the uncertainties
    of the SI values of many other fundamental constants would result from either
    of these new definitions, at the expense of making the mass \n of the international
    prototype a quantity whose value would have to be determined by experiment. However,
    by assigning a conventional value to, the present highly precise worldwide uniformity
    of mass standards could still be retained. The advantages of redefining the kilogram
    immediately outweigh any apparent disadvantages, and we review the alternative
    forms that a new definition might take.</p>"
