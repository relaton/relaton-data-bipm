abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The kilogram, the base unit of mass in the International System of
    Units (SI), is defined as the mass \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro193846in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    of the international prototype of the kilogram. Clearly, this definition has the
    effect of fixing the value of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro193846in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    to be one kilogram exactly. In this paper, we review the benefits that would accrue
    if the kilogram were redefined so as to fix the value of either the Planck constant
    <italic>h</italic> or the Avogadro constant <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> instead
    of <inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro193846in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>, without
    waiting for the experiments to determine <italic>h</italic> or <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>
    currently underway to reach their desired relative standard uncertainty of about
    10<sup>−8</sup>. A significant reduction in the uncertainties of the SI values
    of many other fundamental constants would result from either of these new definitions,
    at the expense of making the mass \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro193846in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    of the international prototype a quantity whose value would have to be determined
    by experiment. However, by assigning a conventional value to \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro193846in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>, the present highly precise
    worldwide uniformity of mass standards could still be retained. The advantages
    of redefining the kilogram immediately outweigh any apparent disadvantages, and
    we review the alternative forms that a new definition might take.</p>"
