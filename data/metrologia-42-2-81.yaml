abstract:
- content: "<p>The radiometric quantities that qualitatively characterize optical
    radiation are considered. The argument of the function whose value is the radiometric
    quantity contains not only variables, but sets as well. Differential and integral
    correlations connecting functions for two different radiometric quantities are
    based on the concepts of set function derivative with respect to set measure and
    of the indefinite Lebesgue integral.</p>"
