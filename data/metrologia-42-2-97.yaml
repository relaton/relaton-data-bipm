abstract:
- content: "<p>Panel or jury testing is a widely used technique in the measurement
    of quantities related to human perception. However, despite both scientific and
    applied interests, the confidence of potential users of this technique is less
    than in more familiar physical and engineering measurements. This lack of confidence
    arises mainly due to the lack of standardization and of internationally recognized
    metrological references for panel testing.</p><p>Here we discuss some methodological
    aspects of panel testing, including the construction of the reference scale, the
    definition and realization of a measuring system based on a previously established
    scale, its calibration and related uncertainty evaluation. We provide illustrative
    examples concerning the measurement of the quality of sound (acceptability) of
    machinery used for the automatic sorting of post, presenting experimental results
    from tests performed in our laboratory, which seem encouraging.</p><p>Finally,
    we propose some possible actions for standardization and for the promotion of
    a metrological approach.</p>"
