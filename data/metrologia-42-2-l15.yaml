abstract:
- content: "<p>By international accord, the standard uncertainty of a directly measured
    quantity is taken as the square root of the variance of its probability density
    function (pdf). The pdf can be inferred from the dispersion of unbiased observations
    obtained by repeatedly measuring the quantity involved. If the quantity is not
    repeatedly measured, the apparent scarcity of experimental data may require consideration
    of information other than experimental data to assign the pdf and to evaluate
    the uncertainty; in this context, an evaluator tends intuitively to consider information
    linked with his experience. In this work, we report on a method, based on the
    theorem of Bayes, to assign the pdf and to evaluate the uncertainty of a quantity
    measured only once. This method allows us to include in the uncertainty evaluation
    the information concerning the evaluator's experience. It gives theoretical support
    to the intuition since it satisfies the formalities of statistical inference.
    Two examples are presented.</p>"
