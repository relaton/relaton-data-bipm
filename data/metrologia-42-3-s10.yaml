  content: "<p>When the reference of a unit is changed, the task remains of expressing
    the new definition in the terms of the previous one. In two centuries, for instance,
    the definition of the metre was changed six times. Around 1955, the definitions
    of the second as the SI unit of time were changed from astronomical ones, based
    on the rotation (or revolution) of the Earth, to a definition stemming from a
    quantum phenomenon. The expression of the new atomic second in terms of the previous
    definitions required a number of actions and measurements. The aim of this paper
    is to review these actions, some of which, fifty years later, are being forgotten
    for a lack of adequate documentation.</p>"
