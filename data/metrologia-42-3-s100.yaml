abstract:
- content: "<p>Using microfabrication processes, we have been able to construct physics
    packages for vapour cell atomic frequency references 100× smaller than previously
    existing versions, with a corresponding reduction in power consumption. In addition,
    the devices offer the potential for wafer-level fabrication and assembly, which
    would substantially reduce manufacturing costs. It is anticipated that a complete
    frequency reference could be constructed based on these physics packages with
    a total volume below 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, a power dissipation near 30 mW and a fractional
    frequency instability below 10<sup>−11</sup> over time periods from hours to days.
    Such a device would enable the use of atomically precise timing in applications
    that require battery operation and portability, such as hand-held global positioning
    system receivers and wireless communication systems.</p>"
