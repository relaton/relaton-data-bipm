  content: "<p>Surprising as it might seem, it is possible to phase-coherently track,
    synthesize, count and divide optical frequencies of visible laser sources. In
    essence, the technologies described here now allow direct connection of basically
    any frequency from DC to 1000 THz. Modern ‘self-referenced’ femtosecond mode-locked
    lasers have enormously simplified the required technology. These revolutionary
    new systems build on a long history of optical frequency metrology that spans
    from the early days of the laser. The latest systems rely heavily on technologies
    previously developed for laser frequency stabilization, optical phase-locked-loops,
    nonlinear mixing, ultra-fast optics and precision opto-electronic metrology. Using
    examples we summarize some of the heroic efforts that led to the successful development
    of harmonic optical frequency chains. Those systems played critical roles in defining
    the speed of light and in redefining the metre. We then describe the present state-of-the-art
    technology in femtosecond laser frequency combs, their extraordinary performance
    capabilities and some of the latest results.</p>"
