  content: "<p>The evolution of atomic frequency standards since Essen's atomic clock
    fifty years ago has been considerable both in respect of microwave and optical
    standards. In particular, the development of trapping and laser cooling techniques
    for both atoms and ions has played a major role. This paper reviews the status
    of the development of single cold trapped ion and cold trapped atom optical frequency
    standards. Recent results show comb measurements of trapped ion optical frequency
    standards with accuracies close to Cs fountain limited operation. The factors
    affecting future stability and reproducibility are discussed. The opportunities
    for future standards capable of approaching reproducibility at the 10<sup>âˆ’18</sup>
    level are outlined, together with the likely limitations arising.</p>"
