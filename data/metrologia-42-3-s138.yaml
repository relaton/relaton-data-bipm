  content: "<p>Soon after the advent of atomic clocks 50 years ago, their unprecedented
    uncertainties and their widespread use required that the definition of time scales
    and clock comparison procedures be considered rigorously within the theoretical
    framework of general relativity. We review the present procedures and show that
    the current relativistic modelling is adequate for the need of clocks and time
    transfer techniques. Accounting for the expected improvements in clock and time
    transfer technology, we investigate some possible implications in relation to
    the relativistic models.</p>"
