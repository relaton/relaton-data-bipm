abstract:
- content: "<p>The traditional applications of clocks and oscillators in navigation
    and scientific research continue to grow as new and more widespread applications
    emerge. Today, clocks and oscillators regulate the speed and efficiency of virtually
    every human endeavour ranging from the mundane to the exotic. In this paper we
    discuss some of the applications that require the service of high performance
    clocks and oscillators. In particular, we discuss space applications of clocks
    for navigation and scientific experiments. We also present a discussion of satellite
    navigation systems, especially the Global Positioning System, and comment on time
    dissemination over the Internet.</p>"
