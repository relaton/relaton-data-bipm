abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>This paper summarizes the creation and technical evolution of atomic
    time scales, recalling the parallel development of their acceptance and the remaining
    problems. We consider a consequence of the accuracy of time measurement, i.e.
    the entry of Einstein's general relativity into metrology and its applications.
    We give some details about the method of calculation and the characteristics of
    International Atomic Time, and we show how it is disseminated at the ultimate
    level of precision.</p>"
