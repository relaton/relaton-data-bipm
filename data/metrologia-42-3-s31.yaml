abstract:
- content: "<p>The caesium beam frequency standard using the separated oscillatory
    field technique proposed by Ramsey in 1950 has seen intensive development over
    the last fifty years. Its practical implementation as a primary time standard
    made possible the realization of the second with a precision better than that
    obtained by means of astronomical measurements and provided the basis for its
    redefinition in terms of atomic properties in 1967. This paper describes the basic
    principles underlying the operation of such atomic standards, reviews the progress
    made during the last fifty years since its invention, and provides an update on
    the state-of-the-art accuracy and frequency stability achieved today in this field.</p>"
