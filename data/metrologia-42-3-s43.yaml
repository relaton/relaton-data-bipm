  content: "<p>The primary clocks CS1 and CS2 have been developed and operated by
    the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig, Germany. By their contributions
    to the definition of the scale unit of International Atomic Time they have provided
    access to the realization of the SI second over decades with exceptional accuracy.
    They have stood out against other primary clocks by the novelty of their design
    concept, their robustness of construction and last but not the least by their
    almost continuous operation for many years. Their properties have changed with
    time, but during the last 7 years their uncertainty, <italic>u</italic><sub>B</sub>,
    has been estimated as 8 × 10<sup>−15</sup> (CS1) and 12 × 10<sup>−15</sup> (CS2).
    Comparisons with PTB's cold-atom frequency standard CSF1 (<italic>u</italic><sub>B</sub>
    = 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup>) over 3.5 years revealed that CS2 and CSF1 agreed well
    within the uncertainty <italic>u</italic><sub>B</sub>(CS2), whereas CS1 frequency
    deviates slightly more from CSF1 than <italic>u</italic><sub>B</sub>(CS1).</p>"
