  content: "<p>Time metrology in Russia in the second half of the twentieth century
    has been marked, as in other advanced countries, by the rapid development of time
    and frequency quantum standards and the beginning of atomic time-keeping. This
    brief review presents the main developments and studies in time and frequency
    measurement, and the improvement of accuracy and atomic time-keeping at the VNIIFTRI—the
    National Metrology Institute keeping primary time and frequency standards and
    ensuring unification of measurement. The milestones along the way have been the
    ammonia and hydrogen masers, primary caesium beam and fountain standards and laser
    frequency standards. For many years, VNIIFTRI was the only world laboratory that
    applied hydrogen-maser clock ensembles for time-keeping. VNIIFTRI's work on international
    laser standard frequency comparisons and absolute frequency measurements contributed
    greatly to the adoption by the CIPM of a highly accurate value for the He–Ne/CH<sub>4</sub>
    laser frequency. VNIIFTRI and the VNIIM were the first to establish a united time,
    frequency and length standard.</p>"
