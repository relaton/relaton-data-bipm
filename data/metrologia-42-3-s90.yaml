abstract:
- content: "<p>The first commercial caesium-beam clock was the Atomichron, developed
    by National Company. The first unit was delivered in 1956. This paper first presents
    a brief history of commercial caesium-beam clocks. It then covers many of the
    sources of frequency error and frequency instability. Some details of the technical
    design of the caesium-tube and electronics are presented. Finally, we present
    some possible directions for future commercial caesium clocks.</p>"
