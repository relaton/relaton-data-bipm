abstract:
- content: "<p>The definition of the International Temperature Scale, ITS-90, requires
    the substances used for the realization of the fixed-points, except<sup>3</sup>He,
    to be of ‘natural’ isotopic composition. The uncertainty of the best fixed-point
    realizations for some of these substances is today significantly affected by the
    natural variability of the isotopic composition of the available samples. The
    paper discusses the main implications of this problem, which is becoming an obstacle
    to further improvements for some of the fixed-point realizations. In addition,
    the two main solutions are compared: (i) to define only a reference composition
    and (ii) to define a reference composition and allow the use of a correction for
    the deviations from a reference composition.</p>"
