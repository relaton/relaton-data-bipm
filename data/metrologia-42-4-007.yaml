abstract:
- content: "<p>For an accurate assessment of the f′<sub>1</sub> value of a photometer
    head it is important to determine the maximum step size for sampling and an appropriate
    bandwidth of the monochromator for an acceptable uncertainty contribution. A simulation
    is carried out to evaluate these uncertainty contributions for fine photometer
    heads, with a mismatch characteristic f′ ⩽ 3% and uncertainty contributions f′
    ⩽ 0.1 % taken as the limits for acceptance. Assuming a stable measurement set-up,
    the results show that a 5 nm step size and a 5 nm bandwidth or less are needed
    for this assessment. The uncertainty of the f′<sub>1</sub> value caused by the
    wavelength uncertainty of the monochromator is analysed additionally. For extended
    bandwidths a method is proposed to correct the spectral responsivity data of the
    photometer head and reduce the bandpass uncertainty contribution effectively.</p>"
