abstract:
- content: "<p>Within an international collaboration of the eight metrological institutes
    represented by the authors, the dependence of the triple-point temperature of
    equilibrium hydrogen on the deuterium content at low concentrations has been precisely
    determined so that the uncertainty in realizing the triple point as a temperature
    fixed point might be reduced by nearly one order of magnitude. To investigate
    the thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen–deuterium mixtures and to elucidate
    the factors that influence the melting temperature, 28 sealed fixed-point cells
    have been filled and measured, and some of these have been compared with an open-cell
    system. Hydrogen gas with a deuterium content ranging from 27.2 µmol D/mol H to
    154.9 µmol D/mol H was studied using cells containing five different types of
    spin-conversion catalyst, with different catalyst-to-liquid volume ratios (a few
    per cent to more than 100%) and of different designs. The latter consideration
    is especially influential in determining the thermal behaviour of the cells and,
    thus, the temperature-measurement errors. The cells were measured at the eight
    participating institutes in accordance with a detailed protocol that facilitates
    a direct comparison of the results. Through analysis of the measurements, significant
    inter-institute deviations due to different measurement facilities and methods
    have been ruled out with respect to the determination of both the melting temperatures
    and the thermal parameters of the cells. The uncertainty estimates for the determination
    of the deuterium content have been verified by including isotopic analysis results
    from four different sources. The slope of the dependence of the triple-point temperature
    of equilibrium hydrogen isotopic mixtures on the deuterium content has been deduced
    from the melting temperatures of those sample portions not in direct contact with
    the catalysts. Evaluation of the data using different mathematical methods has
    yielded an average value of 5.4<sub>2</sub> µK per µmol D/mol H, with an upper
    bound of the standard uncertainty of 0.3<sub>1</sub> µK per µmol D/mol H. This
    is close to the literature value of 5.6 µK per µmol D/mol H that was obtained
    at higher deuterium concentrations.</p>"
