abstract:
- content: "<p>A vertical cobalt–carbon (Co–C) eutectic fixed point cell was constructed
    at PTB to demonstrate its use for improvement of the calibration of noble-metal
    thermocouples at temperatures above 1100 °C. The melting and freezing temperatures
    of the Co–C eutectic were measured in different high-temperature furnaces at PTB
    and INMETRO (Brazil) to show its stability by using a Pt/Pd thermocouple. The
    reproducibility of all measured electromotive forces at the inflection points
    of the melting curves amounts to a value of about 0.06 °C. No drift in the melting
    temperature was observed. Therefore, the Co–C eutectic fixed point cell can be
    used as an adequate transfer standard for dissemination of the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) in the temperature range above the freezing point of copper.</p>"
