abstract:
- content: "<p>We measured gas adsorption on native oxides formed on Si(100), Si(111)
    and Si(110) surfaces and found that the dependence of the gas adsorption on the
    surface orientation was insignificant. This fact suggests that the atomic structure
    of SiO<sub>2</sub> near the top surface is almost amorphous. For the physical
    adsorption of water vapour, we obtained a monolayer capacity of 0.0040 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>
    and a BET parameter of 4.5, which corresponds to 0.0065 µg cm<sup>−2</sup> water
    vapour adsorption at 50% humidity with an uncertainty of 0.0005 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>
    (k = 1). Thus, it can be concluded that the physical adsorption of water on a
    defect-free surface of a 1 kg silicon sphere amounts to 1.8 µg with an uncertainty
    of 0.14 µg (k = 1) at 50% humidity. In addition, measurement using ethanol vapour
    and n-octane vapour showed that gas adsorption decreased after hydroxylation of
    SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si surfaces.</p>"
