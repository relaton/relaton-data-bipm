  content: "<p>We review the development and status of GPS geodetic methods for high-precision
    global time and frequency comparisons. A comprehensive view is taken, including
    hardware effects in the transmitting satellites and tracking receiver stations,
    data analysis and interpretation, and comparisons with independent results. Other
    GPS techniques rely on single-frequency data and/or assume cancellation of most
    systematic errors using differences between simultaneous observations. By applying
    the full observation modelling of modern geodesy to dual-frequency observations
    of GPS carrier phase and pseudorange, the precision of timing comparisons can
    be improved from the level of several nanoseconds to near 100 ps. For an averaging
    interval of one day, we infer a limiting Allan deviation of about 1.4 × 10<sup>−15</sup>
    for the GPS geodetic technique. The accuracy of time comparisons is set by the
    ability to calibrate the absolute instrumental delays through the GPS receiver
    and antenna chain, currently about 3 ns. Geodetic clock measurements are available
    for most of the major timing laboratories, as well as for many other tracking
    stations and the satellites, via the routine products of the International GPS
    Service.</p>"
