  content: "<p>As part of the research activity carried on at the Institute of Metrology
    ‘G Colonnetti’ IMGC-CNR in Turin on the development of the IMGC02 absolute gravimeter,
    a method to estimate the time occurrences of interference fringes was developed
    and tested. The capabilities of the IMGC02 have been enhanced by: increased flexibility
    in timing measurement, the possibility of real-time analysis and the removal of
    frequency-dependent time delays introduced by the timing electronics. A Monte
    Carlo simulation has shown, in the case of an ideal frequency and length reference,
    that the resolution of the waveform digitizer that samples the interference signal
    can limit the accuracy of the timing measurement. Nevertheless, the expected systematic
    bias in the absolute measurement of the acceleration due to gravity, <italic>g</italic>,
    introduced by this data processing technique is negligible when compared to the
    current instrument uncertainty.</p>"
