  content: "<p>For an accurate assessment of the <italic>f</italic>′<sub>1</sub> value
    of a photometer head it is important to determine the maximum step size for sampling
    and an appropriate bandwidth of the monochromator for an acceptable uncertainty
    contribution. A simulation is carried out to evaluate these uncertainty contributions
    for fine photometer heads, with a mismatch characteristic <italic>f</italic>′
    ⩽ 3% and uncertainty contributions <italic>f</italic>′ ⩽ 0.1 % taken as the limits
    for acceptance. Assuming a stable measurement set-up, the results show that a
    5 nm step size and a 5 nm bandwidth or less are needed for this assessment. The
    uncertainty of the <italic>f</italic>′<sub>1</sub> value caused by the wavelength
    uncertainty of the monochromator is analysed additionally. For extended bandwidths
    a method is proposed to correct the spectral responsivity data of the photometer
    head and reduce the bandpass uncertainty contribution effectively.</p>"
