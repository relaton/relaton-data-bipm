  content: "<p>The use of special units for logarithmic ratio quantities is reviewed.
    The neper is used with a natural logarithm (logarithm to the base e) to express
    the logarithm of the amplitude ratio of two pure sinusoidal signals, particularly
    in the context of linear systems where it is desired to represent the gain or
    loss in amplitude of a single-frequency signal between the input and output. The
    bel, and its more commonly used submultiple, the decibel, are used with a decadic
    logarithm (logarithm to the base 10) to measure the ratio of two power-like quantities,
    such as a mean square signal or a mean square sound pressure in acoustics. Thus
    two distinctly different quantities are involved. In this review we define the
    quantities first, without reference to the units, as is standard practice in any
    system of quantities and units. We show that two different definitions of the
    quantity power level, or logarithmic power ratio, are possible. We show that this
    leads to two different interpretations for the meaning and numerical values of
    the units bel and decibel. We review the question of which of these alternative
    definitions is actually used, or is used by implication, by workers in the field.
    Finally, we discuss the relative advantages of the alternative definitions.</p>"
