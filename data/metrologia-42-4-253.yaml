abstract:
- content: "<p>We examine chi-squared statistics that are appropriate for analysing
    the adequacy of different key comparison reference value (KCRV) candidates in
    accounting for the observed dispersion of results of a key comparison, about the
    candidate estimator and within the stated uncertainty claims. We extend the analysis
    to cover cases where the uncertainty budgets incorporate low degrees of freedom
    or have significant correlations. In this context, we discuss when it is important
    to view the KCRV as a method and not merely as a number. To use these statistics
    for the usual chi-squared tests of consistency, the required distributions (that
    can depart from the exact chi-squared distribution) can readily be evaluated by
    Monte Carlo simulation, for any KCRV algorithm that uses only the peer results
    of the comparison. Similarly, the effects of non-Gaussian distributions (such
    as the Student distribution implied when a participant has reported finite degrees
    of freedom) can be evaluated with the requisite precision.</p>"
