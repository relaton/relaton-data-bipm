abstract:
- content: "<p>When a current-to-voltage (I/V) converter is used with a photodetector,
    the ratio of the photodetector impedance (shunt impedance) to the input impedance
    of the detection circuit defines the ratio of the photogenerated current that
    will produce the output voltage. Ideally, the input impedance should be negligible
    in comparison with the shunt impedance as only in this case will the whole photogenerated
    current produce the output signal. With high quality, high band gap detectors
    in most of the cases this requirement is automatically met, but if lower band
    gap detectors are used this requirement may not be satisfied.</p><p>The input
    impedance increases linearly with increasing feedback impedance of the I/V converter;
    i.e. at a sufficiently high feedback impedance value the output signal will deviate
    from the ideal case—it will be lower. Since the measurement of low intensity radiation
    requires a high feedback impedance, the lower the irradiance value on the detector
    the higher this deviation will be. If all the parameters of the detection system
    are kept constant during a measurement series, only calibration is required to
    achieve low uncertainty, but if any of the impedances or the gain of the operational
    amplifier changes during a measurement series this will result in increased measurement
    error. It should be noted that the values of these impedances can change rapidly
    with temperature. By applying a bootstrap circuit to the detector the impedance
    of the bootstrapped detector—depending on the frequency of the operation—will
    be 3–6 decades higher, compared with the detector alone; i.e. bootstrapping virtually
    increases the impedance of the detector. Consequently, this error will appear
    only at a much higher sensitivity range, greatly reducing this problem. Here we
    analyse the bootstrap solution.</p>"
