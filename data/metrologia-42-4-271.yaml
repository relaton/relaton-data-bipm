abstract:
- content: "<p>The parametric down conversion of photons generated in a non-linear
    crystal gives rise to two correlated photons. When associated with a system of
    coincidence counting, this phenomenon allows one to measure the quantum efficiencies
    of detectors working at a normal rate of photon counting, without the need for
    reference sources or detectors. At the Institut National de MÃ©trologie (INM) (France),
    this method was implemented with the aim of developing a new standard detector
    for the absolute measurement of very weak radiation. The validation of this method
    is presented from an international comparison between the laboratories of the
    INM (France) and the Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale Galileo Ferraris (IENGF)
    (Italy) and from a comparison of methods at INM using the French national standard
    detector, the cryogenic radiometer.</p>"
