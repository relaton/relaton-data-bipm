  content: "<p>The triple point of xenon is shown to be a suitable fixed point for
    incorporation into the next revision of the International Temperature Scale (ITS)
    as a means of reducing the non-uniqueness in the important 84 K to 273 K range.
    Isotopic effects, once thought to be a limiting factor, are shown to be negligible.
    Purity remains the overriding concern, but high-purity xenon gas is obtainable,
    giving a very flat plateau with a melting range within ±10 µK from 50% to 90%
    of the melted sample fraction. The triple point temperature of xenon is shown
    to be 161.405 96 K ± 0.32 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 1) on the ITS-90. The propagated
    calibration uncertainty of the platinum resistance thermometers and the component
    attributed to the non-uniqueness of the ITS-90, as evidenced by the differences
    among the seven calibrated thermometers, dominate the overall uncertainty of the
    estimated triple point temperature. The xenon triple point itself is highly reproducible,
    with a standard deviation of 48 µK for the eight melts of this study and a total
    realization uncertainty of just 76 µK.</p>"
