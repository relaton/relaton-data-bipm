  content: "<p>To reduce the uncertainties in measurements obtained by means of capillary
    viscometers, we developed an absolute falling-ball viscometer. The metrological
    characterization of this experimental bench is presented for a mineral oil with
    a viscosity of 30 Pa s by means of two distinct methods described in the GUM (<italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>). First, the calculation
    is performed using the law of propagation of uncertainties. Then, because of the
    increasing use of the techniques of propagation of distributions in metrology,
    we calculated the measurement uncertainties by a numerical Monte Carlo simulation.
    Both results were then compared for a confidence interval of 95%. Finally, the
    viscosity measurements and uncertainties obtained by the falling-ball viscometer
    were compared against those obtained by a capillary viscometer.</p>"
