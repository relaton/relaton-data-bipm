abstract:
- content: "<p>To reduce the uncertainties in measurements obtained by means of capillary
    viscometers, we developed an absolute falling-ball viscometer. The metrological
    characterization of this experimental bench is presented for a mineral oil with
    a viscosity of 30 Pa s by means of two distinct methods described in the GUM (Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement). First, the calculation is performed
    using the law of propagation of uncertainties. Then, because of the increasing
    use of the techniques of propagation of distributions in metrology, we calculated
    the measurement uncertainties by a numerical Monte Carlo simulation. Both results
    were then compared for a confidence interval of 95%. Finally, the viscosity measurements
    and uncertainties obtained by the falling-ball viscometer were compared against
    those obtained by a capillary viscometer.</p>"
