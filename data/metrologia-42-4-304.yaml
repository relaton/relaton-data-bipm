  content: "<p>We demonstrate a simplified set-up for control of the carrier-envelope
    offset frequency (<italic>f</italic><sub>ceo</sub>) in a Ti : sapphire femtosecond
    laser frequency comb. A periodically poled KTiOPO<sub>4</sub> crystal is used
    for second harmonic generation with zero walk-off angle, which enables collinear
    propagation of beating beams in the self-referencing set-up. A beat signal with
    a signal-to-noise ratio of more than 40 dB can be obtained within a 300 kHz bandwidth.
    Using this signal, <italic>f</italic><sub>ceo</sub> could be tracked to a frequency
    synthesizer within a few millihertz for an averaging time of 1 s, which contributed
    a relative stability of 8 × 10<sup>−18</sup> in the visible region around 532 nm.</p>"
