abstract:
- content: "<p>We demonstrate a simplified set-up for control of the carrier-envelope
    offset frequency (f<sub>ceo</sub>) in a Ti : sapphire femtosecond laser frequency
    comb. A periodically poled KTiOPO<sub>4</sub> crystal is used for second harmonic
    generation with zero walk-off angle, which enables collinear propagation of beating
    beams in the self-referencing set-up. A beat signal with a signal-to-noise ratio
    of more than 40 dB can be obtained within a 300 kHz bandwidth. Using this signal,
    f<sub>ceo</sub> could be tracked to a frequency synthesizer within a few millihertz
    for an averaging time of 1 s, which contributed a relative stability of 8 × 10<sup>−18</sup>
    in the visible region around 532 nm.</p>"
