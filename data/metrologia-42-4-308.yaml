abstract:
- content: "<p>We present an ultra-precise flotation method (±0.1 ppm at 99% level-of-confidence)
    for density-of-water comparisons close to its temperature of maximum density.
    The method consists of observing two equilibrium temperatures of the given silica
    float: below and above the maximum density point. Discussion of measurement sensitivity
    and results for various water samples are given.</p>"
