  content: "<p>In 2003, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM)
    recommended updated values of the frequency for certain optical frequency standards
    recommended for the practical realization of the definition of the metre. The
    text of this CIPM Recommendation and details of the updated radiations are given
    here. The complete updated set of recommended radiations, including frequencies,
    wavelengths, uncertainties and operating conditions where appropriate, is available
    on the BIPM website.</p>"
