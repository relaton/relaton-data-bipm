abstract:
- content: "<p>The term dimension is difficult, if not impossible, to define in any
    meaningful way, which raises doubts about the usefulness of the concept, even
    though it is widely used. This essay examines the significance of a statement
    of the dimension of a quantity and concludes that it is minimal and possibly misleading.</p>"
