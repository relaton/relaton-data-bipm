abstract:
- content: "<p>Values of plane angles are expressed with a choice of several units.
    Historically the quantity needed a unit because it was, and still is, used as
    a base quantity. ISO/TC 12 defines it as a derived, dimensionless quantity, and
    the International System of Units (SI) gives it the ‘dimensionless unit’ radian,
    which now means no more than ‘one’. This paper discusses the confusion that arises
    from the dual uses of these terms.</p><p>The author argues that solid angle is
    logically a two-dimensional angle derived from plane angle, and has units naturally
    derived from units of plane angle. ISO/TC 12, however, defines the quantity independently
    of plane angle as a dimensionless quantity to which, nevertheless, the SI assigns
    a ‘unit’.</p>"
