    <p>Values of plane angles are expressed with a choice of several units. Historically the quantity needed a unit because it was, and still is, used as a base quantity. ISO/TC 12 defines it as a derived, dimensionless quantity, and the International System of Units (SI) gives it the ‘dimensionless unit’ radian, which now means no more than ‘one’. This paper discusses the confusion that arises from the dual uses of these terms.</p>
    <p>The author argues that solid angle is logically a two-dimensional angle derived from plane angle, and has units naturally derived from units of plane angle. ISO/TC 12, however, defines the quantity independently of plane angle as a dimensionless quantity to which, nevertheless, the SI assigns a ‘unit’.</p>
