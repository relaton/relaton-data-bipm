abstract:
- content: "<p>A practical, transparent and accurate procedure is proposed for the
    evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The procedure is based on established statistical
    theory, allows the treatment of correlated input quantities estimated from a finite
    number of observations and permits the assignment of asymmetric distributions
    to input quantities.</p><p>The procedure is applicable wherever the basic method
    of clause 8 of the  Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement  (the
    \ Guide ) is applicable. As in the method of the  Guide, distributions are associated
    with input quantities for use with a linearized formulation of the measurement
    function. These distributions are combined using a property of their statistical
    cumulants, which are simple functions of their moments. The distribution ultimately
    obtained for the measurand is a member of the Pearson family, which has the set
    of scaled  t -distributions as a subset. So the procedure allows greater flexibility
    than the method of the  Guide  in the representation of the distribution associated
    with the measurand.</p><p>The procedure has the qualities of internal consistency
    and transferability as outlined in clause 0.4 of the  Guide  and is consistent
    with principles of the ‘propagation of distributions’ that underlie a proposed
    supplement to the  Guide. In many cases it will permit the quotation of uncertainty
    intervals that are narrower than those of the  Guide  yet with the same justifiable
    probability of containing the measurand, so providing a more informative statement
    to the user of the interval. The procedure is presented for the probabilities
    of 0.95 and 0.99 but can be extended to accommodate other probabilities.</p>"
