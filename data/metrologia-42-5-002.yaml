abstract:
- content: "<p>In a manner different from the two-way satellite time and frequency
    transfer (TWSTFT) via geostationary satellites which has been employed for subnanosecond
    time transfer between widely separated earth stations, TWSTFT via non-geostationary
    satellites has a problem attaining subnanosecond accuracy because of satellite
    motion. The impact of satellite motion on the accuracy of TWSTFT via non-geostationary
    satellites is wholly attributed to the non-reciprocal geometric path. We have
    analysed the non-reciprocal geometric path caused by satellite motion in order
    to evaluate the accuracy of TWSTFT via non-geostationary satellites. Our analysis
    shows that the non-reciprocal geometric path introduces significant error to the
    accuracy of subnanosecond time transfer. Using a numerical model, we have demonstrated
    that ordinary orbit estimation can correct the non-reciprocal geometric path in
    TWSTFT via non-geostationary satellites to subnanosecond accuracy. Residuals of
    the non-reciprocal geometric path correction with respect to the orbit estimation
    accuracy and baseline length are presented. As an example of a non-geostationary
    satellite orbit, we employed an orbit of a quasi-zenith satellite orbiting the
    Earth in a period of one day, in synchronization with the Earth's rotation and
    with an orbital inclination of 45Â°.</p>"
