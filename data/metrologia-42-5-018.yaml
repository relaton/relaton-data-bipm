abstract:
- content: "<p>A pair of diode laser frequency standards stabilized to 778 nm two-photon
    rubidium transitions have been developed and characterized. Their sensitivity
    to vapour pressure, modulation depth and optical power have been investigated,
    along with their relative stability and day-to-day reproducibility. The Allan
    deviation of the standards locked to the 5 <sup>2</sup>S<sub>1/2</sub>(F<sub>g</sub>
    = 3)–5 <sup>2</sup>D<sub>5/2</sub>(F<sub>e</sub> = 5) transition of<sup>85</sup>Rb
    is 9.3 × 10<sup>−13</sup>τ<sup>−1/2</sup> for 1 s &lt; τ &lt; 100 s, reaching
    a floor of 1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> at 100 s. The long-term repeatability of an individual
    system locked to this line is 1.2 kHz, corresponding to 3.1 parts in 10<sup>12</sup>.
    The system-to-system reproducibility is limited by cell impurities to 4.9 kHz
    and 4.5 kHz, respectively, for this line and the 5 <sup>2</sup>S<sub>1/2</sub>(F<sub>g</sub>
    = 2)–5 <sup>2</sup>D<sub>5/2</sub>(F<sub>e</sub> = 4) transition in<sup>87</sup>Rb.
    The mean observed frequencies for these transitions, averaged for the two systems
    and corrected for light shift and second-order relativistic Doppler effect, are
    385 285 142 375.1 (4.9) kHz and 385 284 566 374.2 (4.5) kHz, respectively.</p>"
