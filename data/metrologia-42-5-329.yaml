    <p>A practical, transparent and accurate procedure is proposed for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The procedure is based on established statistical theory, allows the treatment of correlated input quantities estimated from a finite number of observations and permits the assignment of asymmetric distributions to input quantities.</p>
    <p>The procedure is applicable wherever the basic method of clause 8 of the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (the <italic>Guide</italic>) is applicable. As in the method of the <italic>Guide</italic>, distributions are associated with input quantities for use with a linearized formulation of the measurement function. These distributions are combined using a property of their statistical cumulants, which are simple functions of their moments. The distribution ultimately obtained for the measurand is a member of the Pearson family, which has the set of scaled <italic>t</italic>-distributions as a subset. So the procedure allows greater flexibility than the method of the <italic>Guide</italic> in the representation of the distribution associated with the measurand.</p>
    <p>The procedure has the qualities of internal consistency and transferability as outlined in clause 0.4 of the <italic>Guide</italic> and is consistent with principles of the ‘propagation of distributions’ that underlie a proposed supplement to the <italic>Guide</italic>. In many cases it will permit the quotation of uncertainty intervals that are narrower than those of the <italic>Guide</italic> yet with the same justifiable probability of containing the measurand, so providing a more informative statement to the user of the interval. The procedure is presented for the probabilities of 0.95 and 0.99 but can be extended to accommodate other probabilities.</p>
