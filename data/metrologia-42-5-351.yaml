abstract:
- content: "<p>In industrial applications, such as automated on-line semiconductor
    production, there is a growing realization of the need for the development of
    a procedure for periodic performance testing of the image sharpness of the scanning
    electron microscope. Two statistical and comparative measures of image sharpness
    based on the generalized variance and bivariate kurtosis of the spectral density
    for a two-dimensional stationary process are proposed.</p>"
