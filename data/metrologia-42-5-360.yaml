  content: "<p>The global sunlight method for the calibration of reference photovoltaic
    cells is described and illustrated with results from recent measurements. In this
    method, the short circuit current of the solar cell is recorded as it tracks the
    sun's position. This current, corrected for temperature and total irradiance deviation,
    is then plotted against pressure-corrected geometric air mass (AM). The calibration
    value (CV) at standard test conditions (25 °C, 1000 W m<sup>−2</sup> total irradiance
    with AM 1.5 spectral distribution) is extracted by a straight line fit to the
    data. The global sunlight method is less complex than other methods as it avoids
    (in particular conditions) the need for spectral irradiance measurements and corresponding
    relative spectral response determination. It has an estimated expanded uncertainty
    of 1% and agrees to better than 0.5% with the CVs of the World Photovoltaic Scale.</p>"
