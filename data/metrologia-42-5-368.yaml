  content: "<p>In general, research experimentation is often used mainly when new
    methodologies are being developed or existing ones are being improved. The characteristics
    of any method depend on its factors or components. The planning techniques and
    analysis of experiments are basically used to improve the analytical conditions
    of methods, to reduce experimental labour with the minimum of tests and to optimize
    the use of resources (reagents, time of analysis, availability of the equipment,
    operator time, etc). These techniques are applied by the identification of variables
    (control factors) of a process that have the most influence on the response of
    the parameters of interest, by attributing values to the influential variables
    of the process in order that the variability of response can be minimum, or the
    obtained value (quality parameter) be very close to the nominal value, and by
    attributing values to the influential variables of the process so that the effects
    of uncontrollable variables can be reduced. In this central composite design (CCD),
    four permanent modifiers (Pd, Ir, W and Rh) and one combined permanent modifier
    W+Ir were studied. The study selected two factors: pyrolysis and atomization temperatures
    at five different levels for all the possible combinations. The pyrolysis temperatures
    with different permanent modifiers varied from 600 °C to 1600 °C with hold times
    of 25 s, while atomization temperatures ranged between 1900 °C and 2280 °C. The
    characteristic masses for As were in the range of 31 pg to 81 pg. Assuming the
    best conditions obtained on CCD, it was possible to estimate the measurement uncertainty
    of As determination in water samples. The results showed that considering the
    main uncertainty sources such as the repetitivity of measurement inherent in the
    equipment, the calibration curve which evaluates the adjustment of the mathematical
    model to the results and the calibration standards concentrations, the values
    obtained were similar to international interlaboratorial comparison results.</p>"
