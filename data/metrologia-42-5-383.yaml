abstract:
- content: "<p>Calibrations of tungsten strip lamps are basically in terms of the
    temperature at a small central part of the filament. We calculate this temperature
    T<sub>m</sub>, which is dependent on the lamp current I, the temperature T<sub>e</sub>
    at the ends of the filament and the dimensions of the filament including the length
    L, by solving a heat balance equation. For a given filament with specific L and
    I, a slightly different T<sub>e</sub> results in a slightly different T<sub>m</sub>.
    From the results the change of T<sub>m</sub> relative to T<sub>e</sub>, dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>e</sub>
    is computed. Further results by varying L show that dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>e</sub>
    at a fixed T<sub>m</sub> always decreases with increasing L. For 62 mm ⩽ L ⩽ 104 mm
    and T<sub>e</sub> = 400 K, dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>e</sub> at T<sub>m</sub> = 1337 K
    decreases by a factor of approximately 2.5 for every 12 mm increase in L. Due
    to the diminishing amount of decrease there is little gain by increasing L beyond
    104 mm. Since T<sub>e</sub> is linked to the temperature T<sub>b</sub> of the
    lamp base, we expect dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>b</sub> to decrease similarly with
    increasing L. We measure dT<sub>λ</sub>/dT<sub>b</sub>, where T<sub>λ</sub> is
    the spectral radiance temperature at a wavelength λ of 650 nm and from which dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>b</sub>
    is deduced, of three tungsten strip lamps of the high-stability type for a filament
    of 62 mm length and two similar lamps of 74 mm filament length at a T<sub>b</sub>
    close to room temperature and 900 K ⩽ T<sub>m</sub> ⩽ 1600 K. Results show that
    dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>b</sub> of the longer filament is less than that of the
    shorter filament. It is beneficial to reduce dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>b</sub> by
    reducing dT<sub>m</sub>/dT<sub>e</sub> so that T<sub>m</sub>, and therefore the
    lamp calibration, is less dependent on the temperature of the lamp base. Our theoretical
    and experimental results have indicated that the reduction is possible by increasing
    the filament length. This finding may be applicable to the improvement of the
    performance of the tungsten strip lamps to match the ever-improving performance
    of the photoelectric radiation thermometers.</p>"
