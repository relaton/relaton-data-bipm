abstract:
- content: "<p>A working example of a transportable calibration system with reproduction
    by a highly stable scalar magnetic flux density (MFD) in the range from 20 µT
    to 100 µT was researched and developed. The random standard deviation was 0.003 nT
    for a 1 s interval of measurements, which included uncertainty due to reproduction
    and the measurement canal. The MFD instability did not exceed 0.03 nT for 10 h.
    The systematic uncertainty was 0.2 nT when the dimensions of the sensor sample
    were 80 mm or less.</p>"
