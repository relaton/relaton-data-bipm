  content: "<p>We report the results of the measurement of the absorptance of a LaseRad
    cavity used as an absorber in the cryogenic radiometer in the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt. The measurements were carried out at several laser wavelengths
    in the visible and near infrared (NIR), with a He–Ne laser operating at 633 nm
    and with two tunable laser sources operating between 1280 nm and 1360 nm and between
    1480 nm and 1620 nm. The absorptance of 0.999 885 ± 3.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup> measured
    at 633 nm matches very well with the value of 0.999 879 ± 1.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
    reported by the manufacturer (Cambridge Research &amp; Instrumentation, Inc.).
    In the NIR the absorptance is approximately 1.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> ± 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>
    lower than at 633 nm, which is significant for high accuracy measurements. The
    absorptance varies 19 × 10<sup>−6</sup> in the wavelength range from 1280 nm to
    1620 nm: this is almost negligible for this wavelength range.</p>"
