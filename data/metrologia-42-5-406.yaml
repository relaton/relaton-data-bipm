  content: "<p>The <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>
    (GUM) recommends the use of a first-order Taylor series expansion for propagating
    errors and uncertainties. The GUM also requires the use of a second-order Taylor
    series approximation for calculating uncertainties when the first-order approximation
    alone is not adequate. When only first-order Taylor expansions are used as a basis
    for propagating uncertainties, the first-order approximation to the standard deviation
    coincides with the first-order approximation to the root mean square error of
    an estimate. However, this is generally not true when using higher-order approximations.
    In this paper, we derive the second-order approximation of the standard deviation
    and the root mean square error of an estimate. We compare them with the correction
    terms given in the GUM and demonstrate their use via examples. We also provide
    a computer program that uses symbolic derivatives to calculate the second-order
    approximations of the uncertainty in measurement results.</p>"
