abstract:
- content: "<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) recommends
    the use of a first-order Taylor series expansion for propagating errors and uncertainties.
    The GUM also requires the use of a second-order Taylor series approximation for
    calculating uncertainties when the first-order approximation alone is not adequate.
    When only first-order Taylor expansions are used as a basis for propagating uncertainties,
    the first-order approximation to the standard deviation coincides with the first-order
    approximation to the root mean square error of an estimate. However, this is generally
    not true when using higher-order approximations. In this paper, we derive the
    second-order approximation of the standard deviation and the root mean square
    error of an estimate. We compare them with the correction terms given in the GUM
    and demonstrate their use via examples. We also provide a computer program that
    uses symbolic derivatives to calculate the second-order approximations of the
    uncertainty in measurement results.</p>"
