abstract:
- content: "<p>In the last several years we have made many improvements to NIST-F1
    (a laser-cooled Cs fountain primary frequency standard at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado) resulting in a reduction
    by over a factor of 2 in the uncertainty of the realization of the SI second.
    The two most recent accuracy evaluations of NIST-F1 had combined standard fractional
    uncertainties of 0.61 × 10<sup>−15</sup> (June 2004) and 0.53 × 10<sup>−15</sup>
    (January 2005), which were submitted to the Bureau International des Poids et
    Mesures with total fractional uncertainties (including time-transfer contributions)
    of, respectively, 0.88 × 10<sup>−15</sup> and 0.97 × 10<sup>−15</sup>. Here we
    discuss the improvements and evaluation methods and present an updated uncertainty
    budget.</p>"
