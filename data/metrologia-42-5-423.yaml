  content: "<p>The operation of a caesium fountain primary frequency standard is greatly
    influenced by the characteristics of two other important facilities. The first
    is a stable frequency reference and the second is the frequency-transfer system.
    A stable frequency reference such as a hydrogen maser is a virtual necessity since
    essentially no fountain dead time can be tolerated without it. The frequency stability
    of this reference has a significant impact on the procedures for evaluating certain
    systematic biases in the fountain. State-of-the-art frequency transfer technology
    is also necessary if the fountain is intended to contribute to TAI or to be compared
    with other remotely located frequency standards without excessive degradation
    of stated uncertainties. We discuss the facilities available at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) and how they impact the operation of NIST-F1,
    the primary frequency standard at NIST.</p>"
