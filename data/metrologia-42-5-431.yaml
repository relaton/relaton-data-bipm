  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The electronic kilogram project of NIST has improved the watt balance
    method to obtain a new determination of the Planck constant <italic>h</italic>
    by measuring the ratio of the SI unit of power W to the electrical realization
    unit W<sub>90</sub>, based on the conventional values for the Josephson constant
    <italic>K</italic><sub>J−90</sub> and von Klitzing constant <italic>R</italic><sub>K−90</sub>.
    The value <italic>h</italic> = 6.626 069 01(34) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s verifies
    the NIST result from 1998 with a lower combined relative standard uncertainty
    of 52 nW/W. A value for the electron mass <italic>m</italic><sub>e</sub> = 9.109 382 14(47)
    × 10<sup>−31</sup> kg can also be obtained from this result. With uncertainties
    approaching the limit of those commercially applicable to mass calibrations at
    the level of 1 kg, an electronically-derived standard for the mass unit kilogram
    is closer to fruition.</p>"
