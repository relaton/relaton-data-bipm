abstract:
- content: "<p>The electronic kilogram project of NIST has improved the watt balance
    method to obtain a new determination of the Planck constant h by measuring the
    ratio of the SI unit of power W to the electrical realization unit W<sub>90</sub>,
    based on the conventional values for the Josephson constant K<sub>J−90</sub> and
    von Klitzing constant R<sub>K−90</sub>. The value h = 6.626 069 01(34) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s
    verifies the NIST result from 1998 with a lower combined relative standard uncertainty
    of 52 nW/W. A value for the electron mass m<sub>e</sub> = 9.109 382 14(47) × 10<sup>−31</sup> kg
    can also be obtained from this result. With uncertainties approaching the limit
    of those commercially applicable to mass calibrations at the level of 1 kg, an
    electronically-derived standard for the mass unit kilogram is closer to fruition.</p>"
