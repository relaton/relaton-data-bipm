abstract:
- content: "<p>The classical way of estimating the activity of radioactive samples
    does not give a correct value and uncertainty when the activity has the same order
    of magnitude or is smaller than the background radiation. We propose a method
    of solving the problem based on Bayesian decision theory. The a priori distribution
    used is Jeffreys' invariant obtained by taking into account the fact that the
    number of particles emitted and detected is Poisson distributed. In contrast to
    the classical approach, the Bayesian estimate is always positive and the result
    obtained is a whole distribution (a confluent hypergeometric function) that gives
    not only the mean value but also any confidence interval. For higher activities,
    the Bayesian and classical estimates are indistinguishable.</p>"
