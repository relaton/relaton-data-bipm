abstract:
- content: "<p>The Welch–Satterthwaite (W–S) formula is used to calculate the expanded
    uncertainty of the result of a measurement. However, this appears to be counter-intuitive
    because as the uncertainty component increases, the expanded uncertainty decreases.
    To understand this, we need to trace the higher order formulae—the Welch formula
    and the Aspin formula; however, there is an error in the Aspin formula. Using
    differential and algebraic methods and introducing a special polynomial, after
    calculations and analysis of the terms, we obtain the corrected Aspin formula
    and can identify the earlier error. Using the corrected Aspin formula as well
    as the Welch formula and the W–S formula, we calculate the expanded uncertainty
    in some metrological examples. The expanded uncertainties calculated with these
    formulae are analysed using the corrected Aspin formula. We can obtain the expanded
    uncertainty more accurately in metrology, and the corrected Aspin formula is also
    useful for general mathematical statistics.</p>"
