abstract:
- content: "<p>A formalism, based on standard least squares techniques, is presented
    in which analytic expressions can be derived for the study of the influence of
    hypothetic perturbations in absolute gravimetry. The model function derived from
    the equation of motion of the test mass and possible perturbations is expanded
    in an orthogonal basis composed of the shifted Legendre polynomials, and projections
    onto the model space and the space orthogonal to this serve to isolate the contributions
    to the model parameters and to the residuals. The part of the perturbation remaining
    in the orthogonal space can be compared with those retrieved from the residuals
    of the fit of the model function to the experimental data. The analysis of the
    structure of these residuals is a major means of gaining information about the
    character of the perturbations. Finally, some explicit examples are given and
    a discussion concerning how such an analysis can be made is included.</p>"
