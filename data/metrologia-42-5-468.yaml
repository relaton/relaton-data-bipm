abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper outlines the evolution of the hydrogen maser oscillator
    and describes the basic operational requirements and the present technology. Design
    features of a high stability maser oscillator for use in space, maser operation
    at 0.5 K and the present uses of H-masers are discussed.</p><p>Due to an unfortunate
    error, the first section (i.e. the Introduction) of the original paper by Dr Robert
    F C Vessot was not printed in its entirety. The full text of the missing section
    is printed below, together with the appropriate list of references.</p>"
