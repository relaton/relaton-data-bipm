abstract:
- content: "<p>The role of measurements of the fundamental constants continues to
    be extremely valuable in underpinning the basic units of metrology. It is concluded
    that it might be preferable to sustain the present definition of the kilogram
    for an interim period by having a mise en pratique accompanying the definition,
    much as is currently done with the specified methods of realizing the metre. Central
    to this proposal is our view that there is considerable latitude in the interpretation
    of the present definition of the kilogram and that this can be exploited while
    always disseminating a consistent mass unit. This would also permit the present
    methods of maintaining and disseminating the kilogram to continue to be employed
    throughout the world where necessary at the present accuracy until the new technology
    could be phased in. An alternative definition of the kilogram, formulated in terms
    of frequency, is also introduced. This would give an ampere that fundamentally
    depends on the elementary charge, e, without the need to change the present definitions
    of the ampere and ohm.</p>"
