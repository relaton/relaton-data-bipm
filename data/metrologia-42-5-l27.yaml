  content: "<p>We have used a Monte Carlo simulation for investigating the output
    of a digital instrument, of resolution half-width <italic>a</italic>, when its
    analogue input is a Gaussian signal. The digitizing process converts an actual
    mean to an observed mean and an actual variance to an observed variance. The resulting
    relationships are plotted as two sets of graphs, in one of which the observed
    mean is the parameter, while in the other the observed variance is the parameter.
    Given an observed mean and an observed variance, it is then easy to infer from
    the graphs the corresponding actual mean and actual variance. The graphs illustrate,
    for example, that unless the observed variance is very low, the actual variance
    can be recovered from the observed variance by subtracting <italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup>/3
    from the observed variance.</p>"
