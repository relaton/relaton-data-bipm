abstract:
- content: "<p>We have used a Monte Carlo simulation for investigating the output
    of a digital instrument, of resolution half-width a, when its analogue input is
    a Gaussian signal. The digitizing process converts an actual mean to an observed
    mean and an actual variance to an observed variance. The resulting relationships
    are plotted as two sets of graphs, in one of which the observed mean is the parameter,
    while in the other the observed variance is the parameter. Given an observed mean
    and an observed variance, it is then easy to infer from the graphs the corresponding
    actual mean and actual variance. The graphs illustrate, for example, that unless
    the observed variance is very low, the actual variance can be recovered from the
    observed variance by subtracting a<sup>2</sup>/3 from the observed variance.</p>"
