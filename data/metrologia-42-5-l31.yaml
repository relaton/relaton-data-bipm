  content: "<p>The role of measurements of the fundamental constants continues to
    be extremely valuable in underpinning the basic units of metrology. It is concluded
    that it might be preferable to sustain the present definition of the kilogram
    for an interim period by having a <italic>mise en pratique</italic> accompanying
    the definition, much as is currently done with the specified methods of realizing
    the metre. Central to this proposal is our view that there is considerable latitude
    in the interpretation of the present definition of the kilogram and that this
    can be exploited while always disseminating a consistent mass unit. This would
    also permit the present methods of maintaining and disseminating the kilogram
    to continue to be employed throughout the world where necessary at the present
    accuracy until the new technology could be phased in. An alternative definition
    of the kilogram, formulated in terms of frequency, is also introduced. This would
    give an ampere that fundamentally depends on the elementary charge, <italic>e</italic>,
    without the need to change the present definitions of the ampere and ohm.</p>"
