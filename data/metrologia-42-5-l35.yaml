abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>We discuss a simple, practical transformation between the probability
    density function (PDF) of the measurand and the associated PDF of the process
    for producing measurement results, both of which are used in metrology. This transformation
    is a reflection through the reported value and captures the essential reversal
    of skewness of these two perspectives for one-dimensional cases (i.e. any scalar
    quantity with no free parameters). It is useful for reconciling the skewness of
    the measurand and measurement-results perspectives, identifying cases where the
    choice of perspective should not matter and helping to treat the exceptional cases,
    involving PDF asymmetry, where it can matter.</p>"
