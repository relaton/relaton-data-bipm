    <p>The fourth CCM (Consultative Committee for Mass and related quantities) International Conference on Pressure Metrology from Ultra-High Vacuum to Very High Pressures (10<sup>-9</sup> Pa to 10<sup>9</sup> Pa) was held at the Institute of Physics in London from 19–21 April 2005. The event, which was organized by the Low, Medium and High Pressure working groups of the CCM, was attended by in excess of one hundred participants with representatives from five continents and every regional metrology organization.</p><p>The purpose of this conference is to review all the work that is devoted to the highest quality of pressure measurement by primary standards as well as the dissemination of the pressure scale. A total of 52 papers were presented orally, and 26 as posters, in sessions that covered the following topics:<p>Latest scientific advances in pressure and vacuum metrology</p><p>Innovative transfer standards, advanced sensors and new instrument development</p><p>Primary (top-level) measurement standards</p><p>International and regional key comparisons</p><p>New approaches to calibration</p>

    It is interesting the note that since the third conference in 1999 the pressure range covered has increased by two orders of magnitude to 10<sup>9</sup> Pa, to take into account more exacting scientific and industrial demands for traceable vacuum measurement. A further feature of the conference was the increased range of instrumentation and techniques used in the realization and potential realization of pressure standards.</p><p>Seton Bennett, Director of International Metrology at the National Physical Laboratory, opened the conference and Andrew Wallard, Director of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), gave the keynote address which described the implementation of the mutual recognition arrangement and the resulting removal of metrological barriers to international trade.</p><p>Many experts have contributed significant amounts of their time to organize the event and to review the submitted papers. Thanks are due to all of these people, particularly Gianfranco Molinar who offered much advice based on experience of organizing the previous conference. Special thanks must also be made to Mitsuru Tanaka, President of the CCM, and Andrew Wallard, Director of the BIPM, for their support of the event. The event was coordinated by Jasmina Bolfek-Radovani, of the Institute of Physics, without whose tireless efforts the event would not have been as successful. The production of this issue of  Metrologia would not have been possible without the help and support of its editor, Jeffrey Williams.</p><p>The National Measurement System Directorate of the Department of Trade and Industry supported the conference and it was sponsored by DH Instruments and BOC Edwards. Additional financial assistance was also received from Chell Instruments Ltd, DH-Budenberg, GE Infrastructure Sensing, Hi-Pro Pressure Products Ltd, Kurt J Lesker Company Ltd and Leybold Vacuum UK Ltd.</p><p>Finally we would like to thank all of the conference participants who made the event both technically stimulating and enjoyable.</p><p>By the time the next CCM Pressure conference is held in Berlin in 2011, pressure science and technology will undoubtedly have moved on still further and we may see the culmination of work to realize primary pressure standards by more fundamental methods.</p>
