abstract:
- content: "<p>Results for pressure distortion coefficients (λ) obtained by five national
    metrology institutes with finite element methods (FEM) for PTB and LNE 1 GPa piston–cylinder
    units are presented. For the PTB unit they demonstrate good agreement of the FEM
    and the experimental distortion coefficients but rather large differences in the
    uncertainties, pressure distributions, gap profiles and piston fall rates. The
    reasons for differences between the theoretical real-gap and experimental λ obtained
    for the LNE unit require further clarification. The uncertainty of the gap geometry
    is identified as the main uncertainty source.</p>"
