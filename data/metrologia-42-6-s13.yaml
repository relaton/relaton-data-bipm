abstract:
- content: "<p>In the framework of a bilateral cooperation between the I.N.RI.M./University
    of Cassino and DH Instruments, the authors tested the effectiveness of finite
    element methods (FEM) in predicting the behaviour of high performance pressure
    balances that are used extensively in national metrology laboratories and industry.</p><p>The
    pressure balances under investigation operate up to 200 MPa (free deformation
    and controlled clearance types).</p><p>The results of FEM calculations are presented,
    giving information on the baseline models adopted. All FEM numerical results are
    discussed and compared with the typical characteristics of the piston–cylinders
    observed in the metrology laboratory of the pressure balance manufacturer. Conclusions
    are drawn in terms of reliability of results based on an estimation of the parameters
    that have the largest influence on the uncertainty in the investigated quantities.</p>"
