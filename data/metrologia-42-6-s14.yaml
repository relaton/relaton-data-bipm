abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a method of analysis for cross-floats between pressure balances.
    This analysis relates to the residual mass method of treating cross-float data
    in which the residual mass M<sub>e</sub> of one pressure balance is an unknown
    in the analysis, along with the effective area and the elastic distortion coefficient.
    M<sub>e</sub> is the effective mass of any unweighed parts of the piston and load
    and may include an equivalent mass for other forces on the piston such as oil
    surface tension. Two models for the analysis with the M<sub>e</sub> method are
    presented in a form suitable for linear least squares analysis: one for the calibration
    of a pressure balance and the other for the comparison of two reference pressure
    balances. This analysis is equivalent to the p-method when M<sub>e</sub> is known
    to be zero. Linear generalized least-squares estimation is shown to be convenient
    for the calculations. A pressure balance calibration is used to illustrate the
    analysis and the associated uncertainty evaluation.</p>"
