abstract:
- content: "<p>A medium and high vacuum primary standard, based on the static expansion
    method, has been set up at Centro Nacional de Metrología (CENAM), Mexico. This
    system has four volumes and covers a measuring range of 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> Pa
    to 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> Pa of absolute pressure. As part of its realization, a characterization
    was performed, which included volume calibrations, several tests and a bilateral
    key comparison. To determine the expansion ratios, two methods were applied: the
    gravimetric method and the method with a linearized spinning rotor gauge. The
    outgassing ratios for the whole system were also determined. A comparison was
    performed with Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (comparison SIM-Euromet.M.P-BK3).
    By means of this comparison, a link has been achieved with the Euromet comparison
    (Euromet.M.P-K1.b). As a result, it is concluded that the value obtained at CENAM
    is equivalent to the Euromet reference value, and therefore the design, construction
    and operation of CENAM's SEE-1 vacuum primary standard were successful.</p>"
