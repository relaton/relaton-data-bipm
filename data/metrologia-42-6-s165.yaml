abstract:
- content: "<p>The Centre for Metrology and Accreditation (MIKES) has been using a
    new type of a digital piston manometer (force-balanced piston gauge (FPG)) since
    2001. The instrument was developed by DH Instruments Inc., USA. Determination
    of the effective area was an essential part in validating the FPG in MIKES. One
    of the big advantages of the FPG is the fact that a conventional pressure balance
    can be used to determine the effective area. However, the measurement is not straightforward
    due to the lubrication gas flow in the FPG.</p><p>The effective area of the MIKES
    FPG has now been determined several times in the gauge mode by MIKES, once by
    NMi-VSL, The Netherlands, once by SP, Sweden, and twice by the manufacturer. Measurements
    in absolute mode have been made using the mercury column manometer of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt, Germany.</p><p>The measurement methods and the results are described
    in the paper. The results of measurements in MIKES from 2001 to 2004 illustrate
    the long-term stability and reproducibility of the instrument.</p>"
