  content: "<p>A controlled-clearance pressure standard has been established at the
    National Measurement Institute of Australia as a high pressure standard for the
    realization of the national scale up to 200 MPa. The area of the piston was determined
    by comparison with a 25 mm diameter piston cylinder assembly that was measured
    dimensionally and the distortion coefficient was found by calculation and experiment.
    The controlled-clearance piston gauge was used to calibrate a 100 MPa piston cylinder
    unit with results agreed to 10 × 10<sup>−6</sup> with calibration done at LNE.
    This 100 MPa unit was used in a regional key comparison with agreement to within
    20 × 10<sup>−6</sup> of the reference value.</p>"
