abstract:
- content: "<p>A new medium vacuum primary standard using the static expansion method
    was developed in Korea Research Institute of Standards and Technology. We compared
    the system with an ultrasonic interferometer manometer using two capacitance diaphragm
    gauges with full-scale ranges of 133 Pa and 1333 Pa. The results showed that the
    two standards are coincident with each other within the range of uncertainty at
    calibrated pressures 3 Pa to 100 Pa.</p>"
