abstract:
- content: "<p>The non-uniformity of the gas number density distributions in high-vacuum
    standards based on continuous gas expansion may be the cause of the differences
    that occur between the gas number density generated in the gauge to be calibrated
    and its value calculated using traditional methods. It may be the source of certain
    systematic errors of these standards. This paper presents a gas flow model that
    permits determining the gas number density directly within the volume of the gauge
    to be calibrated as a function of the gas flux that flows through the calibration
    chamber. The proposed model takes into account the whole geometrical complexity
    of the standard, thus minimizing the drawbacks of the traditional model. Examples
    of possible applications are also discussed in this paper.</p>"
