  content: "<p>The backstream from the pumping chamber to the calibration chamber
    in a continuous gas expansion vacuum standard was determined using an experimental
    method and the Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. The results were compared and appeared
    to be in agreement within 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>. This supports our opinion that
    the MC method can be a useful tool in an analysis of vacuum metrological systems.
    We can also conclude that, in analysis of high vacuum standards, the assumption
    that the scattering process is described by the cosine law is reasonable.</p>"
