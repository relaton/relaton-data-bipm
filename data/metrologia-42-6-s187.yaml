  content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has completed
    the development of a low differential-pressure primary standard covering a range
    from 1 Pa to 13 kPa for operation with line pressures up to 200 kPa. The standard
    is based on an ultrasonic interferometer manometer (UIM) primary pressure standard
    and includes a test-instrument manifold with pressure control systems. The standard
    was found to be equivalent to low differential-pressure primary standards at three
    other national metrology institutes (NMIs) in a recent international key comparison.
    Initial performance of the standard was limited in large part by pressure instabilities.
    This problem has been addressed with the development of two types of active pressure
    control, one for calibrating pressure-measuring instruments such as capacitance
    diaphragm gauges, resonant silicon gauges and Bell-type micromanometers and the
    other for characterizing pressure-generating instruments such as conical-piston,
    ball and force-balanced piston gauges. The UIM is characterized by a standard
    (<italic>k</italic> = 1) uncertainty due to systematic effects of [(3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> Pa)<sup>2</sup>
    + (3.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup><italic>P</italic>)<sup>2</sup>]<sup>1/2</sup> where <italic>P</italic>
    is the pressure in pascal. Random uncertainties are dominated by pressure instabilities
    which can be controlled to a level that varies from standard deviations of 3 mPa
    at lowest differential pressures to about 60 mPa at full range. The NIST primary
    standard is described, along with results of comparisons with primary standards
    developed at other NMIs.</p>"
