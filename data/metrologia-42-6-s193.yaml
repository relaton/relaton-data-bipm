abstract:
- content: "<p>Capacitance diaphragm gauges (CDGs) are precise electromechanical pressure
    sensors in which the displacement of a stretched thin metal diaphragm is detected
    by the measurement of a capacitance. These are very accurate gauges, and are frequently
    used as transfer gauges. To calibrate such accurate low-pressure gauges, precise
    mercury manometers have been used. However, complexity, concern about mercury
    vapour, and cost of mercury manometers have made it difficult to use these manometers
    in many industrial calibration laboratories. As a substitute, gas-operated piston
    gauges can be used for the calibration of such low-pressure gauges. However, the
    minimum pressure that is necessary to balance the tare weight, which generally
    corresponds to a pressure of several kilopascals, is a major obstacle. To reduce
    this minimum operating pressure, we adopted a variable bell-jar pressure method.
    To realize this method effectively, we developed a new mass-handling device that
    makes it possible to add or remove weights up to 200 g easily, with a resolution
    of 10 g, without breaking the vacuum during the calibration. This calibration
    system can be used to measure pressures from 100 Pa to 2 kPa in the absolute mode.
    In this paper, we also present the calibration results for two types of CDGs with
    full-scale ranges of 1330 Pa and 1000 Pa, respectively.</p>"
