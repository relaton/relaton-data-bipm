abstract:
- content: "<p>Six European metrological institutes compared their calculation methods,
    and estimated uncertainties, resulting in the derivation of the effective area
    A<sub>0</sub>(20 °C, p<sub>atm</sub>) of six piston–cylinder assemblies routinely
    in use in pressure balances that are primary standards of the pressure laboratories,
    operating in different pressure ranges in gas (up to 1 MPa) and in liquid (up
    to 1 GPa). The results for A<sub>0</sub> and its standard uncertainty u(A<sub>0</sub>)
    are presented and compared.</p>"
