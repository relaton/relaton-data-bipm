  content: "<p>We present a method of analysis for cross-floats between pressure balances.
    This analysis relates to the residual mass method of treating cross-float data
    in which the residual mass <italic>M</italic><sub>e</sub> of one pressure balance
    is an unknown in the analysis, along with the effective area and the elastic distortion
    coefficient. <italic>M</italic><sub>e</sub> is the effective mass of any unweighed
    parts of the piston and load and may include an equivalent mass for other forces
    on the piston such as oil surface tension. Two models for the analysis with the
    <italic>M</italic><sub>e</sub> method are presented in a form suitable for linear
    least squares analysis: one for the calibration of a pressure balance and the
    other for the comparison of two reference pressure balances. This analysis is
    equivalent to the <italic>p</italic>-method when <italic>M</italic><sub>e</sub>
    is known to be zero. Linear generalized least-squares estimation is shown to be
    convenient for the calculations. A pressure balance calibration is used to illustrate
    the analysis and the associated uncertainty evaluation.</p>"
