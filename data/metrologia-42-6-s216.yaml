    <p>The metrological characterization of a new standard in absolute and gauge pressure modes, in the range 1 Pa to 15 000 Pa, is described. Its effective area has been determined in gauge and absolute modes by direct comparison with a 20 cm<sup>2</sup> simple piston pressure balance. The relative difference in the effective area between the two modes is 1.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. No significant effect has been observed between the two modes for pressures down to 5 kPa. Correction coefficients have been calculated to take into account the initial condition changes. The evaluation has also provided an estimate of repeatability and linearity at low pressure.</p>
    <p>The pressure measurement uncertainty budget for this standard is presented along with some results from the calibration of working capacitance diaphragm gauges. The estimated expanded uncertainty is 8 mPa+ 2.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> × <italic>p</italic> in gauge mode and 13 mPa+ 2.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup> × <italic>p</italic> in absolute mode.</p>
