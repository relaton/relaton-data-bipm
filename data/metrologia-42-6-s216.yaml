abstract:
- content: "<p>The metrological characterization of a new standard in absolute and
    gauge pressure modes, in the range 1 Pa to 15 000 Pa, is described. Its effective
    area has been determined in gauge and absolute modes by direct comparison with
    a 20 cm<sup>2</sup> simple piston pressure balance. The relative difference in
    the effective area between the two modes is 1.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. No significant
    effect has been observed between the two modes for pressures down to 5 kPa. Correction
    coefficients have been calculated to take into account the initial condition changes.
    The evaluation has also provided an estimate of repeatability and linearity at
    low pressure.</p><p>The pressure measurement uncertainty budget for this standard
    is presented along with some results from the calibration of working capacitance
    diaphragm gauges. The estimated expanded uncertainty is 8 mPa+ 2.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
    × p in gauge mode and 13 mPa+ 2.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup> × p in absolute mode.</p>"
