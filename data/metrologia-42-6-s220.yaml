  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Calculations of the effective area and elastic distortion of piston–cylinder
    units (PCUs) used to realize fundamental pressure standards require accurate dimensional
    measurement of the cylindrical geometry of both the piston and the cylinder. A
    new instrument capable of measuring the diameter and form of PCUs up to 20 mm
    diameter with target uncertainties of 20 nm is being developed. The first stage
    of this development is the design and construction of an instrument capable of
    measuring external diameter using two mutually opposed contact probes mounted
    on precision translation stages. The positions of the probes are measured continuously
    using two sub-nanometre displacement measuring laser interferometers. The instrument
    provides a flexible working platform for future developments.</p>"
