  content: "<p>This paper presents a new device to automatically handle a large number
    of weights for the calibration of a pressure gauge. This newly invented weight-handling
    device is made for use in conjunction with a commercial oil pressure balance.
    Although the pressure balance is essential as a calibration tool, its use has
    been generally tedious and labour intensive for a long time. In particular, the
    process of loading a different combination of weights on the top of a piston requires
    repetitious manual handling for every new measurement. This inevitably leaves
    the operator fatigued, and sometimes causes damage to the weights due to careless
    handling. The newly invented automatic weight-handling device can eliminate such
    tedious, error-prone and wear-inducing manual weight manipulation. The device
    consists of a stepping motor, a drive belt, a solenoid valve, three weight-lifting
    assemblies and three linear-motion guide assemblies. The weight-lifting assembly
    is composed of a pneumatic actuator, a solid-state switch and a metal finger.
    It has many advantages compared with the commercial automatic weight-handling
    device. Firstly, it is not necessary to lift all the weights off the piston in
    the weight selection process, as it is in the case of the commercial device. Thus
    it can prevent a permanent deformation of the weight carrier. Secondly, this new
    device can handle a larger number of weights than the commercial one. This is
    because the new device adopts a different method in retaining the remaining weights
    in place. Another advantage of this new device is that there is no possibility
    of the fingers touching the surface of the weights due to the oscillation of weights.
    Moreover it uses the general technology of a stepping motor, and is also made
    up of components that are easily obtainable in the market, thereby being very
    economical.</p>"
