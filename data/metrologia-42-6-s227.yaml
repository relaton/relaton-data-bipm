  content: "<p>A calibration system for small differential pressure standards has
    been developed. The standard is realized by a pair of pressure balances, which
    generate a differential pressure of 1 Pa to 10 kPa at a line pressure of 100 kPa
    ± 10 kPa. The performance of the calibration system has been evaluated by calibrating
    several pressure transducers and positive long-term stability has been observed
    for each transducer for over a year. The standard deviation measured during the
    period was about 8 mPa in the pressure range 1 Pa to 1 kPa. These results indicate
    that the system has sufficient performance to calibrate high accuracy pressure
    transducers. The details of the system and the performance evaluation are described.</p>"
