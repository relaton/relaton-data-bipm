abstract:
- content: "<p>The LNE participated in the two EUROMET Projects No 256 and 463, the
    scopes of which were the calculation of the pressure distortion coefficient of
    identified pressure standards. The second project was also related to the uncertainty
    estimation of the values arising from the finite element analysis (FEA) used to
    perform the calculations.</p><p>Two standards of the LNE were proposed to participate
    in these projects. A full uncertainty budget for the pressure distortion coefficient
    (λ), in the 200 MPa range, determined by the FEA, is given and compared with former
    investigations.</p>"
