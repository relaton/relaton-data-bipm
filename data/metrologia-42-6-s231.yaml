  content: "<p>To determine an equilibrium state between two pressure balances accurately,
    the measurement method using a precise pressure transducer and two air-operated
    constant volume valves (CVV) is proposed in this paper. The advantages of the
    proposed method are as follows: (1) by the usage of two air-operated CVV, the
    pressure generated by the pressure balance can be connected and disconnected quickly
    to the transducer without volume change in the hydraulic circuit or heat transfer
    from the operator, (2) by managing the time intervals between measurements equally,
    the method proposed can compensate for the effect of the drift component in the
    successive values measured by the transducer used and (3) the short time stability
    of the pressure generated by each pressure balance used can be evaluated quantitatively
    at each pressure. From the measurement results, it was revealed that the equilibrium
    state could be determined accurately using the method proposed, and the differences
    between this method and the conventional fall-rate method were sufficiently small.</p>"
