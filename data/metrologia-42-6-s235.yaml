abstract:
- content: "<p>The characteristics of commercially available pressure monitors were
    evaluated. The pressure range of these pressure monitors is up to 100 MPa and
    the resolution of the transducer is 0.1 kPa. The pressure monitor includes a quartz
    Bourdon-type high-precision electronic pressure transducer inside the body. The
    sensing element of the transducer is a precision quartz crystal resonator and
    the frequency of oscillation varies with pressure-induced stress. In total, six
    pressure monitors were prepared for this study. During 15 months, the six monitors
    were calibrated simultaneously using a hydraulic pressure balance 11 times in
    total. The effects on the readings of the monitors by setting parameters and environmental
    conditions were evaluated. The important characteristics for the pressure transducer
    such as the temperature coefficient of the span reading and long-term stability
    were also evaluated quantitatively. From the evaluation results, the behaviours
    of the transducers during the period were well characterized. The standard deviation
    of the relative deviations from the least-squares best-fitting function for each
    pressure transducer was less than 6 × 10<sup>−6</sup> in the pressure range of
    30 MPa to 100 MPa and had a maximum of 11 × 10<sup>−6</sup> at 10 MPa. In this
    article, the details of the characterization are described.</p>"
