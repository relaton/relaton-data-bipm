abstract:
- content: "<p>A high resolution gauge is used to determine the change in effective
    area of a 250 MPa piston–cylinder unit as a function of jacket pressure. These
    changes are compared with values calculated using a finite element method. The
    results of the comparison revealed that the jacket pressure seals were applying
    unexpected forces to the cylinder outer diameter. These forces were modelled in
    the finite element calculations giving reasonable agreement. Further measurements
    were made after modifying the jacket seal mounting. The new results showed reasonable
    agreement at low operating pressures but large disagreement between theory and
    experiment as the operating pressure approached 250 MPa.</p>"
