abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper presents the recent progress made in the accuracy improvement
    of the manganin pressure sensors at the Warsaw University of Technology (WUT)
    and at the Institute of Nuclear Energy. The efforts of the authors were concentrated
    on three problems:</p><p>(1) The improvement of the temperature characteristics
    by the design of a manganin sensor with the temperature compensation achieved
    by the application of two manganin coils with two different temperature characteristics;</p><p>(2)
    The improvement of the calibration process by</p><p>- (a) using a high pressure
    deadweight piston gauge (with the correction of effective area versus pressure
    dependence, built at WUT),</p><p>- (b) measurements of the manganin resistance
    as a function of the temperature and of the pressure using a precise multimeter
    and</p><p>- (c) application of statistical methods for long series of measurements.</p><p>(3)
    The modification of the thermal characteristic by implantation of bismuth and
    krypton ions.</p>"
