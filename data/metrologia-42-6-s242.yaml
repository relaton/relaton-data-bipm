- language: en

  content: "<p>The measurement of pressure above atmospheric pressure relies in many
    cases on the use of piston–cylinder assemblies, often called piston gauges or
    pressure balances. One of the major limitations to the measurement uncertainty
    with which it is possible to realize the pascal is lack of knowledge of how the
    piston–cylinder assembly distorts as it becomes pressurized. The feasibility of
    directly measuring such distortion by monitoring the change in the electrical
    capacitance between the piston and cylinder as the system is pressurized has been
    demonstrated.</p>"
