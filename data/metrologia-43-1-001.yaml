abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain disciplines, uncertainty is traditionally expressed as an
    interval about an estimate for the value of the measurand. Development of such
    uncertainty intervals with a stated coverage probability based on the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO)  Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement  (GUM) requires a description of the probability distribution for
    the value of the measurand. The ISO-GUM propagates the estimates and their associated
    standard uncertainties for various input quantities through a linear approximation
    of the measurement equation to determine an estimate and its associated standard
    uncertainty for the value of the measurand. This procedure does not yield a probability
    distribution for the value of the measurand. The ISO-GUM suggests that under certain
    conditions motivated by the central limit theorem the distribution for the value
    of the measurand may be approximated by a scaled-and-shifted  t -distribution
    with effective degrees of freedom obtained from the Welch–Satterthwaite (W–S)
    formula. The approximate  t -distribution may then be used to develop an uncertainty
    interval with a stated coverage probability for the value of the measurand. We
    propose an approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty as
    an alternative to the  t -distribution based on the W–S formula. A benefit of
    the approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty is that it
    greatly simplifies the expression of uncertainty by eliminating altogether the
    need for calculating effective degrees of freedom from the W–S formula. In the
    special case where the measurand is the difference between two means, each evaluated
    from statistical analyses of independent normally distributed measurements with
    unknown and possibly unequal variances, the probability distribution for the value
    of the measurand is known to be a Behrens–Fisher distribution. We compare the
    performance of the approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty
    and the approximate  t -distribution based on the W–S formula with respect to
    the Behrens–Fisher distribution. The approximate normal distribution is simpler
    and better in this case. A thorough investigation of the relative performance
    of the two approximate distributions would require comparison for a range of measurement
    equations by numerical methods.</p>"
