abstract:
- content: "<p>Annex H.3 of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    presents an example of calibration of a thermometer using a linear regression
    model. Annex H.5 of the same publication presents another class of linear statistical
    models and analysis techniques that are commonly called the analysis of variance
    (ANOVA). The procedures given in Annexes H.3 and H.5 do not specifically include
    Type B uncertainty evaluations. A natural question then is as follows: can these
    statistical models be used when the measurements are subject to additional uncertainty,
    arising from systematic effects, that needs to be evaluated by Type B methods?
    This paper answers the question in the affirmative and provides a natural interpretation
    of the results. The data from the two Annexes are used for illustration.</p>"
