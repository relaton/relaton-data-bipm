abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we propose a two-stage Monte Carlo procedure that explicitly
    takes into account the finite sample sizes used to estimate parameters of the
    input distributions of non-linear measurement equations. We will illustrate the
    approach with a case study involving the efficiency of a thermistor mount power
    sensor. The performance of the proposed approach will be compared with the standard
    GUM (US Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, American National
    Institute of Standards, ANSI/NCSL Z540-2-1997) approach for finite samples using
    simple linear and non-linear measurement equations. We will investigate performance
    in terms of coverage probabilities of derived coverage intervals for the mean
    of the measurand. Proposed Supplement 1 to the GUM (Guide to the Expression of
    Uncertainty in Measurement, Supplement 1, currently under review to the member
    organizations of the JCGM and the national measurement institutes (draft 3rd edn))
    outlines a ‘propagation of distributions’ approach to deriving the distribution
    of a measurand for any non-linear function and for any set of random inputs. The
    Supplement's approach assumes that the distributions of the random inputs are
    known exactly. In practice, however, the distributions of the inputs will rarely
    be known exactly but must be estimated using possibly small samples. The two-stage
    Monte Carlo approach will be compared with the GUM Supplement's propagation of
    distribution approach for non-linear measurement equations. We will show that
    the GUM Supplement's approach underestimates uncertainty in the measurand if distributions
    estimated with small sample sizes are assumed to be known exactly.</p>"
