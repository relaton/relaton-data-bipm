abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper presents an analytical method for calculating a coverage
    interval. The method consists in approximation of the convolution of standard
    distributions attributed to input quantity values, such as Student's, normal,
    rectangular, triangular or trapezoidal. It may be applied when the model of a
    measurand is linear or close to linear.</p>"
