abstract:
- content: "<p>The absolute frequency of the f-component for the UME laser was measured
    with the BIPM femtosecond laser comb to be (473 612 353 602.0 ± 1.1) kHz during
    3 March to 8 March, 2003 and with the UME comb to be (473 612 353 600.6 ± 1.1) kHz
    from 20 June to 25 June, 2005. After appropriate correction for power and modulation
    shifts a subkilohertz agreement between the two measurements was found. Moreover,
    the relative frequency stability for different UME–BIPM laser pairs is investigated
    using standard heterodyne techniques and Allan variance statistics.</p>"
