abstract:
- content: "<p>Standard definitions of relative humidity Ïˆ of a gas at temperature
    t and pressure P involve the ratio of some humidity quantity to the same quantity
    when the gas is saturated at the same temperature and pressure. These definitions
    do not apply under certain conditions, notably when the gas is pure unsaturated
    water vapour, and more generally when the theoretical saturation vapour pressure
    is greater than the actual pressure. The use of impedance-based relative humidity
    sensors to measure humidity under such conditions is increasingly common and consequently
    other less well defined definitions may be used over which there is some debate
    and confusion in the metrological community. In this paper we identify the source
    of the problem, explore possible definitions and champion a simple and useful
    definition of relative humidity which extends the traditional definition to cover
    the whole range.</p>"
