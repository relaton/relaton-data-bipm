abstract:
- content: "<p>We used a quasi-spherical cavity as an acoustic and microwave resonator
    to measure the thermodynamic temperatures, T, of the triple points of equilibrium
    hydrogen, neon, argon and mercury and to measure the difference T − T<sub>90</sub>,
    in the range 7 K to 273 K. (T<sub>90</sub> is the temperature on the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).) In the range 7 K to 24.5 K, our preliminary
    values of T − T<sub>90</sub> agree with recent results from dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry and achieve uncertainties that are comparable to or smaller than
    those achievable using the interpolating constant volume gas thermometer as currently
    defined on the ITS-90. In the range 90 K to 273 K, the present results for T −
    T<sub>90</sub> obtained using a helium-filled, copper-walled, quasi-spherical
    cavity agree with earlier results obtained using argon-filled, steel-walled or
    aluminium-walled, spherical cavities. The agreement confirms our understanding
    of both acoustic and microwave cavity resonators and demonstrates that resonators
    function as primary thermometers spanning wide temperature ranges. The mutually
    consistent acoustic thermometry data from several laboratories imply that the
    values of (T − T<sub>90</sub>)/T<sub>90</sub> are 5 times larger than the uncertainty
    of T/T<sub>90</sub> near 150 K and near 400 K. They also imply that the derivative
    dT/dT<sub>90</sub> is too large by approximately 10<sup>−4</sup> near 273.16 K
    and that dT/dT<sub>90</sub> has a discontinuity of 4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> at 273.16 K.</p>"
