  content: "<p>In certain disciplines, uncertainty is traditionally expressed as an
    interval about an estimate for the value of the measurand. Development of such
    uncertainty intervals with a stated coverage probability based on the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO) <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement</italic> (GUM) requires a description of the probability distribution
    for the value of the measurand. The ISO-GUM propagates the estimates and their
    associated standard uncertainties for various input quantities through a linear
    approximation of the measurement equation to determine an estimate and its associated
    standard uncertainty for the value of the measurand. This procedure does not yield
    a probability distribution for the value of the measurand. The ISO-GUM suggests
    that under certain conditions motivated by the central limit theorem the distribution
    for the value of the measurand may be approximated by a scaled-and-shifted <italic>t</italic>-distribution
    with effective degrees of freedom obtained from the Welch–Satterthwaite (W–S)
    formula. The approximate <italic>t</italic>-distribution may then be used to develop
    an uncertainty interval with a stated coverage probability for the value of the
    measurand. We propose an approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty
    as an alternative to the <italic>t</italic>-distribution based on the W–S formula.
    A benefit of the approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty
    is that it greatly simplifies the expression of uncertainty by eliminating altogether
    the need for calculating effective degrees of freedom from the W–S formula. In
    the special case where the measurand is the difference between two means, each
    evaluated from statistical analyses of independent normally distributed measurements
    with unknown and possibly unequal variances, the probability distribution for
    the value of the measurand is known to be a Behrens–Fisher distribution. We compare
    the performance of the approximate normal distribution based on a Bayesian uncertainty
    and the approximate <italic>t</italic>-distribution based on the W–S formula with
    respect to the Behrens–Fisher distribution. The approximate normal distribution
    is simpler and better in this case. A thorough investigation of the relative performance
    of the two approximate distributions would require comparison for a range of measurement
    equations by numerical methods.</p>"
