  content: "<p>Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale Galileo Ferraris (IEN), National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Physical Laboratory (NPL),

    de Référence Temps Espace (OP) and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
    operate cold-atom based primary frequency standards which are capable of realizing
    the SI second with a relative uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup> or even below.
    These institutes performed an intense comparison campaign of selected frequency
    references maintained in their laboratories during about 25 days in October/November
    2004. Active hydrogen maser reference standards served as frequency references
    for the institutes' fountain frequency standards. Three techniques of frequency
    (and time) comparisons were employed. Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer
    (TWSTFT) was performed in an intensified measurement schedule of 12 equally spaced
    measurements per day. The data of dual-frequency geodetic Global Positioning System
    (GPS) receivers were processed to yield an ionosphere-free linear combination
    of the code observations from both GPS frequencies, typically referred to as GPS
    TAI P3 analysis. Last but not least, the same GPS raw data were separately processed,
    allowing GPS carrier-phase (GPS CP) based frequency comparisons to be made. These
    showed the lowest relative frequency instability at short averaging times of all
    the methods. The instability was at the level of 1 part in 10<sup>15</sup> at
    one-day averaging time using TWSTFT and GPS CP. The GPS TAI P3 analysis is capable
    of giving a similar quality of data after averaging over two days or longer. All
    techniques provided the same mean frequency difference between the standards involved
    within the 1σ measurement uncertainty of a few parts in 10<sup>16</sup>. The frequency
    differences between the three fountains of IEN (IEN-CsF1), NPL (NPL-CsF1) and
    OP (OP-FO2) were evaluated. Differences lower than the 1σ measurement uncertainty
    were observed between NPL and OP, whereas the IEN fountain deviated by about 2σ
    from the other two fountains.</p>"
