  content: "<p>If measurement uncertainty is to be expressed by forming a distribution
    of belief for the measurand then this should be reflected in the theory underlying
    the analysis of interlaboratory comparison data. This paper presents a corresponding
    method for the calculation of a reference value in a comparison where each laboratory
    independently assigns a probability density function, <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x</italic>),
    to the value <italic>X</italic> of a stable artefact. Straightforward argument
    shows that a consensus density function for <italic>X</italic> can be taken as
    \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro207092in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>, assuming
    that the densities of the <italic>n</italic> laboratories are reliable and mutually
    consistent. A method is also presented for examining this consistency. The result
    <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is a special case of a consensus in the
    statistical literature called the logarithmic opinion pool. The key comparison
    reference value might be taken as the mean, median or mode of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>).</p>\n<p>The
    method developed does not explicitly involve laboratory biases (offsets), which
    are important features of most methods for comparison analysis published recently
    and which are relevant to the calculation of degrees of equivalence. The belief
    approach does not seem well-suited when it is assumed that such offsets exist.</p>"
