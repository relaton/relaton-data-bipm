abstract:
- content: "<p>If measurement uncertainty is to be expressed by forming a distribution
    of belief for the measurand then this should be reflected in the theory underlying
    the analysis of interlaboratory comparison data. This paper presents a corresponding
    method for the calculation of a reference value in a comparison where each laboratory
    independently assigns a probability density function, f<sub>i</sub>(x), to the
    value X of a stable artefact. Straightforward argument shows that a consensus
    density function for X can be taken as, assuming that the densities of the n laboratories
    are reliable and mutually consistent. A method is also presented for examining
    this consistency. The result f(x) is a special case of a consensus in the statistical
    literature called the logarithmic opinion pool. The key comparison reference value
    might be taken as the mean, median or mode of f(x).</p><p>The method developed
    does not explicitly involve laboratory biases (offsets), which are important features
    of most methods for comparison analysis published recently and which are relevant
    to the calculation of degrees of equivalence. The belief approach does not seem
    well-suited when it is assumed that such offsets exist.</p>"
