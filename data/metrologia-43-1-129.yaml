  content: "<p>Standard definitions of relative humidity Ïˆ of a gas at temperature
    <italic>t</italic> and pressure <italic>P</italic> involve the ratio of some humidity
    quantity to the same quantity when the gas is saturated at the same temperature
    and pressure. These definitions do not apply under certain conditions, notably
    when the gas is pure unsaturated water vapour, and more generally when the theoretical
    saturation vapour pressure is greater than the actual pressure. The use of impedance-based
    relative humidity sensors to measure humidity under such conditions is increasingly
    common and consequently other less well defined definitions may be used over which
    there is some debate and confusion in the metrological community. In this paper
    we identify the source of the problem, explore possible definitions and champion
    a simple and useful definition of relative humidity which extends the traditional
    definition to cover the whole range.</p>"
