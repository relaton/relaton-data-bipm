abstract:
- content: "<p>We have improved the accuracy in source-based calibration of radiative
    heat flux sensors by considering the temperature non-uniformity of the blackbody
    cavity. The method measures the responsivity of a heat flux sensor as a function
    of distance from the blackbody aperture. From this variation of the responsivity,
    the temperature distribution and the effective emissivity of the blackbody can
    be determined via a Monte Carlo simulation. The calibration uncertainty is evaluated
    to be 2.3% (k = 2) for irradiance values up to 10 kW m<sup>−2</sup> at a blackbody
    temperature around 2900 °C. In order to verify the accuracy improvement, the results
    are compared with those of a detector-based calibration, which demonstrated an
    agreement within the uncertainty.</p>"
