  content: "<p>We used a quasi-spherical cavity as an acoustic and microwave resonator
    to measure the thermodynamic temperatures, <italic>T</italic>, of the triple points
    of equilibrium hydrogen, neon, argon and mercury and to measure the difference
    <italic>T</italic> − <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>, in the range 7 K to 273 K.
    (<italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> is the temperature on the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).) In the range 7 K to 24.5 K, our preliminary values of
    <italic>T</italic> − <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> agree with recent results
    from dielectric-constant gas thermometry and achieve uncertainties that are comparable
    to or smaller than those achievable using the interpolating constant volume gas
    thermometer as currently defined on the ITS-90. In the range 90 K to 273 K, the
    present results for <italic>T</italic> − <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> obtained
    using a helium-filled, copper-walled, quasi-spherical cavity agree with earlier
    results obtained using argon-filled, steel-walled or aluminium-walled, spherical
    cavities. The agreement confirms our understanding of both acoustic and microwave
    cavity resonators and demonstrates that resonators function as primary thermometers
    spanning wide temperature ranges. The mutually consistent acoustic thermometry
    data from several laboratories imply that the values of (<italic>T</italic> −
    <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>)/<italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> are 5 times larger
    than the uncertainty of <italic>T</italic>/<italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> near
    150 K and near 400 K. They also imply that the derivative d<italic>T</italic>/d<italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>
    is too large by approximately 10<sup>−4</sup> near 273.16 K and that d<italic>T</italic>/d<italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>
    has a discontinuity of 4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> at 273.16 K.</p>"
