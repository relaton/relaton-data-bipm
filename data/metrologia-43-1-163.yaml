abstract:
- content: "<p>A new coaxial measurement system has been developed to investigate
    the ac longitudinal resistance along the high-potential side of the quantum Hall
    resistance (QHR). A novel equivalent circuit of the QHR is used to analyse the
    ac measurements of the longitudinal resistances along both the low- and high-potential
    sides of the QHR sample. In addition, a bridge for the measurement of ac contact
    resistances of the sample is presented. For the first time, it is now possible
    to perform all the ac measurements whose dc equivalents are well established for
    reliable dc quantum Hall measurements. While the ac longitudinal resistances on
    the high- and low-potential sides of the sample are very similar, interesting
    differences have been observed at high resolution.</p>"
