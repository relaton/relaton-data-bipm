abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A statistical analysis for key comparisons with linear trends and multiple
    artefacts is proposed. This is an extension of a previous paper for a single artefact.
    The approach has the advantage that it is consistent with the no-trend case. The
    uncertainties for the key comparison reference value and the degrees of equivalence
    are also provided. As an example, the approach is applied to key comparison CCEMâ€“K2.</p>"
