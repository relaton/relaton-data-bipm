  content: "<p>Annex H.3 of the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
    Measurement</italic> presents an example of calibration of a thermometer using
    a linear regression model. Annex H.5 of the same publication presents another
    class of linear statistical models and analysis techniques that are commonly called
    the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The procedures given in Annexes H.3 and H.5
    do not specifically include Type B uncertainty evaluations. A natural question
    then is as follows: can these statistical models be used when the measurements
    are subject to additional uncertainty, arising from systematic effects, that needs
    to be evaluated by Type B methods? This paper answers the question in the affirmative
    and provides a natural interpretation of the results. The data from the two Annexes
    are used for illustration.</p>"
