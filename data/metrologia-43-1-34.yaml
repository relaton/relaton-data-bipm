  content: "<p>In this paper we propose a two-stage Monte Carlo procedure that explicitly
    takes into account the finite sample sizes used to estimate parameters of the
    input distributions of non-linear measurement equations. We will illustrate the
    approach with a case study involving the efficiency of a thermistor mount power
    sensor. The performance of the proposed approach will be compared with the standard
    GUM (<italic>US Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>,
    American National Institute of Standards, ANSI/NCSL Z540-2-1997) approach for
    finite samples using simple linear and non-linear measurement equations. We will
    investigate performance in terms of coverage probabilities of derived coverage
    intervals for the mean of the measurand. Proposed Supplement 1 to the GUM (<italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>, Supplement 1, currently
    under review to the member organizations of the JCGM and the national measurement
    institutes (draft 3rd edn)) outlines a ‘propagation of distributions’ approach
    to deriving the distribution of a measurand for any non-linear function and for
    any set of random inputs. The Supplement's approach assumes that the distributions
    of the random inputs are known exactly. In practice, however, the distributions
    of the inputs will rarely be known exactly but must be estimated using possibly
    small samples. The two-stage Monte Carlo approach will be compared with the GUM
    Supplement's propagation of distribution approach for non-linear measurement equations.
    We will show that the GUM Supplement's approach <italic>underestimates</italic>
    uncertainty in the measurand if distributions estimated with small sample sizes
    are assumed to be known exactly.</p>"
