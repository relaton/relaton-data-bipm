  content: "<p>For a new determination of the Avogadro constant to play a role in
    the redefinition of the mass unit, the BIPM and other laboratories must carry
    out mass comparisons at a very high level of accuracy. We must achieve mass comparison
    among a 1 kg <sup>28</sup>Si sphere and 1 kg Pt/Ir mass standards to a combined
    standard uncertainty of 4 µg. The BIPM has developed a method to reach the target
    requested by the Avogadro group. The goal of this paper is to report the advances
    at the BIPM and to describe our new method for linking between weighings in air
    and in vacuum. The results obtained by classical comparisons in air are compared
    with those obtained by the new BIPM method.</p>"
