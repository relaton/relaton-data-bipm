abstract:
- content: "<p>NIST has characterized two large diameter (35.8 mm) piston/cylinder
    assemblies as primary pressure standards in the range 0.05 MPa to 1.0 MPa with
    uncertainties approaching the best mercury manometers. The realizations of the
    artefacts as primary standards are based on the dimensional characterization of
    the piston and cylinder, and models of the normal and shear forces on the base
    and flanks of the piston. We have studied two piston/cylinder assemblies, known
    at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as PG 38 and PG 39,
    using these methods. The piston and cylinder of both assemblies were accurately
    dimensioned by Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). All artefacts appeared
    to be round within ±30 nm and straight within ±100 nm over a substantial fraction
    of their heights. PG 39 was dimensioned a second time by PTB, three years after
    the initial measurement, and showed no significant change in dimensions or effective
    area. Comparisons of the effective area of PG 38 and PG 39 from dimensional measurements,
    against those obtained with calibration against the NIST ultrasonic interferometer
    manometer (UIM), are in agreement within the combined standard (k = 1) uncertainty
    of the dimensional measurements and the UIM. A cross-float comparison of PG 38
    versus PG 39 also agreed with the dimensional characterization within their combined
    standard uncertainties and with the UIM calibrations. The expanded (k = 2) relative
    uncertainty of the effective area is about 6.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for both assemblies.</p>"
