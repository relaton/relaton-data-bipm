abstract:
- content: "<p>A series of experiments were carried out in order to observe the melting
    and the freezing behaviour of Al–Si eutectic samples under static (adiabatic)
    and dynamic (steady heating or cooling) conditions. Afterwards the samples were
    analysed by glow discharge mass spectrometry. Subsequently they were doped with
    the detected major impurities of Ag, Cu and Fe to find out by how much these impurities
    shift the melting curves. The following results were obtained: the equilibrium
    melting temperature at the run-off point was found to be (758.792 ± 0.003) °C
    and the above impurities shifted this value by 0.12 mK ppm<sup>−1</sup>, 0.20 mK ppm<sup>−1</sup>
    and 0.22 mK ppm<sup>−1</sup> by weight, respectively.</p>"
