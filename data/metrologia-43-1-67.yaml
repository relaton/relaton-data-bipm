  content: "<p>Eutectic cells of Co/C and Ni/C for use in thermocouple calibration
    were manufactured and tested to investigate their melting and freezing characteristics
    using type B thermocouples. It was observed that the melting and freezing behaviour
    of Co/C and Ni/C systems are very similar. The freezing plateaus were found to
    be flatter than those of melting, but the melting points were closer to the ideal
    transition temperatures, which is an extrapolated value to zero temperature difference
    from the set temperature to induce melting/freezing, than the freezing points.
    Based on the observed results, the melting process is recommended for use when
    calibrating thermocouples.</p>"
