  content: "<p>A newly developed low pressure detection technology using carbon nanotube
    (CNT) field emission effect has been designed and manufactured. The fabricated
    pressure sensor is of a triode type, consisting of a cathode (CNTs field emitter
    arrays), a grid and a collector. The principle described here is that, for a constant
    number of electrons available for ionization emitted from CNT arrays by a grid
    potential, a constant fraction of gas molecules will be ionized and the number
    of ions collected in a collector will be proportional to the number of gas molecules
    in the chamber traversed by the electrons. Due to the excellent field emission
    characteristics of CNT, it is possible to make a cost-effective cold cathode type
    ion gauge. A screen-printing method has been used to make the CNT cathode. A glass
    grid with Cr deposited by an e-beam has been put on the cathode with a gap of
    200 µm between two electrodes. Due to the voltage applied to the grid, the electrons
    emitted from the CNTs ionize gas molecules in the chamber and the ionized molecules
    are gathered to the collector. Then, the collector voltage is made lower than
    the grid voltage to obtain a large ionization ratio. The current detected in the
    collector is proportional to the pressure in the chamber. The ionization characteristics
    are dependent on the gas and the voltage applied to the grid and the collector.
    In this paper we will show the various metrological characteristics of the home-made
    pressure sensor utilizing CNTs.</p>"
