  content: "<p>Pair-difference chi-squared statistics are useful for analysing metrological
    consistency within a Key Comparison. We show how they relate to classical chi-squareds
    and how they can be used with full rigour, for any comparison of a scalar measurand,
    to compare the observed dispersion of results with the dispersion that would be
    expected on the basis of the claimed uncertainties. In several limits, the distributions
    of these pair-difference statistics are exact chi-squareds. For other cases, the
    Monte Carlo method can evaluate the distributions even in the presence of non-Gaussian
    uncertainty distributions, including the Student distribution to be construed
    when a participant has reported a degrees of freedom. Monte Carlo methods also
    treat inter-laboratory covariances in a transparent manner appropriate for metrology.
    Pair-difference chi-squared statistics are independent of the choice of a Key
    Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) and so may expedite the process of analysis,
    consensus building and publication for Key Comparisons. They are appropriate for
    judging pair metrology. We discuss them as a necessary, but not sufficient, test
    for a Key Comparison reported in the conventional way using a KCRV. The deficiencies
    of using solely the classical chi-squared test are discussed. A good remedy is
    available with pair-difference chi-squared statistics.</p>"
