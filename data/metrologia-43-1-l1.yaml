abstract:
- content: "<p>In this short communication we compare E<sub>n</sub> values taking
    into account the covariance with the corresponding ‘exclusive’ statistic in an
    interlaboratory study framework. The conclusion from this analysis is that there
    are no differences between the E<sub>n</sub> values accounting for covariance
    and the corresponding ‘exclusive’ statistics.</p>"
