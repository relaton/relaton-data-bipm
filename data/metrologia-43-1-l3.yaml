abstract:
- content: "<p>The Planck constant, the Avogadro constant and the molar mass of carbon-12
    satisfy a compatibility condition: the product of the first two quantities is
    proportional to the third. Independently fixing any two of these quantities at
    exact values creates invariant redefinitions of the SI base units for both mass
    and amount of substance. The third quantity is then determined by the compatibility
    condition. Of the three possible alternatives, the strategy of fixing the Planck
    constant to give an invariant redefinition of the base unit for mass together
    with fixing the Avogadro constant to give an invariant redefinition of the base
    unit for amount of substance, while necessarily relaxing the exactness constraint
    on the molar mass of carbon-12, has a number of positive attributes that would
    seem to make it worth considering along with the other two strategies that each
    fix the molar mass of carbon-12.</p>"
