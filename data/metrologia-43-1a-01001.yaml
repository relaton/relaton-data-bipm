abstract:
- content: "<p>From February 2000 to March 2003 the international CCEM-K9 key comparison
    of AC–DC high voltage transfer standards was completed. AC–DC transfer standards
    were compared at 200 V, 500 V and 1000 V. At 1 kHz, the agreement between the
    results submitted by the participants and the key comparison reference value is
    of the order of 5 µV/V at all test voltages. At the frequency of 100 kHz, the
    agreement is of the order of 10 µV/V and 15 µV/V at 500 V and 1000 V respectively.</p><p>Main

    text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
