    <p>From February 2000 to March 2003 the international CCEM-K9 key comparison of AC–DC high voltage transfer standards was completed. AC–DC transfer standards were compared at 200 V, 500 V and 1000 V. At 1 kHz, the agreement between the results submitted by the participants and the key comparison reference value is of the order of 5 µV/V at all test voltages. At the frequency of 100 kHz, the agreement is of the order of 10 µV/V and 15 µV/V at 500 V and 1000 V respectively.</p>
