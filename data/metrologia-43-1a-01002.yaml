abstract:
- content: "<p>A bilateral key comparison of dc voltage at the 1.018 V and 10 V levels
    took place in 2002 between the National Measurement Institute of Australia (NMIA)
    as the pilot laboratory and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of
    Hong Kong. The comparison artefact was a Fluke 732B, property of the SCL, whose
    temperature, humidity and pressure coefficients were measured at the NMIA before
    the commencement of the comparison. In order to link the results to the BIPM through
    the key comparisons BIPM.EM-K11a and b, a further comparison was performed between
    the NMIA and the BIPM in late 2003, using for this purpose four 732Bs of the BIPM.</p><p>Main

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
