    <p>A bilateral key comparison of dc voltage at the 1.018 V and 10 V levels took place in 2002 between the National Measurement Institute of Australia (NMIA) as the pilot laboratory and the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Hong Kong. The comparison artefact was a Fluke 732B, property of the SCL, whose temperature, humidity and pressure coefficients were measured at the NMIA before the commencement of the comparison. In order to link the results to the BIPM through the key comparisons BIPM.EM-K11a and b, a further comparison was performed between the NMIA and the BIPM in late 2003, using for this purpose four 732Bs of the BIPM.</p>
