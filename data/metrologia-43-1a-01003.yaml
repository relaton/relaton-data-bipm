abstract:
- content: "<p>The international EUROMET 557 key comparison of AC–DC high voltage
    transfer standards started in February 2000 and was completed in March 2003. AC–DC
    transfer standards were compared at 200 V, 500 V and 1000 V. At 1 kHz, the agreement
    between the results given by the participants and the key comparison reference
    value is of the order of 5 µV/V at all test voltages. At the frequency of 100 kHz,
    the agreement at 500 V and 1000 V is of the order of 15 µV/V. In this comparison,
    the same travelling standards and then the same reference value as in the CCEM-K9
    key comparison were used.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
