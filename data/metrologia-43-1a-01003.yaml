    <p>The international EUROMET 557 key comparison of AC–DC high voltage transfer standards started in February 2000 and was completed in March 2003. AC–DC transfer standards were compared at 200 V, 500 V and 1000 V. At 1 kHz, the agreement between the results given by the participants and the key comparison reference value is of the order of 5 µV/V at all test voltages. At the frequency of 100 kHz, the agreement at 500 V and 1000 V is of the order of 15 µV/V. In this comparison, the same travelling standards and then the same reference value as in the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/01001">CCEM-K9</ext-link> key comparison were used.</p>
