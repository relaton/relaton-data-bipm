abstract:
- content: "<p>A measurement comparison of noise temperature has been carried out
    between four national metrology laboratories in coaxial line at 30 MHz, 60 MHz
    and 1 GHz. The identification of this intercomparison is CCEM.RF-K18.CL. Two noise
    sources have been measured. The following four national laboratories participated
    in this intercomparison: NPL (United Kingdom), NIST (United States of America),
    BNM-LNE (France) and VNIIFTRI (Russia). The National Physical Laboratory (UK)
    acted as the pilot laboratory for the comparison. It can be seen that there is
    generally good agreement between the laboratories.</p><p>Main text. To reach the

    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
