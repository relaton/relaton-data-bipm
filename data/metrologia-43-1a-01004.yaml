    <p>A measurement comparison of noise temperature has been carried out between four national metrology laboratories in coaxial line at 30 MHz, 60 MHz and 1 GHz. The identification of this intercomparison is CCEM.RF-K18.CL. Two noise sources have been measured. The following four national laboratories participated in this intercomparison: NPL (United Kingdom), NIST (United States of America), BNM-LNE (France) and VNIIFTRI (Russia). The National Physical Laboratory (UK) acted as the pilot laboratory for the comparison. It can be seen that there is generally good agreement between the laboratories.</p>
