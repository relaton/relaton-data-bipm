abstract:
- content: "<p>An international comparison of thermal noise-power measurements has
    been carried out among five national metrology institutes between 12.4 GHz and
    18 GHz. Four transfer standards were measured. The following national institutes
    participated: BNM–LCIE (France), NPL (United Kingdom), PTB (Germany), NIST (United
    States of America) and VNIIFTRI (Russia). The Bureau National de Métrologie–Laboratoire
    Central des Industries Electriques (France) acted as the pilot laboratory for
    the comparison.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on

    key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
