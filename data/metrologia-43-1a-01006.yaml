    <p>The comparison 'EUROMET-Project Nr 520', which started in April 1999 under the responsibility of the Swiss Federal Office of Metrology, was extended to a GT-RF comparison 'CCEM-RF-K.20' which officially started in September 2000, with more participants. The goal of this comparison was to assess the capability of each participating laboratory to measure electromagnetic field strength by calibrating a circulated field strength meter in the frequency range 10 MHz to 1 GHz. The comparison has been interrupted and further continued and ended finally in September 2004 when we received the measurements from all participants. This document presents the results of this comparison in the form of a Final Report.</p>
    <p>Despite the fact that the probe may have suffered instabilities during the five-year duration of this exercise, we consider that the results of all participants are consistent with the claimed uncertainty. The results support the equivalence of national standards laboratories for realization of field strength in the frequency range 10 MHz–1000 MHz.</p>
