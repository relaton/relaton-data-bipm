abstract:
- content: "<p>The comparison 'EUROMET-Project Nr 520', which started in April 1999
    under the responsibility of the Swiss Federal Office of Metrology, was extended
    to a GT-RF comparison 'CCEM-RF-K.20' which officially started in September 2000,
    with more participants. The goal of this comparison was to assess the capability
    of each participating laboratory to measure electromagnetic field strength by
    calibrating a circulated field strength meter in the frequency range 10 MHz to
    1 GHz. The comparison has been interrupted and further continued and ended finally
    in September 2004 when we received the measurements from all participants. This
    document presents the results of this comparison in the form of a Final Report.</p><p>Despite
    the fact that the probe may have suffered instabilities during the five-year duration
    of this exercise, we consider that the results of all participants are consistent
    with the claimed uncertainty. The results support the equivalence of national
    standards laboratories for realization of field strength in the frequency range
    10 MHz–1000 MHz.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on  Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
