abstract:
- content: "<p>A supplementary comparison of RF power measurements using 2.4 mm connectors
    was performed at nine national metrology laboratories. The traveling standards
    were two commercial thermoelectric sensors and an associated power meter. Measurements
    were made at eight frequencies between 2 and 50 GHz. This is the first comparison
    to make measurements above 26.5 GHz with coaxial connectors. All participant measurements
    agree with the reference values within their expanded uncertainty. The participants
    represent the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
    Canada, South Africa, Australia, Japan and Korea. The pilot laboratory was the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States.</p><p>Main
