    <p>A supplementary comparison of RF power measurements using 2.4 mm connectors was performed at nine national metrology laboratories. The traveling standards were two commercial thermoelectric sensors and an associated power meter. Measurements were made at eight frequencies between 2 and 50 GHz. This is the first comparison to make measurements above 26.5 GHz with coaxial connectors. All participant measurements agree with the reference values within their expanded uncertainty. The participants represent the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Japan and Korea. The pilot laboratory was the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the United States.</p>
