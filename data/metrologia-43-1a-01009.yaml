abstract:
- content: "<p>This report summarizes the results and the measuring methods of an
    international key comparison between twelve national metrology institutes (NMIs)
    and is concerning the calibration factor of RF power sensors in the coaxial 3.5
    mm line for frequencies up to 26 GHz. Two RF power travelling standards fitted
    with male PC 3.5 mm connectors were measured at seven frequencies. The following
    NMIs participated: NMIJ (Japan), NRC (Canada), NIST (USA), METAS (Switzerland),
    CSIR-NML (South Africa), NMIA (Australia), NPL (UK), SiQ (Slovenia), IEN (Italy),
    VNIIFTRI (Russian Federation), SPRING (Singapore) and PTB (Germany), as the pilot
    laboratory.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
