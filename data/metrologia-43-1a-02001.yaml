    <p>The calibration of the chromatic dispersion properties of single-mode fibres is of critical importance for a proper optimization of optical fibre communication systems. Although extensive analyses of the commonly used calibration techniques were already performed by some NMIs, no large scale interlaboratory comparisons that could be used as a basis for the MRA existed at this time. The aim of this project was to perform a comparison of chromatic dispersion measurements that were carried out on four of the most commonly used fibre types, namely G652, G653, G655-TeraLight and G655-Leaf. This intercomparison was also registered as a supplementary comparison (Euromet-PR-S1) and will serve as a basis for the review of the CMC entries on chromatic dispersion.</p>
    <p>This intercomparison addressed the calibration of the three relevant quantities, namely the chromatic dispersion, the zero dispersion wavelength and the dispersion slope. All laboratories used quite similar equipment, but applied very different measurement strategies and data processing techniques. Very good agreement was found between the results provided by most of the participants. One laboratory obtained results with more significant deviations, probably due to a problem in its measurement setup. The results of this laboratory have been analyzed in this report, but have not been used for the determination of the mean value of the reported quantities.</p>
