    <p>A bilateral comparison of spectral irradiance using tungsten halogen lamps as transfer standards covering the spectral region from 250 nm to 1600 nm was carried out between the NMIA and the SPRING Singapore in the period from November 2003 to August 2004. The NMIA acted as the pilot laboratory and provided the link to the key comparison CCPR-K1.a.</p><p>The spectral irradiance units measured by the NMIA and the SPRING Singapore in this comparison are in agreement within the combined standard uncertainties of the laboratories over the wavelength range compared.</p><p>The SPRING Singapore's spectral irradiance scale is based on a group of four NIST-calibrated standard lamps, three of which were calibrated prior to 2001 and one of which was calibrated in late 2001 after NIST adopted a new detector-based scale. There appear to be systematic differences between the two scales which are close to differences between the NMIA scale and the two NIST scales as represented by the group of reference lamps used at the SPRING Singapore.</p><p>Main text.
