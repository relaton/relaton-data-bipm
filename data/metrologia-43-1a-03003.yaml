  content: "<p>At its 19th session in September 1996, the Consultative Committee for
    Thermometry (CCT) agreed to conduct an international key comparison of the local
    realizations of the International Temperature Scale (ITS) of 1990 above the silver
    point. High-stability tungsten-strip lamps were selected as transfer standards.
    The measurements began in 1997 and ended in July 1999. The comparison was piloted
    by the NMi-VSL and co-piloted by the NPL. The national metrology institutes of
    12 countries participated in this key comparison and the initial Draft A report
    was circulated in October 1999. With the circulation of the report, some participants
    became aware of problems with their local scale realizations. To link their improved
    local scale realization to the CCT-K5 results, the NRC asked the PTB to pilot
    a bilateral comparison of the realization of the ITS-90 between the silver point
    and 1700 °C using a pair of tungsten-strip lamps as transfer standards. The measurements
    were carried out from June 2001 to October 2002.</p>\n<p>The results of the bilateral
    comparison presented in figures 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that the NRC and PTB
    local scale realizations of the ITS-90 between the silver point and 1700 °C agree
    within the combined standard uncertainty. As the scale realization of the PTB
    remained unchanged since the measurements performed for the CCT-K5, this bilateral
    comparison has successfully linked the improved scale realization of the NRC to
    the results of the key comparison via the stable scale realization of the PTB.</p>\n<p><inline-graphic
