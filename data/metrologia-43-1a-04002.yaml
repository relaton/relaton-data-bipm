    <p>Calibration services of five countries from the Sistema Interamericano de Metrología (SIM) region are compared through measurements of surface roughness and step height standards. A surface roughness standard with a nominal roughness average (<italic>Ra</italic>) value of 0.2 µm, a surface roughness standard with a nominal  <italic>Ra</italic> value of 3 µm and a nominal spatial wavelength of 99 µm, and three step height standards with nominal values of 2.55 µm, 0.38 µm and 0.03 µm are compared. Special attention is paid to the influence of the long wavelength cut-off ratio of the measurements. Results are reported for  <italic>Ra</italic>, maximum height of profile  <italic>Rz</italic>, mean width of profile elements  <italic>RSm</italic>, and step height  <italic>d</italic>, depending on the sample measured. The initial reported results show that the laboratories agree on all of the measurements within their stated and published uncertainties. Observations are then discussed about the definition of  <italic>Rz</italic>, the effect of instrument noise on  <italic>Rz</italic>, the different step height parameters  <italic>d</italic> and  <italic>Pt</italic>, differences between the laboratories in reporting Type A statistical uncertainties, the method for calculating the uncertainty of the reference value, and the importance of accounting for correlations between the reference value and individual lab values when calculating the degrees of equivalence. After corrections and reanalysis the laboratories still agree well considering their stated uncertainties.</p>
