    <p>The results of the EUROMET key comparison on long gauge block measurement by interferometry (EUROMET.L-K2) are reported. The comparison involved the measurement, by 22 participating laboratories, of six steel gauge blocks ranging from 150 mm to 900 mm in length using techniques based on interferometry or mechanical comparison. The artefact circulation was performed in two loops, with two artefacts being replaced at the end of the first loop due to damage. The results are in very good agreementâ€”out of the 93 results reported, all but 7 are in agreement (within their  <italic>k</italic> = 2 uncertainties) with the weighted mean values taken to be the Key Comparison Reference Values. The results of this key comparison will contribute to the Mutual Recognition Arrangement and will be used to link with results from other regional comparisons and the Key Comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/04004">CCL-K2</ext-link>.</p>
