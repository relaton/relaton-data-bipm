    <p>The results of the APMP key comparison on calibration of gauge blocks by interferometry (APMP.L-K1) are reported. The comparison involved the measurement, by ten participating institutes, of eight steel gauge blocks and ten ceramic gauge blocks ranging from 0.5 mm to 100 mm in length using techniques based on interferometry. The results are analysed using E<sub>n</sub> values with weighted mean values as the reference values. Some measurement results had to be excluded by application of the E<sub>n</sub>-criterion for the steel and ceramic gauges. Investigations of the reasons for the deviations have already been started by the respective institutes, including follow-up gauge block comparison, APMP.L-K1.1 with the same pilot laboratory as APMP.L-K1.</p><p>Main text.
