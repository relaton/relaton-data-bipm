    <p>Results are given for the first Asia Pacific Metrology Program comparison of long gauge blocks (APMP.L-K2). The comparison involved 12 laboratories and took three years from January 2000 to April 2003. Four laboratories measured with interferometers, followed by eight laboratories using comparison or hybrid interferometric/comparison measurements. All three long gauge blocks showed some change in length, with the 200 mm gauge growing, while the 250 mm and 500 mm contracted. Three reference values were investigated: a simple mean, a weighted mean and a weighted linear regression. The weighted linear regression gave the best results with the smallest reference value uncertainty and best overall results for participants. All the laboratories except two achieved good results, based on their claimed uncertainty.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
