    <p>The results of the CCL key comparison on the calibration of a step gauge and ball bars are reported (CCL-K5). Nine NMIs participated in the comparison. The measured artifacts were a step gauge of 1000 mm length and three ball bars: two made from steel (400 mm and 800 mm in length) and one from Super Invar (800 mm long). The Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) for the step gauge was the mean of four laboratories, and the mean of all participants for the ball bars. The data for the step gauge have been analysed into constant and proportional components to reduce the quantity of data and separate out the random variation in measurements from proportional errors which generally have a different cause. All participating NMIs measured the step gauge and were generally in good agreement. Some results revealed problems with this measurement, and as such, helped to improve the measurement procedures of these NMIs for the future. Only a few NMIs delivered data for the ball bars and these results were in good agreement.</p>
