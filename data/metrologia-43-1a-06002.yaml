abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2005, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) submitted
    a sample of known activity of<sup>111</sup>In to the International Reference System
    (SIR). The value of the activity submitted was about 28 MBq. This key comparison
    result is the first result for Germany in the matrix of degrees of equivalence
    in the key comparison database that now contains six results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.In-111.</p><p>Main
    text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this
    text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
