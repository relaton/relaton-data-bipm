abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 2004, both the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and
    the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (Geel) have submitted samples
    of known activity of<sup>60</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR).
    The values of the activity submitted were about 1.4 MBq. The key comparison results
    now include an IRMM result for the first time and have been updated for Japan.
    The key comparison reference value has been re-evaluated following the recommendations
    of the CCRI(II) and the matrix of degrees of equivalence in the key comparison
    database now contains 22 results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60.</p><p>Main
    text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this
    text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
