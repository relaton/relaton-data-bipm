abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM) has been made in<sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation under the auspices of the
    key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. The comparison result, based on the calibration
    coefficients for three transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the PTB
    and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9961 (0.0037). This result
    replaces the earlier PTB value in this key comparison. The degrees of equivalence
    between the PTB and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the twelve national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) that have taken part in the ongoing comparison for absorbed
    dose to water. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text. To reach
    the main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section I
    of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(I)), according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
