abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2005, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany submitted
    a sample of known activity of<sup>222</sup>Rn to the International Reference System
    (SIR). The value of the activity submitted was about 1.1 MBq. This key comparison
    result joins that of Switzerland in the key comparison database that now contains
    two results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Rn-222. Consequently, the KCRV and the
    degrees of equivalence have been evaluated.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by Section II of the
    Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
