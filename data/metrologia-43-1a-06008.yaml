abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1978, eight national metrology institutes (NMIs) and one other
    laboratory have submitted 15 samples of known activity of<sup>67</sup>Ga to the
    International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures in the ongoing key comparison, BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ga-67. The
    activities ranged from about 3 MBq to 600 MBq. The recent submission from the
    LNE–LNHB, France, replaces their earlier result in the key comparison database
    for this comparison. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been recalculated
    and the degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the
    SIR are given in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main
    text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database
    \ kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for
    publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
