- content: |-
    <p>A supplementary bilateral comparison was carried out to compare the pressure defined by the CMI (Czech Republic) and the METAS (Switzerland). This comparison was motivated by the introduction of new measuring equipment in these laboratories. The transfer standard of the comparison is a piston-cylinder of about 10 cm<sup>2</sup> whose effective area was determined at nine different values of pressure between 50 kPa and 600 kPa.
    The effective areas determined by the two laboratories are equivalent within the uncertainties. The results obtained by cross-floating are also in agreement with dimensional characterization of the transfer standard.
    This comparison is registered as Euromet project 788.</p><p>Main text.
