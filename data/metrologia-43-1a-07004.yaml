    <p>This report details the method and results of a bilateral comparison carried out between the national force standard machines of Egypt and the United Kingdom, in the range from 5 kN to 5 MN. The results are analysed using the  <italic>E<sub>n</sub></italic> ratio technique and indicate that the uncertainty claims of the two laboratories can, in general, be supported. A number of recommendations on revised protocols to be used for future comparisons are also given.</p>
