abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A key comparison was performed in order to compare national measurement systems to determine volume of liquids, particularly at fixed volumes of 20 L and 100 mL. The participants were CENAM (Mexico), NIST (United States of America), NRC/MC (Canada), SP (Sweden), PTB (Germany), INRIM (former IMGC, Italy), NMIA (Australia) and INMETRO (Brazil). CENAM acted as pilot laboratory. The measurements were carried out from December 2003 to March 2005.</p><p>The chosen values of volume (20 L and 100 mL) are both representatives of the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) declared by most of the participating national metrology institutes.</p><p>The transfer standards (TSs) were three stainless steel pipettes for volume at 20 L and six commercially available glass pycnometers for volume at 100 mL. Prior to the beginning of the key comparison, the 20 L TSs were tested by CENAM, SP and NMIA The results of the test phase showed excellent values for both repeatability and reproducibility.</p><p>During the CCM.FF-K4, the results of most of the laboratories showed good agreement with the reference values. The best estimation of the measurands, as reported by the participants showed a general agreement better than ±0.0025% for volume of liquids at 100 mL and 20 L.</p><p>Main text.
