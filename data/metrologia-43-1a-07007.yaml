    <p>This report describes the results on a CIPM key comparison of solid density measurements, which was carried out through July 2001 to May 2003. This CIPM key comparison, designated as CCM.D-K1, was coordinated by the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ, Japan), Swiss Federal Office of Metrology and Accreditation (METAS, Switzerland) and National Research Council Canada (NRC, Canada). These three national metrology institutes (NMIs) formed a pilot group to determine the technical protocol for this key comparison. A total of eight NMIs, namely NMIJ, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany), Istituto di Metrologia 'G Colonnetti' (IMGC, Italy), Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, Korea), METAS, NRC, Centro Español de Metrologia (CEM, Spain) and National Center of Metrology (CENAM, Mexico), participated in this key comparison. A 1 kg single-crystal silicon sphere, prepared by NMIJ, was circulated to each of the NMIs as a travelling standard. Each NMI determined the mass, volume and density of the travelling standard with respect to the mass standard and solid density standard of each NMI by mass measurement and hydrostatic weighing. The reference value of the density was determined with a relative expanded uncertainty of 2.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup>. When the degrees of equivalence were evaluated by differences from the reference value, the differences for the mass, volume and density were almost equal to or less than expanded uncertainties of the differences, showing a good equivalence of the capabilities for the solid density measurement at the participating NMIs.</p><p>Main text.
