abstract:
- content: "<p>The calibration of gas meters for flow rate measurements of natural
    gas at high pressure is of critical importance for gas importers, gas distributors
    and international trade. It is recommended to calibrate gas meters actually with
    natural gas at high pressure; however, some countries apply compressed air or
    nitrogen as a surrogate fluid.</p><p>Key comparisons (KCs) have been organized
    among all national metrology organizations (NMIs) worldwide that maintain national
    standards and take care of compressed air/nitrogen flow metrology. It turned out
    that, for the time being, only four NMIs were ready to participate, as no other
    NMIs or countries maintain national standards. These four NMIs are LNE in Paris,
    NEL in Great Britain, CMS/ITRI in Chinese Taipei, and KRISS in Korea. PTB-pigsar
    in Germany has been used as the pilot lab for the initial calibration of the transfer
    standard.</p><p>All existing facilities in the world were invited to participate,
    but they all refrained from participation, as they are not yet ready, e.g. CEESI,
    SwRI, NIST. Russia does not maintain a calibration facility for this type of fluid
    flow so far. For more details we refer to the full report.</p><p>The KC for compressed
    air was conducted during November 2004/June 2005 successfully at flow rates over
    a wide overlapping range of flow rate and pressure using a set of turbine meters.
    The transfer package comprises of two turbine meters put in series. Flow rates
    between 65 m<sup>3</sup>/h and 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/h and pressures between 5 bar
    and 40 bar have been applied.</p><p>It shall be mentioned here that the weighted
    average for the KCRV according to a BIPM recommendation for KCs has been used
    as the first choice. The final report presents the degree of equivalence among
    the participants as well as the degree of equivalence to the KCRV and confirms
    all claimed uncertainties of the national calibration facilities of France, Great
    Britain, Korea and Chinese Taipei. In addition, a link to CCM.FF-K5a for natural
    gas can be made. Quantitative E<sub>n</sub> values for the degree of equivalence
    of all participants referred to the KCRV as well as the degree of equivalence
    among the participating NMIs have been reported too.</p><p>It turned out that
    all claimed uncertainties of the calibration and measuring capabilities of the
    participating facilities could be confirmed.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
