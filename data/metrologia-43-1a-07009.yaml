abstract:
- content: "<p>Pycnometers are currently used for the measurement of the density of
    different liquids (from water to high viscosity inks). In order to have a correct
    density measurement the volume of the pycnometer must be obtained by calibration.
    Usually the calibration method is a gravimetric method.</p><p>In 2002 a project
    for the comparison of the volume of 100 ml Gay-Lussac pycnometer was initially
    proposed in the EUROMET TC Flow. Fourteen NMIs agreed to participate and the EUROMET
    692 project started officially in September 2002 and was concluded in March 2004.</p><p>The
    main purpose of the project was to compare the experimental method and the uncertainty
    calculation in the pycnometer volume determination and it was expected to be representative
    for all types of laboratory glassware.</p><p>In the EUROMET TC Flow 2006 in Lisbon
    it was decided to propose this project as a EUROMET Key Comparison due to the
    good overall agreement found. It was therefore necessary to link the EUROMET 692
    results with the Key Comparison   CCM.FF-K4. Because the pycnometers were not
    identical in both intercomparisons, some calculations on equivalence were performed
    based on BIPM rules.</p><p>The results of all laboratories participating in EUROMET
    project 692 are presented in this report as well as their equivalence with the
    reference value of the key comparison   CCM.FF-K4.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach
    the main text of this paper, click on   Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
