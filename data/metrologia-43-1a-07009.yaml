    <p>Pycnometers are currently used for the measurement of the density of different liquids (from water to high viscosity inks). In order to have a correct density measurement the volume of the pycnometer must be obtained by calibration. Usually the calibration method is a gravimetric method.</p>
    <p>In 2002 a project for the comparison of the volume of 100 ml Gay-Lussac pycnometer was initially proposed in the EUROMET TC Flow. Fourteen NMIs agreed to participate and the EUROMET 692 project started officially in September 2002 and was concluded in March 2004.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of the project was to compare the experimental method and the uncertainty calculation in the pycnometer volume determination and it was expected to be representative for all types of laboratory glassware.</p>
    <p>In the EUROMET TC Flow 2006 in Lisbon it was decided to propose this project as a EUROMET Key Comparison due to the good overall agreement found. It was therefore necessary to link the EUROMET 692 results with the Key Comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/07005">CCM.FF-K4</ext-link>. Because the pycnometers were not identical in both intercomparisons, some calculations on equivalence were performed based on BIPM rules.</p>
    <p>The results of all laboratories participating in EUROMET project 692 are presented in this report as well as their equivalence with the reference value of the key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/07005">CCM.FF-K4</ext-link>.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
