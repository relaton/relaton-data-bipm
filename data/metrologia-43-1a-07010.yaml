abstract:
- content: "<p>In the framework of the Working Group on Hardness (WGH) of the Consultative
    Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) in the year 2003 the key comparison
    Vickers hardness was finished. In the comparison the hardness laboratories of
    the following national metrology institutes participated: IMGC (Italy), NIST (USA),
    INMETRO (Brazil), NIM (PR China), KRISS (Republic of Korea), NMIJ (Japan), CMI
    (Czech Republic), GUM (Poland) and NPL (UK), and PTB (Germany) served as the pilot
    laboratory. The comparison of the Vickers primary hardness standard machines was
    carried out with three sets of hardness reference blocks of the Vickers scales
    HV0,2, HV1 and HV30, each with the hardness levels 240 HV, 540 HV and 840 HV.
    The Vickers key comparison for all test force ranges used (Vickers microhardness,
    low-force Vickers hardness, Vickers hardness) delivered the following results.</p><p>Main
