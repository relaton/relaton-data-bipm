    <p>A Key Comparison (CCQM-K31) of the determination of arsenic in a marine shellfish (oyster
    tissue) was conducted under the auspices of the CCQM Inorganic Analysis Working Group as
    a follow-up to the CCQM-P11 Pilot Study. Arsenic was present at naturally occurring levels,
    and in naturally occurring (non-spiked) forms in this material. Six national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) and one unofficial participant submitted data for this study using a variety of
    analytical methods. One lab appeared to have analytical problems and asked that their results
    be excluded from the Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV). The remaining five reported
    arsenic results from official participants fell into a range of 11% (relative, compared to the
    mean) with a relative standard deviation of 4.4%. The observed results were considerably
    worse than those from the Pilot Study, even though the matrix and analyte levels were nearly
    identical. Excluding the results from one apparently outlying lab in CCQM-P11, the observed
    range of data from ten labs was 5.4% (relative, compared to the mean) with a relative standard
    deviation of 1.7%.</p><p>Main text.
