abstract:
- content: "<p>CCQM-K13.1 is a Subsequent Key Comparison \nfor Cadmium and Lead in
    Sediment\nconducted to provide the opportunity for two NMIs to demonstrate and
    document\nimprovements in measurement capability achieved since the conduct of
    CCQM-K-13,\nAmount content of Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb) in sediment. \nThe CCQM-K13
    key\ncomparison, completed in 2001, was a successor to CCQM-P15 (Cadmium and Lead
    content\nin sediment) study, and was performed to demonstrate and document the
    capability of\ninterested National Metrology Institutes to measure Cd and Pb content
    in a sediment sample.\nThe P15, K13 and K13.1 comparisons were activities of the
    Inorganic Analysis Working\nGroup (IAWG) of CCQM. CCQM-P15 and K13 were coordinated
    by the Institute for\nReference Materials and Measurements (IRMM, Geel, Belgium)
    of the Joint Research Centre\n(JRC) of the European Commission. The majority of
    the participants applied isotope dilution\nmass spectrometry (IDMS) using various
    mass spectrometry techniques. External standard\ncalibration was used by two participants
    for the Cd measurement and by one participant for\nthe Pb measurement.</p><p>Satisfactory
    agreement of reported results was observed for most participants in CCQM-K13;\nhowever,
    two NMIs (CEMAN and PTB) wished to participate in a subsequent Key\nComparison
    to demonstrate improved performance of their analytical capabilities. Since\nNIST
    was in the process of certifying a new marine sediment SRM (2702), and both Cd
    and\nPb were going to be determined by the same methods used in CCQM-K13, it was
    decided to\nuse this opportunity to perform a Subsequent Key Comparison (CCQM-K13.1).
    As NIST had\nsuccessfully participated in both the pilot study and K13, it served
    as the anchor point to\nwhich the other participants in the subsequent study could
    be compared. CENAM signed up\nto determine Cd only in this study, and PTB signed
    up for both Pb and Cd. The NIST and\nPTB results for Pb exhibited good overlap.
    However, problems were observed for Cd. The\nNIST and CENAM Cd results did not
    overlap, and PTB could not report an official result for\nCd largely due to suspected
    isobaric interferences.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper,
