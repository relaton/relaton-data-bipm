    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K33 was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of the CCQM to test the abilities of the national metrology institutes to measure the mass fractions of minor elements in steel. Elements to be analysed were Cr, Mn, Ni and Mo in low alloy steel. The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) acted as the coordinating laboratories. The participants used various measurement methods, though many of them used ICP-AES. Generally speaking, the agreement of the results was very good for each measurand.</p><p>Main text.
