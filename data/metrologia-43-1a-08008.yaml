abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K34 was organized jointly by the inorganic and electrochemistry working groups of the CCQM as a follow-up to the pilot study CCQM-P36 to test the abilities of the metrology institutes to measure the amount content of acid in solid weak acids. The Slovak Institute of Metrology acted as the coordinating laboratory, and seven NMIs expressed interest in participation. All participants used constant current coulometry at different levels of sophistication. In general very good agreement of the results was observed; some possible problems were highlighted.</p><p>Main text.
