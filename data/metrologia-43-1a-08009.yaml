    <p>CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub> are the global warming chemicals that are used in semiconductor companies. In the Kyoto protocol on climate change in 1997, those chemicals were included in the items for which quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments were required. Accordingly for the measurement of these gases, it is necessary that measurement results are accurate and traceable, in particular because of the fact that CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub> are global warming source gases.</p>
    <p>This part of the project focuses on a comparison of measurement capability for measuring CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub> at emission level. This key comparison will cover the comparability of the gas CRMs at the emission level (10  × 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/mol – 100 mmol/mol in nitrogen or air) of the following chemicals: CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub> and NF<sub>3</sub>.</p>
    <p>There is good agreement between the results of the key comparison participants in this comparison for both CF<sub>4</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>. The results for CF<sub>4</sub> agree within 0.5% relative, and for SF<sub>6</sub> they agree within 0.1% relative. Even though the concentration is as low as 100 µmol/mol, the comparability between participants on gravimetric preparation plus comparison analysis is excellent for the laboratories that are participating in this key comparison.</p>
