    <p>In this key comparison anion calibration solutions of chloride and phosphate were investigated. The contents of both solutions were about 1 g/kg relative to the anion mass. For the chloride comparison 10 participants provided results by the following three analytical techniques: coulometry, titrimetry and ion chromatography. The phosphate amount content was determined by 10 NMIs whereby the following 6 techniques were applied: ion chromatography, titrimetry, ICP-OES, gravimetry, UV-Vis and ion-exchange followed by coulometry. The following institutes participated in this key comparison:

    With one exception all results were found within the range of ±0.25% with respect to the gravimetric value. The variability (RSD) of the results is below 0.1% for both the chloride and the phosphate solution (chloride without CENAM result). Compared to the pilot study  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/08007">CCQM-P32</ext-link> the results of CCQM-K29 were significantly better. This is especially true for the phosphate comparison.</p>
