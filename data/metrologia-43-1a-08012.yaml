    <p>In this key comparison anion calibration solutions of chloride and phosphate were investigated. The contents of both solutions were about 1 g/kg relative to the anion mass. For the chloride comparison 10 participants provided results by the following three analytical techniques: coulometry, titrimetry and ion chromatography. The phosphate amount content was determined by 10 NMIs whereby the following 6 techniques were applied: ion chromatography, titrimetry, ICP-OES, gravimetry, UV-Vis and ion-exchange followed by coulometry. The following institutes participated in this key comparison:<p>BAM and PTB (Germany)</p><p>BNM-LNE (France)</p><p>CENAM (Mexico)</p><p>EMPA (Switzerland)</p><p>GUM (Poland)</p><p>INTEC (Chile)</p><p>KRISS (Korea)</p><p>NMIJ (Japan)</p><p>NRCCRM (China)</p><p>SMU (Slovakia)</p>

    With one exception all results were found within the range of ±0.25% with respect to the gravimetric value. The variability (RSD) of the results is below 0.1% for both the chloride and the phosphate solution (chloride without CENAM result). Compared to the pilot study CCQM-P32 the results of CCQM-K29 were significantly better. This is especially true for the phosphate comparison.</p><p>Main text.
