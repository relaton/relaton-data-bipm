    <p>In the key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/08012">CCQM-K29</ext-link> on Anion calibration solutions, carried out in 2003/4, the CENAM chloride result was found to be an outlier. The reason for this was identified and the procedure corrected. The subsequent bilateral key comparison CCQM-K29.1 between CENAM and SMU was carried out in order to confirm improved CENAM performance in the analysis of chloride calibration solution. The mass fraction of chloride was the same as that in CCQM-K29 (about 1  g/kg). The CENAM result agrees well with the reference value based on preparation.</p>
