    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K19 was carried out to demonstrate the capability of the interested national metrology institutes to measure the pH value of an unknown borate buffer by a primary method. The buffer of nominal pH ~ 9.17 was measured at 15 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C. The pilot study CCQM-P82 was performed in parallel in order to allow interested laboratories, mainly newcomers in this field, to compare their capabilities to the more advanced NMI using the same batch of sample.</p><p>The comparison was an activity of the Electrochemical Working Group (EAWG) of the CCQM and was coordinated by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany.</p><p>All participants applied the primary method for pH [1]. The result for the unknown buffer solution is the acidity function at zero chloride molality, pa<sup>0</sup>.</p><p>Good agreement of the results was observed for the majorities of participants. The Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) was agreed upon during the EAWG meeting in Berlin in October 2005 as the median of the reported results. Accordingly the Statements of Equivalence were calculated.</p><p>Main text.
