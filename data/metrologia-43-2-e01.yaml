abstract:
- content: "<p>The ninth NEWRAD Conference was held in Davos, Switzerland, between
    16 and 19 October 2005. The Conference was organized by the Physikalisch- Meteorologisches
    Observatorium Davos, World Radiation Center (PMOD/WRC). The Conference was attended
    by 169 participants from five continents, which makes it the largest NEWRAD conference
    to date. The NEWRAD Conference followed the 10th international pyrheliometer comparison
    IPC-X, which is held every five years at PMOD/WRC. In addition, the 6th UVnet
    Workshop was held in connection with the NEWRAD Conference on 20 and 21 October.</p><p>The
    NEWRAD Conference brings together people from the national metrology institutes
    and the principal user communities of advanced radiometry, including meteorological
    and remote-sensing communities. A total of 153 papers were presented, of which
    eight were keynote or invited talks, and there were 105 posters. Coffee breaks
    and extended lunch breaks created a stimulating atmosphere for lively discussions
    and exchange of ideas. Notwithstanding the excellent weather and the tantalizing
    surroundings of Davos, most participants managed to attend the poster sessions,
    which were organized during the noon lunch breaks.</p><p>The conference proceedings
    can be downloaded from the NEWRAD 2005 website at  www.pmodwrc.ch/newrad2005/pdfabstracts/Newrad_Proceedings_2005_A7.pdf.
    For this and future conferences, a new policy was adopted to publish a selected
    number of contributions in a special issue of  Metrologia. The purpose of the
    change is to increase the overall impact of this journal. The NEWRAD Scientific
    Committee invited the contributions to this special issue on the basis of the
    quality of the extended abstracts, and later the submitted manuscripts were reviewed
    by the Committee members.</p><p>On behalf of the Scientific Committee and all
    the participants, one of us (EI) wishes to thank Werner Schmutz and his colleagues
    from the Local Organizing Committee for arranging an excellent conference in the
    beautiful city of Davos. As the new Chairman of the Scientific Committee, he also
    acknowledges the valuable contributions of the previous Chairman, Andrew Wallard,
    in leading the work of the Committee.</p><p>The next NEWRAD Conference will be
    organized by the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) on
    13–17 October 2008. We are grateful to Dr In-Won Lee for his invitation to arrange
    NEWRAD 2008 at KRISS. Dr Lee can be contacted by e-mail at optin@kriss.re.kr.</p>"
