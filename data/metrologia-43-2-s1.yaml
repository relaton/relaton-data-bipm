abstract:
- content: "<p>Nearly 20 years ago Quinn and Martin presented a novel blackbody design
    with an absorbing end face and highly reflecting side walls. This blackbody had
    the considerable advantage of being less sensitive to temperature gradients along
    the side walls (potentially of several degrees Celsius) compared with an all-black
    cavity. Recent work at NPL has developed this concept further, laying out the
    conceptual framework in simple terms, analysing potential pitfalls such as diffraction
    and describing designs which closely match the theoretical best performance.</p>"
