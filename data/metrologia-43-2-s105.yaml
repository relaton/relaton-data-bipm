  content: "<p>The paper describes both basic and additional procedures for absolute
    calibration of optical-electronic instrumentation made with the help of synchrotron
    radiation (SR) sources in the spectral range from 0.25 nm to 122 nm (from 5000 eV
    to 10 eV). The procedures perform absolute calibration of the Space Solar Patrol
    instrumentation, created to monitor the ionizing radiation from the Sun in the
    spectral range from 0.14 nm to 198 nm. The fulfilment of this task is closely
    connected with the development of the SR-based metrological stations on the VEPP-3
    and VEPP-4 storage rings (Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP), Novosibirsk,
    Russia). The paper also considers the basic requirements for the absolute spectral
    measurements.</p>"
