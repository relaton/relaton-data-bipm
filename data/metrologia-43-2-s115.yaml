  content: "<p>The establishment of a relative spectral responsivity scale requires
    the availability of a detector with a relative spectral responsivity which can
    be measured or estimated. NPL has addressed this requirement by designing a new
    detector with a measurable relative spectral response profile in the 800 nm to
    24 µm wavelength range. The new detector is based on a large area pyroelectric
    detector enclosed in a removable gold-coated hemispherical reflector. A number
    of these cavity pyroelectric detectors were fabricated and three have been selected
    and are currently being used as the primary standards for the establishment of
    the NPL relative spectral responsivity scale in the infrared region. This paper
    summarizes the design and performance characteristics of these cavity pyroelectric
    detectors and demonstrates how they are used to establish the NPL relative spectral
    responsivity scales in the 0.8 µm to 24 µm wavelength range.</p>"
