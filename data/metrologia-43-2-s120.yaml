abstract:
- content: "<p>A method for the determination of the effective measurement plane of
    spectroradiometer diffusers at various wavelength regions is described. The method
    is based on the inverse-square law of the distance dependence of the measured
    signal. The scheme is tested with three planar and one dome-shaped spectroradiometer
    diffuser at four wavelength bands. The distance offsets of the diffusers determined
    in the UVA region are from 0 mm to 2.1 mm for the planar diffusers and 6.4 mm
    for the dome diffuser, whereas the corresponding values in the NIR region are
    from 0 mm to 7.7 mm and 8.2 mm. The uncertainties of the measured reference plane
    positions of the diffusers are estimated to be 0.3 mm. If the reference plane
    position is not properly taken into account in calibration measurements with lamps,
    large systematic errors may appear when measuring radiation from distant sources.
    We also investigate the wavelength dependence of the angular responsivity of the
    diffusers. A clear correlation appears between the wavelength dependences of the
    distance offsets and the angular responsivity curves.</p>"
