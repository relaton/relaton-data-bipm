abstract:
- content: "<p>The reproducibility of high-temperature metal–carbon fixed-points has
    been investigated. Crucibles and metals from the National Physical Laboratory
    were used to construct fixed-points using the facilities of the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan. The reproducibility at 2747 K was 25 mK, with a comparison
    uncertainty of 112 mK (k = 2). Appropriate construction methodology should permit
    this level of reproducibility between cells made at different national measurement
    institutes.</p>"
