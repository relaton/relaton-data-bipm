  content: "<p>The reproducibility of high-temperature metal–carbon fixed-points has
    been investigated. Crucibles and metals from the National Physical Laboratory
    were used to construct fixed-points using the facilities of the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan. The reproducibility at 2747 K was 25 mK, with a comparison
    uncertainty of 112 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2). Appropriate construction methodology
    should permit this level of reproducibility between cells made at different national
    measurement institutes.</p>"
