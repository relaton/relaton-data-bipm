abstract:
- content: "<p>Metal (carbide)–carbon eutectic fixed points when applied to radiometry
    should operate at a temperature preferably exceeding 3000 K, have a large aperture,
    be robust and have long plateau duration. The large-tube-diameter BB3500YY furnace,
    recently introduced at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), has been
    tuned for such fixed-point realization. A novel cell structure with an internal
    insulation of highly purified carbon-composite sheet material was designed and
    tested. This resulted in improved robustness, immunity to furnace temperature
    nonuniformity and extended plateau duration. The design was applied to a hyper-eutectic
    porous ingot cell, and a reproducible plateau was observed. Preliminary results
    for a large aperture cell with an aperture diameter of 8 mm are also reported.</p>"
