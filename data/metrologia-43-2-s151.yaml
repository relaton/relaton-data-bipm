abstract:
- content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA is participating
    in a project with the American Water Works Association Research Foundation (AwwaRF)
    to develop new guidelines for ultraviolet (UV) sensor characteristics to monitor
    the performance of UV water disinfection plants. The current UV water disinfection
    standards, Ã–NORM M5873-1 and M5873-2 (Austria) and DVGW W294 3 (Germany), on the
    requirements for UV sensors for low-pressure mercury (LPM) and medium-pressure
    mercury (MPM) lamp systems have been studied. Additionally, the characteristics
    of various types of UV sensors from several different commercial vendors have
    been measured and analysed. This information will aid in the development of new
    guidelines to address issues such as sensor requirements, calibration methods,
    uncertainty and traceability. Practical problems were found in the calibration
    methods and evaluation of spectral responsivity requirements for sensors designed
    for MPM lamp systems. To solve the problems, NIST is proposing an alternative
    sensor calibration method for MPM lamp systems. A future calibration service is
    described for UV sensors intended for low- and medium-pressure mercury lamp systems
    used in water disinfection applications.</p>"
