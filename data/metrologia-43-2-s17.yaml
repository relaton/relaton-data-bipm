abstract:
- content: "<p>With the advent of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) it is becoming
    increasingly important to understand the response of solid-state photodiodes to
    pulsed radiation where the peak power incident on the device may be quite high
    even when the average power is modest. The high peak power causes the photodiode
    signal to saturate and can create errors in the measurement of pulse energy unless
    the saturation effect is corrected. We have used 532 nm radiation from a frequency-doubled,
    Q-switched Nd : YAG laser as a proxy for the 13.5 nm radiation used in EUVL and
    have studied the saturation behaviour of Si photodiodes at peak power densities
    from less than 0.1 W mm<sup>−2</sup> to over 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> W mm<sup>−2</sup>.
    Here we test a previously reported model of saturation at pulse lengths from 8 ns
    to 1 µs and examine the effect of power density (illumination area) on the saturation
    behaviour. The saturation parameters measured at 532 nm are used as inputs to
    the model, and the calibration of a filter radiometer in pulsed 13.5 nm radiation
    is corrected for saturation effects. The corrected result agrees with the value
    expected from individual component calibrations, but the uncorrected data differ
    by more than the combined uncertainty. This result supports the hypothesis that
    532 nm radiation is a valid proxy for 13.5 nm radiation when studying saturation
    behaviour. Finally, we derive quantitative limits imposed by the saturation effects
    on the use of Si photodiodes in EUVL applications.</p>"
