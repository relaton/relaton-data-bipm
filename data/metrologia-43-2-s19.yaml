abstract:
- content: "<p>The international Global Earth Observation System of Systems is at
    its initial stage. We present some general information about the program and formulate
    the task of ensuring the uniformity of radiometric measurements to be conducted
    by all the participating national systems. Methods of solving the task are suggested
    on the basis of the wide application of standard sources that use phase transition
    of eutectic alloys and pure metals as well as with the help of improved ground
    calibration facilities.</p>"
