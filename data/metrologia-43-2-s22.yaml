abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the establishment of the International Temperature Scale of 1990
    (ITS-90), much progress has been made in the development of radiometers and blackbody
    sources. Cryogenic electrical-substitution radiometry is widely used in detector
    and radiometer calibrations, and stable, high-temperature metalâ€“carbon eutectic
    blackbodies are under development. Radiation thermometers can be calibrated for
    absolute radiance responsivity, and blackbody temperatures determined from the
    amount of optical power without the use of any fixed points to directly measure
    thermodynamic temperatures. These thermodynamic temperatures can be measured with
    lower final uncertainties than the ITS-90 derived temperatures, and these developments
    will directly impact future international temperature scales.</p>"
