abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method is described for comparing calibration facilities for
    broadband ultraviolet (UV) meters. The method is validated in a successful pilot
    comparison between five European laboratories performing UVA irradiance responsivity
    calibrations. Participating laboratories calibrated a broadband UVA detector using
    their ordinary procedures that differed both by calibration methods and radiation
    sources used. The pilot laboratory calculated different reference values for each
    laboratory based on the specified calibration methods and prior knowledge of the
    calibrated artefact. The results were in agreement within ±5%, which demonstrates
    a factor of two improvement in the consistency of the results as compared with
    earlier intercomparisons.</p>"
