abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe the concept of modularity and versatility in the construction
    of a new cryogenic radiometer developed at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology. We address the benefits of the modular design in the construction
    and development and discuss some of the device characterizations and results of
    a cryogenic radiometer intercomparison.</p>"
