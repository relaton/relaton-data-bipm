  content: "<p>Photoluminescent properties of white reference materials commonly used
    as spectral diffuse reflectance standards were studied in the near-UV to visible
    region. Spectroscopic analysis based on a two-monochromator method revealed that
    most of white reference materials produced photoluminescence upon exposure not
    only to near-UV and UV radiation but also to visible radiation shorter than 400 nm.
    Remarkable differences in the photoluminescence spectrum and intensity were observed
    between different types of white materials, which would suggest that each material
    has a specific origin of photoluminescence. Although most of the photoluminescence
    observed in this study was slight except for some kinds of opal glasses and ceramic
    tiles, it would cause a relatively large error in spectral diffuse reflectance
    measurements, depending on the measurement conditions such as the spectral responsivity
    of detector systems.</p>"
