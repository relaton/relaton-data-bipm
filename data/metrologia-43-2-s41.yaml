abstract:
- content: "<p>The Low Background Infrared calibration facility at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing an instrument to measure the
    relative areas of apertures with diameters ranging from 5 mm to 0.05 mm. NIST
    already has the capability of determining the absolute area of apertures with
    diameters larger than 0.35 mm. Our goal is to measure the area or radius of a
    0.05 mm diameter aperture to a standard uncertainty of better than 0.1%. We report
    on the current status of this effort and plans for improvement. We are near the
    goal for apertures larger than 0.350 mm.</p>"
