  content: "<p>The Low Background Infrared (LBIR) facility at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has performed ten radiance temperature calibrations
    of low-background blackbodies since 2001, when both the calibration facility and
    method of calibrating blackbodies were significantly improved. Data from nine
    of these blackbody calibrations are presented, showing a surprisingly large spread
    in blackbody performance. While some blackbodies performed relatively well, in
    no case did the measured radiance temperature agree with the temperature sensors
    in the blackbody core to within 0.3 K over the entire operating temperature range
    of the blackbody. Of the nine blackbodies reported, five showed temperature errors
    greater than 1 K at some point in their operating temperature range. The various
    sources of uncertainty, such as optical geometry and detector standard uncertainty,
    are presented with examples to support the stated calibration accuracy. Generic
    blackbody cavity design features, such as cavity thermal mass, cavity volume and
    defining aperture placement are discussed and correlated with blackbody performance.
    Data are also presented on the performance of the absolute cryogenic radiometers
    (ACRs) that are used as detector standards in the calibration of blackbodies.
    Recent intercomparisons of all the LBIR ACRs with a trap detector calibrated against
    the NIST primary optical power measurement standard show that ACRs used to calibrate
    blackbodies are suitable detector standards and contribute less than 0.02% uncertainty
    (<italic>k</italic> = 1) to radiance temperature measurements of the blackbody
    cavities.</p>"
