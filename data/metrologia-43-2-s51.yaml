abstract:
- content: "<p>Photoconductive diamond detectors consisting of highly oriented film
    were characterized in temporal response, spectral responsivity and its spatial
    uniformity as a candidate for FUV/VUV transfer standard detectors. The results
    showed that the diamond detectors have superior stability under 172 nm irradiation
    but need to be improved for better carrier collection efficiency, uniformity and
    temporal response. The slow temporal response and the non-zero spectral responsivity
    below the band-gap photon energy strongly suggest the presence of long lifetime
    carrier traps. A strong correlation was found between the average facet size observed
    by SEM and the spatial responsivity, suggesting that defects in the grain boundaries
    are the origin of the traps. The spectral responsivity measurements revealed that
    the photoemission current contribution to the total output current is almost dominant
    in the wavelength range from 40 nm to 60 nm.</p>"
