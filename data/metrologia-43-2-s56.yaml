  content: "<p>We explore the feasibility of using high conversion-efficiency periodically-poled
    crystals to produce photon pairs for photon-counting detector calibrations at
    1550 nm. The goal is the development of an appropriate parametric down-conversion
    (PDC) source at telecom wavelengths meeting the requirements of high-efficiency
    pair production and collection in single spectral and spatial modes (single-mode
    fibres). We propose a protocol to optimize the photon collection, noise levels
    and the uncertainty evaluation. This study ties together the results of our efforts
    to model the single-mode heralding efficiency of a two-photon PDC source and to
    estimate the heralding uncertainty of such a source.</p>"
