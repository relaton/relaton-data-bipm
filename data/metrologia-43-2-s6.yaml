abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate measurements of the radiant power and other quantities are
    a prerequisite for the development and optimization of suitable radiation sources
    for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Photodiodes are established as easy-to-operate
    detectors also in the EUV range. The calibrations at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt are based on the comparison of the detector to be calibrated with
    the cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer as a primary detector standard
    using monochromatized synchrotron radiation at the soft x-ray radiometry beamline
    in the spectral range from 1 nm up to 25 nm. The spectral responsivity is measured
    with a relative uncertainty of 0.3% or better. For the dissemination of these
    high-accuracy calibrations, we investigated the stability and linearity of silicon
    n-on-p junction photodiodes under intense EUV irradiation in ultra-high vacuum.
    The maximum current in linear operation (1% relative saturation) depends on the
    size of the photon beam and ranges from about 3 mA for a 6 mm photon beam diameter
    to 0.2 mA for a 0.25 mm diameter spot. Diodes with diamond-like carbon or a TiSiN
    top layer proved to be stable up to a radiant exposure of about 100 kJ cm<sup>−2</sup>.
    Furthermore, examples of the calibration of spectrally and spatially resolving
    radiometric tools for EUV-source characterization are presented.</p>"
