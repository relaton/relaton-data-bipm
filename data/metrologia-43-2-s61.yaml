  content: "<p>We describe a Calibrated Hyperspectral Image Projector (CHIP) intended
    for radiometric testing of instruments ranging from complex hyperspectral or multispectral
    imagers to simple filter radiometers. The CHIP, based on the same digital mirror
    arrays used in commercial Digital Light Processing (DLP) displays, is capable
    of projecting any combination of as many as approximately one hundred different
    arbitrarily programmable basis spectra per frame into each pixel of the instrument
    under test (IUT). The resulting spectral and spatial content of the image entering
    the IUT can simulate, at typical video frame rates and integration times, realistic
    scenes to which the IUT will be exposed during use, and its spectral radiance
    can be calibrated with a spectroradiometer. Use of such generated scenes in a
    controlled laboratory setting would alleviate expensive field testing, allow better
    separation of environmental effects from instrumental effects and enable system-level
    performance testing and validation of space-flight instruments prior to launch.
    Example applications are system-level testing of complex hyperspectral imaging
    instruments and algorithms with realistic scenes and testing the performance of
    first-responder cameras under simulated adverse conditions. We have built and
    tested a successful prototype of the spectral engine, a primary component of the
    CHIP, that generates arbitrary, programmable spectra in the 1000 nm to 2500 nm
    spectral range. We have also built a spectral engine operating at visible wavelengths
    to be discussed in a separate publication. Here we present an overview of this
    technology and its applications and discuss experimental performance results of
    our prototype infrared spectral engine.</p>"
