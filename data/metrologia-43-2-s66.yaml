  content: "<p>With the transportable reference spectroradiometer QASUME (Quality
    Assurance of Spectral Ultraviolet Measurements in Europe) routine quality assurance
    of spectrally resolved solar ultraviolet irradiance measurements were successfully
    performed at 25 UV monitoring sites in Europe. The absolute scale carried by the
    QASUME reference spectroradiometer is traceable to the primary irradiance standard
    of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Braunschweig, Germany, and
    has proved to represent the average scale in use at 25 independent European laboratories;
    it can thus be taken as a European irradiance reference. Out of the 27 instruments
    13 showed deviations relative to the QASUME reference spectroradiometer of less
    than 4% in the UVB (15 instruments in the UVA) for solar zenith angles below 75°.
    The results so far have shown the unique possibilities offered by this transportable
    reference spectroradiometer for providing on-site quality assurance of solar ultraviolet
    irradiance measurements.</p>"
