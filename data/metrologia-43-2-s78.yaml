  content: "<p>Thermodynamic temperatures during the melt and the freeze of Co–C,
    Pd–C, Pt–C and Ru–C metal–carbon fixed-point cells manufactured by LNE–INM/CNAM,
    NMIJ and NPL were determined by absolutely calibrated filter radiometers traceable
    to the PTB cryogenic radiometer and a radiance comparison method using an IKE
    LP3 radiation thermometer. The measurement uncertainties were below 400 mK at
    temperatures up to 2250 K. The results are in agreement within the combined uncertainties
    with a study on relative temperature differences of the same set of fixed-point
    cells. For the fixed-point cells manufactured by NPL the results are compared
    with a previous thermodynamic temperature measurement.</p>"
