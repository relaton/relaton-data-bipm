  content: "<p>A general concept is presented to realize the traceability of fluorescence
    measurements to radiometric units based on a combination of suited physical and
    chemical transfer standards and a reference fluorometer as a linking unit. The
    standards comprise a newly designed spectral radiance transfer standard more closely
    adapted to the spectral radiance of typical fluorescent samples than conventional
    standard lamps and a set of easy-to-operate spectral fluorescence standards consisting
    of organic dyes. An example is given as to how the comparability of fluorescence
    spectra across instruments can be improved. Finally, the design and the calibration
    scheme of a new reference fluorometer is presented which is designed for the performance
    of relative and absolute fluorescence measurements with minimum uncertainty.</p>"
