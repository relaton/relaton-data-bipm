  content: "<p>The CCPR K1-a key comparison of spectral irradiance (from 250 nm to
    2500 nm) was carried out to meet the requirements of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    by 13 participating national metrology institutes. Because of the fragile nature
    of the tungsten halogen lamps used as comparison artefacts the comparison was
    arranged as a star comparison with many more lamps than participants. The National
    Physical Laboratory (UK) piloted the comparison and, by measuring all lamps, provided
    a link between participants' measurements. The comparison was analysed using a
    model-based method, which ensured that all participants, including the pilot,
    were treated equitably. This paper presents the comparison philosophy, methodology,
    analysis and results.</p>"
