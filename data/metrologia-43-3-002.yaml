abstract:
- content: "<p>Weighted mean has been used to combine means from several sets of measurements,
    which are either from different laboratories or based on different measurement
    methods. It is also often used in key comparisons and other inter-laboratory comparisons.
    However, the traditional estimator of the variance of the weighted mean underestimates
    the variance. Two new variance estimators are proposed with smaller biases, smaller
    mean square errors and much better coverage probabilities for the correspondingly
    formed intervals. In metrology, the uncertainties based on Type B evaluation which
    are not based on statistical analysis of data cannot be ignored. In the later
    part of this paper, the results are extended to the general case with both Type
    A and Type B uncertainty components being presented.</p>"
