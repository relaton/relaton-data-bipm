abstract:
- content: "<p>NIST standard reference materials (SRMs) are certified reference materials
    that are developed at NIST and provided to laboratories (industry, government
    and academia) for assessment and improvement of measurement quality. This paper
    details the statistical analysis related to the recertification of SRM 1508a,
    benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) in freeze-dried urine, to incorporate new
    data. The recertification is based on combining measurement results from different
    measurement methods and time periods. Several different statistical models and
    corresponding estimators were considered for the certified value, its standard
    uncertainty and its expanded uncertainty.</p>"
