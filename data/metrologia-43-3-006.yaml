abstract:
- content: "<p>The International System of Units (SI) is founded on seven base units,
    the metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela corresponding to
    the seven base quantities of length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic
    temperature, amount of substance and luminous intensity. At its 94th meeting in
    October 2005, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) adopted
    a recommendation on preparative steps towards redefining the kilogram, ampere,
    kelvin and mole so that these units are linked to exactly known values of fundamental
    constants. We propose here that these four base units should be given new definitions
    linking them to exactly defined values of the Planck constant h, elementary charge
    e, Boltzmann constant k and Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub>, respectively. This
    would mean that six of the seven base units of the SI would be defined in terms
    of true invariants of nature. In addition, not only would these four fundamental
    constants have exactly defined values but also the uncertainties of many of the
    other fundamental constants of physics would be either eliminated or appreciably
    reduced. In this paper we present the background and discuss the merits of these
    proposed changes, and we also present possible wordings for the four new definitions.
    We also suggest a novel way to define the entire SI explicitly using such definitions
    without making any distinction between base units and derived units. We list a
    number of key points that should be addressed when the new definitions are adopted
    by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), possibly by the 24th
    CGPM in 2011, and we discuss the implications of these changes for other aspects
    of metrology.</p>"
