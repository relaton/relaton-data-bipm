abstract:
- content: "<p>The quantity to be measured in dosimetry for radiation therapy is the
    absorbed dose to water,  D<sub>w</sub>. At the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    a water calorimeter is established as the primary standard for  D<sub>w</sub>
    in<sup>60</sup>Co radiation under reference conditions. The water calorimeter
    is capable of measuring the absorbed dose to water with a combined standard uncertainty
    of 0.20%. Some aspects of the design and operation of the water calorimeter are
    discussed. Detailed experimental and theoretical investigations for the different
    influence quantities affecting the calorimetric results are presented.</p>"
