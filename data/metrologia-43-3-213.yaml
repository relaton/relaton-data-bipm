abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents the class of the L<sub>p</sub> (least power) estimators
    and their main properties. Particular estimators belonging to such a class are
    well known in metrology, like the sample median, the sample mean and the mid-range
    (that is the L<sub>p</sub> estimator with p = 1, 2, âˆž, respectively), whereas
    the L<sub>p</sub> estimator with generic p is not yet applied within the metrological
    context. Thanks to robustness and efficiency properties intermediate between those
    of the sample mean and the sample median, the L<sub>p</sub> estimator with 1 &lt;
    p &lt; 2 (in particular, with p = 1.5) appears suitable for the statistical processing
    of experimental results. Application examples of the L<sub>p</sub> estimator to
    international intercomparison data processing are reported.</p>"
