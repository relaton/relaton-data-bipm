  content: "<p>Three statistical distributions have been tested as candidates to represent
    the uncertainty of complex-valued quantities in Monte Carlo measurement uncertainty
    calculations. Two candidates are Bayesian multivariate <italic>t</italic>-distributions
    with ‘non-informative’ priors. The other is the distribution of a ‘generalized
    pivotal quantity’ (GPQ) for a multivariate mean. The best performance observed
    was from the GPQ: the two multivariate <italic>t</italic>-distributions were unsatisfactory
    in terms of coverage. The testing methodology is general and can be used to check
    the validity of other uncertainty calculation procedures.</p>"
