abstract:
- content: "<p>Three statistical distributions have been tested as candidates to represent
    the uncertainty of complex-valued quantities in Monte Carlo measurement uncertainty
    calculations. Two candidates are Bayesian multivariate t-distributions with ‘non-informative’
    priors. The other is the distribution of a ‘generalized pivotal quantity’ (GPQ)
    for a multivariate mean. The best performance observed was from the GPQ: the two
    multivariate t-distributions were unsatisfactory in terms of coverage. The testing
    methodology is general and can be used to check the validity of other uncertainty
    calculation procedures.</p>"
