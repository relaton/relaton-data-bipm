  content: "<p>We determined the zero-density viscosity \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    and thermal conductivity \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    of argon with a standard uncertainty of 0.084% in the temperature range 200 K
    to 400 K. This uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of helium's viscosity
    \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in003.gif\"></inline-graphic>, which
    we estimate to be 0.080% based upon the difference between <italic>ab initio</italic>
    and experimental values at 298.15 K. Our results may improve (1) the argon–argon
    interatomic potential, (2) calculated boundary-layer corrections for primary acoustic
    thermometry, and (3) calibrations of laminar flow meters as well as instruments
    for measuring transport properties. At 298.15 K, we determined the ratio \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro220113in004.gif\"></inline-graphic> from measurements of the
    flow rate of these gases through a quartz capillary while simultaneously measuring
    the pressures at the ends of the capillary. Between 200 K and 400 K, we used a
    two-capillary viscometer to determine \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in005.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    with an uncertainty of 0.024%. From \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in006.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    we computed \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    using the values of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in003.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    calculated <italic>ab initio</italic>. Finally, we computed the thermal conductivity
    of argon from \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro220113in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    and values of the Prandtl number that we computed from argon–argon interatomic
    potentials.</p>"
