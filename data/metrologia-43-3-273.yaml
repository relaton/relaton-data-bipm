abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes a study of the melting point of gallium with the
    new NIM Johnson noise thermometer (JNT). The new thermometer adopts the structure
    of switching correlator and commutator with the reference resistor maintained
    at the triple point of water. The electronic system of the new thermometer is
    basically the same as the current JNT, but the preamplifiers have been improved
    slightly. This study demonstrates that examining the characteristics of the noise
    signals in the frequency domain is of critical importance in constructing an improved
    new thermometer, where a power spectral analysis is found to be critical in establishing
    appropriate grounding for the new thermometer. The new JNT is tested on measurements
    of the thermodynamic temperature of the melting point of gallium, which give the
    thermodynamic temperature of 302.9160 K, with an overall integration time of 190 h
    and a combined standard uncertainty of 9.4 mK. The uncertainty analysis indicates
    that a standard combined uncertainty of 3 mK could be achieved with the new thermometer
    over an integration period of 1750 h.</p>"
