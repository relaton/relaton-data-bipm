abstract:
- content: "<p>This work presents a study of the determination of uncertainties in
    [UTC − UTC(k)] needed for publication in the Bureau Inernational des Poids et
    Mesures's (BIPM's) Circular T and the Key Comparison Database, as required by
    the Mutual Recognition Arrangement. In the first part of the paper, an analytical
    solution based on the law of the propagation of uncertainty is derived. In the
    second part, the solution is verified numerically using the software used by the
    BIPM for the generation of UTC.</p>"
