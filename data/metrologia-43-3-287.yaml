  content: "<p>A methodology to achieve spectral thermal radiance measurements from
    space with demonstrable on-orbit traceability to the International System of Units
    (SI) is described. This technique results in measurements of infrared spectral
    radiance \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro223087in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    with spectral index \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro223087in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    in cm<sup>−1</sup>, with a relative combined uncertainty \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro223087in003.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    of 0.0015 (<italic>k</italic> = 1) for the average mid-infrared radiance emitted
    by the Earth. This combined uncertainty, expressed in brightness temperature units,
    is equivalent to ±0.1 K at 250 K at 750 cm<sup>−1</sup>. This measurement goal
    is achieved by utilizing a new method for infrared scale realization combined
    with an instrument design optimized to minimize component uncertainties and admit
    tests of radiometric performance. The SI traceability of the instrument scale
    is established by evaluation against source-based and detector-based infrared
    scales in defined laboratory protocols before launch. A novel strategy is executed
    to ensure fidelity of on-orbit calibration to the pre-launch scale. This strategy
    for on-orbit validation relies on the overdetermination of instrument calibration.
    The pre-launch calibration against scales derived from physically independent
    paths to the base SI units provides the foundation for a critical analysis of
    the overdetermined on-orbit calibration to establish an SI-traceable estimate
    of the combined measurement uncertainty. Redundant calibration sources and built-in
    diagnostic tests to assess component measurement uncertainties verify the SI traceability
    of the instrument calibration over the mission lifetime. This measurement strategy
    can be realized by a practical instrument, a prototype Fourier-transform spectrometer
    under development for deployment on a small satellite. The measurement record
    resulting from the methodology described here meets the observational requirements
    for climate monitoring and climate model testing and improvement.</p>"
