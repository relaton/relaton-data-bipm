abstract:
- content: "<p>The frequency of several hyperfine components of<sup>127</sup>I<sub>2</sub>
    has been measured at 514.67 nm using an optical frequency comb. Among them, the
    a<sub>3</sub> component of the P(13)43-0 transition is recommended by the CIPM
    for the practical realization of the definition of the metre. The result is consistent
    with other measurements of the same line within 1.5 kHz of uncertainty, when the
    collisional shift is taken into account. A frequency-doubled distributed feedback
    fibre laser has been developed to carry out these measurements.</p>"
