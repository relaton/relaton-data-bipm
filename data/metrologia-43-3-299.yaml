  content: "<p>We propose an alternative scheme for preparing a standard light-emitting
    diode (LED) for luminous intensity or total luminous flux measurements, which
    differs from the conventional approach by an advanced seasoning method. Our method
    for seasoning, referred to as ‘functional seasoning’, gives quantitative information
    on the temperature dependence and the ageing effect of the LED emission by simultaneously
    recording the photometric quantity to be specified and the junction voltage. Based
    on a theoretical model, we demonstrate experimentally the method by using a fully
    automated LED seasoning system to measure the luminous intensity and the junction
    voltage of 12 LEDs simultaneously. By independent measurements of the temperature
    dependence, we confirm the discrepancy of the theoretical model to be less than
    0.5% and evaluate the total uncertainty contribution of the functional seasoning
    to be less than 0.5% for all the tested samples. As a result, the standard LEDs
    of four different colours (white, red, green and blue) could be prepared for a
    seasoning time of only 70 h, which can be applied in specified conditions: for
    example, for a temperature of (25 ± 5) °C and for a burning time of 20 h without
    any active temperature control.</p>"
