abstract:
- content: "<p>The national metrology institutes and their partners participating
    in EUROMET Project 463 developed finite element methods (FEM) for calculation
    of the pressure distortion coefficients, including their uncertainties, of pressure
    balances operated at pressures up to 1 GPa and applied them to a PTB 1 GPa piston–cylinder
    assembly. The methods use axisymmetric models developed and analysed on the basis
    of the experimental data including the elastic properties of the piston–cylinder
    materials, pressure-dependent density and viscosity of the pressure-transmitting
    fluid, dimensions of the piston and cylinder and the piston–cylinder clearance
    as well as the conditions at the piston–cylinder boundaries. Results such as pressure
    distributions and radial distortions along the piston–cylinder engagement length,
    pressure distortion coefficients and their uncertainties as well as piston fall
    rates dependent on pressure are presented for the free deformation (FD) and the
    controlled-clearance operating modes of the assembly. The theoretical results
    are verified by comparing them with the distortion coefficients determined by
    an experimental method and with the jacket pressure distortion coefficients. The
    participants' results demonstrate good agreement of the distortion coefficients
    up to 1 GPa but rather large differences in the uncertainties of the distortion
    coefficients as well as in the pressure distributions, gap profiles and piston
    fall rate at maximum pressure. The FEM distortion coefficients obtained for the
    real piston–cylinder gap profile are in good agreement with the coefficients determined
    by the experimental method; the FEM values obtained for the ideal gap agree well
    with the distortion coefficients furnished by the simplified theory. For the real
    gap model, the uncertainty of the gap geometry is the main uncertainty source.
    The total standard uncertainties of the controlled-clearance distortion coefficient
    obtained by different methods lie between (0.078 and 0.17) × 10<sup>−6</sup> MPa<sup>−1</sup>
    at 400 MPa and between (0.04 and 0.098) × 10<sup>−6</sup> MPa<sup>−1</sup> at
    1 GPa.</p>"
