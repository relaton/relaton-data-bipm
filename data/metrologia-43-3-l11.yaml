  content: <p>A recent evaluation of the accuracy of the National Physical Laboratory
    (NPL) primary frequency standard NPL-CsF1 by K Szymaniec <italic>et al</italic>
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/42/1/007">2005
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>42</bold> 49–57</ext-link>) reported an overall
    frequency uncertainty of δν/ν<sub>0</sub> = 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup>. This stated
    uncertainty includes a correction of a frequency bias of δν/ν<sub>0</sub> = 8
    × 10<sup>−16</sup> ± 3 × 10<sup>−16</sup> attributed by the authors to microwave
    leakage. We believe that the stated cause of the frequency bias, its magnitude
    and its stated uncertainty are in error.</p>
