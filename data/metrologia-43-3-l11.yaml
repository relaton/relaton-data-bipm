abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent evaluation of the accuracy of the National Physical Laboratory
    (NPL) primary frequency standard NPL-CsF1 by K Szymaniec et al (2005 Metrologia
    42 49–57) reported an overall frequency uncertainty of δν/ν<sub>0</sub> = 1 ×
    10<sup>−15</sup>. This stated uncertainty includes a correction of a frequency
    bias of δν/ν<sub>0</sub> = 8 × 10<sup>−16</sup> ± 3 × 10<sup>−16</sup> attributed
    by the authors to microwave leakage. We believe that the stated cause of the frequency
    bias, its magnitude and its stated uncertainty are in error.</p>"
