  content: "<p>A simple procedure is presented to evaluate the standard uncertainty
    of a quantity about which discretized measurement data are available. The procedure
    is based on Bayesian statistics and depends on the value of the experimental variance.
    If the variance is less than a certain limit, the standard uncertainty can be
    obtained by the numerical approximations and plots provided in the paper. Otherwise,
    the data can be treated as if it were not resolution-limited.</p>"
