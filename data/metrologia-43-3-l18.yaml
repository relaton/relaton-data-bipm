abstract:
- content: "<p>In response to the comment by Jefferts and Levi on page L11 of this
    issue, we review the uncertainty budget quoted in our earlier paper on the evaluation
    of the caesium primary frequency standard NPL-CsF1. As a result of this re-evaluation,
    performed in the light of new analyses and experimental data on the microwave
    leakage shift, we expand the fractional frequency uncertainty for this standard
    to 2.0 × 10<sup>−15</sup> (1σ).</p>"
