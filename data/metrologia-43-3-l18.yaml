    of this issue, we review the uncertainty budget quoted in our earlier paper on
    the evaluation of the caesium primary frequency standard NPL-CsF1. As a result
    of this re-evaluation, performed in the light of new analyses and experimental
    data on the microwave leakage shift, we expand the fractional frequency uncertainty
    for this standard to 2.0 × 10<sup>−15</sup> (1σ).</p>
