  content: "<p>The uncertainty of primary standard gas mixtures is limited by the
    uncertainty of their gravimetric preparation. Although this fact is widely accepted,
    it has never been demonstrated directly because the uncertainty involved in the
    analysis of gas mixtures is much larger than that from the gravimetric preparation
    alone. We report the first-ever analysis by a single comparison process of a set
    of independently prepared gravimetric gas mixtures. The analysis of the data has
    used a method that calculates the parameters of a regression relationship that
    minimizes the random contributions from both the model and the gravimetric component.
    The standards studied here are comparable with a standard deviation of the residuals
    of seven measurements (after the exclusion of two outliers) of 0.002% (relative
    to value), or an expanded uncertainty of 0.004% relative. This is a factor of
    between 2 and 30 less than the estimated uncertainties for the gravimetric preparation
    of each individual standard and serves to confirm the state of the art in this
    field.</p>"
