- content: "<p>A number of Joint Committees of the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures and other international organizations carry out particular tasks of
    common interest. The Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM) has amongst
    its tasks the promotion of the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’
    (GUM), the preparation of further documents for its broad application, and revision
    and promotion of the use of the ‘International Vocabulary of Basic and General
    Terms in Metrology’. This paper summarizes the documents relating to the GUM planned
    by JCGM.</p>"
