abstract:
- content: "<p>For metrology to be recognized as a measurement science, it must be
    seen to be using the scientific method. This requires metrologists to make predictions
    that can be tested and validated by experiment. The fundamental testable prediction
    is usually a variant of ‘agreement within the claimed uncertainty’, and the experiment
    is usually a comparison of two or more nominally identical measurements. The normalized
    error, E<sub>n</sub>, can be generalized as the ratio of {a difference of the
    two values} to {the standard uncertainty in the difference of the two values}.
    This definition can apply equally to the difference between a particular measurement
    and a reference value with an uncertainty or to an unmediated bilateral difference
    between two measurements considered as peers. This latter interpretation leads
    to the creation of a family of bilateral E<sub>n</sub> values in a comparison,
    which can be aggregated by taking the root-mean-square (RMS) average. This RMS
    E<sub>n</sub> is a norm that can support intuitive ideas of ordering performance
    in the comparison. The mean-square E<sub>n</sub> is a chi-squared-like statistic
    and can be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation to perform quantitative tests of
    the ideal agreement hypothesis for a comparison. The use of these statistics in
    broader aggregates is discussed: averaging across similar unlinked key/regional
    comparisons, across a range of artefact values, across different principal measurement
    techniques in a given metrology area or even across all major metrology areas
    spanning the entire International System of Units. Each of these ‘averages’ can
    be done as an overall aggregate of all participants or can focus on one particular
    participant's RMS E<sub>n</sub> aggregated with respect to all its peers' results.</p>"
