abstract:
- content: "<p>We compare three approaches for quantifying uncertainty through a measurement
    equation: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), draft GUM Supplement 1 and Bayesian
    statistics. For illustration, we use a measurement equation for simple linear
    calibration that includes both Type A and Type B input variables. We consider
    three scenarios: (i) the measurement equation is linear with one Type B input
    variable having a normal distribution, (ii) the measurement equation is non-linear
    with two Type B input variables each having a normal distribution and (iii) the
    measurement equation is non-linear with two Type B input variables each having
    a rectangular distribution. We consider both small and large uncertainties for
    the Type B input variables. We use each of the three approaches to quantify the
    uncertainty in measurement for each of the three scenarios. Then we discuss the
    merits and limitations of each approach.</p>"
