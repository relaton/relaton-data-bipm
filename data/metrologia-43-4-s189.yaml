  content: "<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (GUM) describes a generic
    procedure for determining an estimate for the value of the measurand and its associated
    combined standard uncertainty from the estimates and their associated standard
    uncertainties for various input quantities. A user of the ISO-GUM who is interested
    in understanding, managing or improving the measurement procedure needs the details,
    usually expressed as an uncertainty budget, on how the estimate for the value
    of the measurand and its associated combined standard uncertainty were calculated.
    In particular, a user may be interested in quantifying the degrees of contribution
    to the combined standard uncertainty from its components. When the measurement
    equation is a linear function of uncorrelated input variables, the contribution
    from a component is usually quantified by the product of the component of uncertainty
    and its sensitivity coefficient. This paper introduces a coefficient of contribution
    that is suitable for both uncorrelated and correlated input variables. The proposed
    coefficient of contribution is useful for a variety of measurement equations.
    Correlations between input variables can significantly alter the relative importance
    of the contributions to the combined standard uncertainty from its components.</p>"
