abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) describes a generic procedure for
    determining an estimate for the value of the measurand and its associated combined
    standard uncertainty from the estimates and their associated standard uncertainties
    for various input quantities. A user of the ISO-GUM who is interested in understanding,
    managing or improving the measurement procedure needs the details, usually expressed
    as an uncertainty budget, on how the estimate for the value of the measurand and
    its associated combined standard uncertainty were calculated. In particular, a
    user may be interested in quantifying the degrees of contribution to the combined
    standard uncertainty from its components. When the measurement equation is a linear
    function of uncorrelated input variables, the contribution from a component is
    usually quantified by the product of the component of uncertainty and its sensitivity
    coefficient. This paper introduces a coefficient of contribution that is suitable
    for both uncorrelated and correlated input variables. The proposed coefficient
    of contribution is useful for a variety of measurement equations. Correlations
    between input variables can significantly alter the relative importance of the
    contributions to the combined standard uncertainty from its components.</p>"
