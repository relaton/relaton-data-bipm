- language: en

  content: "<p>A non-linear function of a sample average is different from the average
    of that function evaluated for each element of the sample. However, in the <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (GUM) the second approach
    to calculating an average is considered potentially preferable to the first in
    order to obtain a measurand estimate. In this paper the issue is discussed, and
    it is shown that the second approach is inconsistent with the GUM framework. However,
    it is indeed preferable for input quantities having an intrinsically random behaviour.
    We comment on the approach adopted in this respect in Supplement 1 of the GUM
    and show that it is consistent with the first method.</p>"
