abstract:
- content: "<p>A non-linear function of a sample average is different from the average
    of that function evaluated for each element of the sample. However, in the Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) the second approach to calculating
    an average is considered potentially preferable to the first in order to obtain
    a measurand estimate. In this paper the issue is discussed, and it is shown that
    the second approach is inconsistent with the GUM framework. However, it is indeed
    preferable for input quantities having an intrinsically random behaviour. We comment
    on the approach adopted in this respect in Supplement 1 of the GUM and show that
    it is consistent with the first method.</p>"
