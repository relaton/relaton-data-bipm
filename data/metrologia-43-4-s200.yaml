abstract:
- content: "<p>Modern evaluation of measurement uncertainty is based on both the knowledge
    about the measurement process and the (input) quantities which influence the result
    of measurement. The knowledge about the input quantities is represented by means
    of appropriate probability density functions (pdfs), whereas the knowledge about
    the measurement process is expressed by a so-called model equation which reflects
    the interrelation between the measurand and the input quantities. The assignment
    of a pdf for a quantity is based on sound theory but there is no theory on modelling.
    Neither the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement nor other relevant
    uncertainty documents provide any guidance on systematic modelling. This paper
    proposes a systematic and versatile modelling concept that has evolved from the
    idea of the classical measuring chain. From this concept, a systematic procedure
    for modelling of measurements has been derived which is structured into five fundamental
    work steps and requires three types of standard modelling components. The concept
    utilizes only a few generic model structures which are strongly related to the
    method of measurement employed. These generic model structures can easily be tailored
    to any particular measurement task. The paper provides the theoretical reasoning
    for this concept and derives practical procedures for its application.</p>"
