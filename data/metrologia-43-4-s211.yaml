  content: "<p>The sciences of probability and statistics involve the practitioner
    in a kind of thinking that promotes good decision-making. This article describes
    principles of probability and statistics that underlie such thinking in metrology,
    particularly in the analysis of uncertainties and interlaboratory comparisons.
    These principles are applicable whatever reasonable understanding of probability
    is held.</p>"
