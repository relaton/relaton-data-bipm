abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reviews the purposes of CIPM key comparisons and presents
    a model-based analysis that is in keeping with these purposes. Measures of ‘operability’
    and ‘interoperability’ are derived to answer the reasonable questions ‘how accurate
    will the result be when the laboratory in question makes some measurement in the
    future?’ and ‘how similar would the results be if two laboratories were to make
    a common measurement in the future?’ These are explicit questions that relate
    to the concepts of measurement ability and the equivalence of standards. The basic
    concepts emphasized are that (i) a measurement result cannot legitimately contribute
    to its own point of reference and that (ii) the effects causing error, or uncertainty,
    that are relevant in forming the measures of operability and interoperability
    are those that vary after the key comparison. Therefore, points of references
    for each measurement result are formed by excluding the result in question, and
    the measures of operability and interoperability are defined using the uncertainty
    components with effects varying on the short time-scale. These measures have clear
    and communicable meanings.</p>"
