  content: "<p>This paper develops a Bayesian procedure to evaluate comparison data
    when more than two participants measure independently a stable travelling standard.
    The procedure yields the analytic probability density function (pdf) that encodes
    the collective state of knowledge. From this pdf, the estimated value of the measurand
    may be derived numerically, together with its associated standard uncertainty
    and coverage interval. The pdfs for the degrees of equivalence of the participating
    laboratories can also be calculated.</p>"
