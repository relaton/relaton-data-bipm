  content: "<p>For metrology to be recognized as a measurement science, it must be
    seen to be using the scientific method. This requires metrologists to make predictions
    that can be tested and validated by experiment. The fundamental testable prediction
    is usually a variant of ‘agreement within the claimed uncertainty’, and the experiment
    is usually a comparison of two or more nominally identical measurements. The normalized
    error, <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub>, can be generalized as the ratio of {a difference
    of the two values} to {the standard uncertainty in the difference of the two values}.
    This definition can apply equally to the difference between a particular measurement
    and a reference value with an uncertainty or to an unmediated bilateral difference
    between two measurements considered as peers. This latter interpretation leads
    to the creation of a family of bilateral <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub> values
    in a comparison, which can be aggregated by taking the root-mean-square (RMS)
    average. This RMS <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub> is a norm that can support intuitive
    ideas of ordering performance in the comparison. The mean-square <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub>
    is a chi-squared-like statistic and can be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation
    to perform quantitative tests of the ideal agreement hypothesis for a comparison.
    The use of these statistics in broader aggregates is discussed: averaging across
    similar unlinked key/regional comparisons, across a range of artefact values,
    across different principal measurement techniques in a given metrology area or
    even across all major metrology areas spanning the entire International System
    of Units. Each of these ‘averages’ can be done as an overall aggregate of all
    participants or can focus on one particular participant's RMS <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub>
    aggregated with respect to all its peers' results.</p>"
