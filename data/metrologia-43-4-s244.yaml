  content: "<p>In the analysis of the results of an international comparison it is
    not exceptional that one or even several values are not in line with the others.
    It is often difficult to find good reasons—empirical or even statistical—for rejecting
    these data that may strongly influence the reference value. The median has been
    recognized as useful for the analysis of comparisons in the field of radioactivity
    as it avoids the need to cope with outliers. In this paper, the median is used
    as the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and the formulae necessary to evaluate
    its uncertainty and that of the degree of equivalence are given. In addition,
    the weighted median is also defined for use as the KCRV. Equivalent formulae are
    deduced for this estimator. This paper thus enlarges the range of concepts published
    previously for KCRV estimators.</p>"
