abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurement data subject only to random effects can be evaluated within
    the frameworks of conventional as well as Bayesian statistical theory. In this
    paper, both viewpoints are presented and examples including Gaussian, uniform
    and Poisson statistics are discussed. The cases of data produced by different
    observers, and of quantities expressed by measurement models involving systematic
    effects, are also briefly touched upon. It is shown that, although in most practical
    cases the uncertainty intervals obtained from repeated measurements using either
    theory may be similar, their interpretation is completely different. Since the
    Bayesian approach treats random and systematic effects in the same way, the authors
    claim that it is more flexible and better adapted to practice than conventional
    theory.</p>"
