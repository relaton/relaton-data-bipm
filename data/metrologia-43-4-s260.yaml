abstract:
- content: "<p>In the conventional least squares solution of an overdetermined system
    of linear equations, independently distributed (i.d.) errors are assumed to affect
    the known terms. However, in most metrological applications, both matrix elements
    and known terms can be affected by errors with zero averages and different variances
    because they represent, in general, various physical quantities and therefore
    they can be measured with different accuracy. This paper reviews the least squares
    formulation with element-wise weighting, hereafter called element-wise weighted
    least squares (EWLS), applied to metrology. Formulations take into account i.d.
    errors in both matrix elements and known terms but relax the assumption of identical
    variances of element errors peculiar to the total least squares approach, while
    preserving their statistical independence. The variances of matrix elements and
    known terms are statistically independent or linked, for elements of single rows,
    by a generic covariance matrix. The latter statistical dependence can be accounted
    for successfully. Some examples compare the performances of the EWLS formulation
    with the more popular weighted least squares and total least squares approaches.
    Then, EWLS is applied for calibrating colorimeters as the devoted least-squares
    approach allows the uncertainties to be taken into proper account. Experimental
    results show the capabilities of the proposed method for accurate calibrations.</p>"
