abstract:
- content: "<p>An analysis is presented of the generalized weighted mean of a set
    of quantities, some or all of which may be correlated, and the variance associated
    with that mean. The cases covered specifically are (a) two correlated quantities,
    (b) a general number of quantities, two of which are correlated and (c) a general
    number of quantities, all of which are correlated. For (c), two instances are
    treated, namely where the quantity variances are equal and unequal. Consistency
    of the data representing realizations of the quantities concerned is shown to
    be important in terms of appreciating the results obtained.</p>"
