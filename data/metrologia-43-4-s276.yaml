  content: "<p>When repeated measurements are autocorrelated, it is not appropriate
    to use the traditional approach to calculate the uncertainty of the average of
    the measurements, which assumes that the measurements are statistically independent.
    In this paper, we propose a practical approach to calculate the corresponding
    uncertainty and the confidence interval when the data are from a stationary process.
    For illustration, the approach is applied to two examples: linewidth measurements
    made by a scanning electron microscope and weight measurements. The results are
    also extended to the general case in which both Type A and Type B uncertainty
    components are presented and to the case of weighted means.</p>"
