abstract:
- content: "<p>Coordinate metrology often involves fitting a geometric surface to
    coordinate data. The increasingly rigorous approaches to uncertainty evaluation
    being developed across metrology have been reflected in the need to evaluate the
    uncertainties associated with coordinate data and calculate how these uncertainties
    are propagated through to uncertainties associated with the parameters describing
    the fitted surface. Standard least squares algorithms such as orthogonal distance
    regression (ODR) for finding the best-fit surface implicitly assume that the uncertainties
    associated with the coordinates are uncorrelated and axis-isotropic, i.e. the
    uncertainties associated with the x-, y- and z-coordinates are equal, but very
    few coordinate measuring systems have such uncertainty characteristics. Given
    a model of the measurement system, it is possible to propagate uncertainties associated
    with systematic and random effects influencing the measurements to determine an
    uncertainty matrix associated with the measured coordinates. This uncertainty
    matrix will generally be full, reflecting correlation amongst all the measured
    coordinates, but will have a factorization structure that gives a compact representation
    of the sources of uncertainty. In this paper, we derive surface fitting algorithms
    that take account of the coordinate uncertainties in order to provide maximum
    likelihood estimates of the surface parameters. We show that ODR algorithms can
    be adapted to take into account the type of uncertainty matrices that arise in
    practice, exploiting the factorization structure to enable very efficient implementations
    of these algorithms. As a result, a significant class of surface fitting problems
    can be solved efficiently using standard nonlinear least squares algorithms. We
    also discuss how the algorithms can be modified to account for probe radius effects.
    The calculation of the uncertainties associated with the fitted surface parameters
    is also derived in such a way that systematic effects associated with the measuring
    system, such as scale errors, are automatically accounted for.</p>"
