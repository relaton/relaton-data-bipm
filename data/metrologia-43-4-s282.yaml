  content: "<p>Coordinate metrology often involves fitting a geometric surface to
    coordinate data. The increasingly rigorous approaches to uncertainty evaluation
    being developed across metrology have been reflected in the need to evaluate the
    uncertainties associated with coordinate data and calculate how these uncertainties
    are propagated through to uncertainties associated with the parameters describing
    the fitted surface. Standard least squares algorithms such as orthogonal distance
    regression (ODR) for finding the best-fit surface implicitly assume that the uncertainties
    associated with the coordinates are uncorrelated and axis-isotropic, i.e. the
    uncertainties associated with the <italic>x</italic>-, <italic>y</italic>- and
    <italic>z</italic>-coordinates are equal, but very few coordinate measuring systems
    have such uncertainty characteristics. Given a model of the measurement system,
    it is possible to propagate uncertainties associated with systematic and random
    effects influencing the measurements to determine an uncertainty matrix associated
    with the measured coordinates. This uncertainty matrix will generally be full,
    reflecting correlation amongst all the measured coordinates, but will have a factorization
    structure that gives a compact representation of the sources of uncertainty. In
    this paper, we derive surface fitting algorithms that take account of the coordinate
    uncertainties in order to provide maximum likelihood estimates of the surface
    parameters. We show that ODR algorithms can be adapted to take into account the
    type of uncertainty matrices that arise in practice, exploiting the factorization
    structure to enable very efficient implementations of these algorithms. As a result,
    a significant class of surface fitting problems can be solved efficiently using
    standard nonlinear least squares algorithms. We also discuss how the algorithms
    can be modified to account for probe radius effects. The calculation of the uncertainties
    associated with the fitted surface parameters is also derived in such a way that
    systematic effects associated with the measuring system, such as scale errors,
    are automatically accounted for.</p>"
