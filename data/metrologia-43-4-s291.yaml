abstract:
- content: "<p>The determination of a best-fit calibration curve that describes the
    response of a measuring system to the value of a standard is one of the most widely
    used procedures in metrology. The mathematical basis for a generalized least-squares
    solution to this problem is reviewed. Examples of the application of a software
    implementation of the method are presented to illustrate the treatment of calibration
    problems with different uncertainty structures for the calibration data, including
    correlated data. The examples concern the calibration of analysers to measure
    the composition of natural gas and the calibration of a gas flow dilutor.</p>"
