abstract:
- content: "<p>This work gives an algorithm for combining the readings of an ensemble
    of clocks in which noisy pairwise comparisons are admitted. It extends and generalizes
    a previously published Kalman filter algorithm that is useful only for an ensemble
    of clocks within the same laboratory. The present algorithm may be useful for
    an ensemble of clocks distributed among several remote laboratories.</p>"
