abstract:
- content: "<p>‘Theo1’ (short terminology for ‘theoretical variance #1’) is derived
    based on, a variance that separates the Allan variance's averaging time (τ) from
    its sampling interval (τ<sub>\n s</sub>), also called ‘stride’, as applied to
    normalized fractional-frequency y(t). The τ-length average of y(t) is denoted,
    and every permissible squared difference of \n-values in \n is averaged in mτ<sub>0</sub>
    segments of y(t) to compute Theo1(m, τ<sub>0</sub>). Although biased relative
    to the Allan variance, Theo1(m, τ<sub>0</sub>) mimics all statistical properties
    of the Allan variance and works to very long stride. Its estimator\n has substantially
    better confidence compared with the best Allan estimator, called ‘Avar’. To make
    an Allan-compatible statistic, a novel ‘bias-removed’ version of \n variance,
    called ‘\n’ variance, yields ThêoH variance (‘H’ to indicate high confidence and/or
    hybrid Allan and \n functions). ThêoH deviation combines the Allan deviation in
    short term and \n deviation in long term, reporting very long-term frequency stability
    50% beyond that possible using the Allan deviation alone and with excellent confidence.</p>"
