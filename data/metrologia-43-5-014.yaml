abstract:
- content: "<p>The ubiquitous technology of magnetic force compensation of gravitational
    forces acting on artifacts on the pans of modern balances and comparators has
    brought with it the problem of magnetic leakage from the compensation coils. Leaking
    magnetic fields, as well as those due to the surroundings of the balance, can
    interact with the artifact whose mass is to be determined, causing erroneous values
    to be observed. For this reason, and to comply with normative standards, it has
    become important for mass metrologists to evaluate the magnetic susceptibility
    and any remanent magnetization that mass standards may possess. This paper describes
    a comparison of measurements of these parameters among seventeen national metrology
    institutes. The measurements are made on three transfer standards whose magnetic
    parameters span the range that might be encountered in stainless steel mass standards.</p>"
