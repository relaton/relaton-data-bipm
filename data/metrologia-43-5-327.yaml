  content: "<p>Calibrated standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) are used
    to realize the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) from 13.8033 K
    to 1234.93 K. The SPRTs are calibrated at a series of fixed points, each assigned
    a temperature on the ITS90, by measuring the ratios of the SPRT resistances at
    those temperatures to that at the triple point of water (TPW). For realizing the
    scale with a calibrated SPRT, a user measures the resistance ratio at the unknown
    temperature and uses ITS-90-defined equations to interpolate between fixed points.
    The uncertainty of the SPRT temperature is therefore largely influenced by the
    propagation of fixed-point resistance-ratio uncertainties. In this paper, we rigorously
    derive the equations for calculating these uncertainties for a variety of circumstances
    and we use software tools written by us to perform these calculations using realistic
    uncertainties for fixed points and other input parameters. For properly calculating
    the standard uncertainty for SPRT realization of the ITS-90, correlations between
    the input quantities must be considered, in particular those involving measurement
    of the TPW resistance. The proper calculation depends on three factors involving
    SPRT use and calibration. The different combinations of these factors result in
    six different equations for calculating the realization uncertainty. We derive
    these six equations, specify the conditions of their use and discuss the relevant
    uncertainty components for each of them. We also compare the results of these
    equations with those of two approximations that may be used for calculating the
    standard uncertainty and explain the conditions under which the simpler approximations
    agree with the more detailed calculations. Because these calculations are complicated,
    we are making our software tools available upon request to the user community.</p>"
