  content: "<p>We have performed calculations to study ITS-90 non-uniqueness from
    subrange inconsistencies over the range 24.5561 K to 273.16 K, where the scale
    is defined by an interpolating platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) that is calibrated
    via sets of defined fixed points. For this work, subrange inconsistency calculations
    have been performed on eighteen PRTs; fourteen are standard PRTs and four are
    miniature PRTs. The inconsistency uncertainties, which result from propagation
    of fixed-point uncertainties, have also been calculated. The calculations show
    that PRT subrange inconsistencies in the temperature region studied can be as
    large as 1 mK. We have also studied possible correlations between PRT subrange
    inconsistencies and other PRT properties/parameters that are simpler to determine;
    these studies show that there is a correlation between the average magnitude of
    the inconsistencies and the value of a certain calibration coefficient. Finally,
    for the range studied we have used a statistical analysis on the inconsistencies
    of the PRT ensemble to calculate a standard uncertainty to the ITS-90 temperature
    <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> due to the inconsistencies. Over the temperature
    intervals 25 K ⩽ <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> ⩽ 50 K and 100 K ⩽ <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>
    ⩽ 200 K, this uncertainty dominates those propagated from fixed-point uncertainties.</p>"
