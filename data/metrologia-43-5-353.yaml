abstract:
- content: "<p>‘The present system design’ summarizes the theoretical model, the physical
    realization and the operational analysis of the automatic cavity frequency stabilization
    system based upon square wave modulation of the resonance frequency of the cavity
    in the atomic hydrogen maser. The effect produced on the maser output frequency
    by various perturbations of the cavity frequency is calculated and the theoretical
    results are compared with the experimental measurements. ‘Possible improvements’
    describes an improved design of the cavity frequency control system. An analysis
    of the new servo response to cavity frequency perturbations is given and the improvement
    expected in hydrogen maser frequency stability compared with previous maser performance
    is discussed.</p>"
