  content: "<p>For high-purity metal fixed points the sum of individual estimates
    (SIE) and the overall maximum estimate (OME) have been introduced as tools to
    estimate the uncertainty in the correction for the effect of impurities. In this
    paper we investigate the feasibility of applying these tools to metal–carbon (M–C)
    eutectics as well on the basis of material collected for the eutectics Fe–C and
    Co–C. This would be of interest since it would obviate the need for modelling
    the full freezing or melting curve, which requires detailed knowledge of the material
    properties involved. For SIE we need only the liquidus slopes pertinent to the
    detected impurities, whereas for OME under certain conditions detailed knowledge
    of the impurity parameters would not be needed at all.</p>"
