abstract:
- content: "<p>In attempting to develop a capacitance standard based on the charge
    of the electron, one question which has been open for many years is the frequency
    dependence of the vacuum-gap cryogenic capacitor; the crucial difficulty has been:
    How do we measure frequency dependence down to 0.01 Hz? In this paper, we succeed
    in putting an upper bound on the frequency dependence, from 0.01 Hz to 1 kHz,
    of about 2 × 10<sup>−7</sup>. We do this by considering a model for the dispersion
    in the surface insulating films on the surface of the Cu electrodes; the crucial
    prediction of this model is that the dispersion falls to very low values at low
    temperatures. By measuring the frequency dependence over a restricted range of
    frequencies, we have verified this prediction, and thus provide adequate support
    to conclude that the model is correct. We also point out that, independent of
    the capacitance standard, this cryogenic capacitor provides a frequency-independent
    standard for measurements in fields such as the low-temperature dynamics of amorphous
    materials.</p>"
