abstract:
- content: "<p>Motivated by emerging needs for accurate force measurements in the
    nanotechnology and biophysics areas, we present an atomic force microscope (AFM)
    cantilever calibration system, the ‘nano force calibrator’ (NFC), consisting of
    a microbalance and a precision translation stage. Calibration using the NFC has
    proved to be a reliable and accurate method through a series of experiments with
    a commercial piezoresistive AFM cantilever. In these experiments, linearity, repeatability
    and reproducibility of measurements were investigated along with the effects of
    calibration conditions, such as orientation of the cantilever and temperature.
    Uncertainty analysis shows that the stiffness and force sensitivity are determined
    to be 3.385 N m<sup>−1</sup> and 0.6490 µN Ω<sup>−1</sup>, which are traceable
    to the Système International d'Unités (SI units). The relative standard uncertainties
    of both the stiffness and sensitivity are approximately 0.4% or conservatively
    0.5%.</p>"
