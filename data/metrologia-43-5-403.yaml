  content: "<p>Uncertainties in the distribution temperature (DT) and correlated colour
    temperature are estimated for common sources and typical measurement uncertainties
    of a spectral transfer from a reference lamp. Uncertainty sensitivity coefficients
    for both parameters in terms of measured values of spectral irradiance are derived
    using a generalized matrix inverse. The uncertainty values are compared with differences
    in the source temperature parameters. DT is calculated using the CIE definition;
    shifts in DT due to the alternative of a direct fit of Planck's distribution,
    and to including weights in the process, are compared with the estimated uncertainties.</p>"
