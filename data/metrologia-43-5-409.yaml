abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, it is shown that a quantum Hall resistor (QHR) which
    exhibits a proportionality relationship between the deviation of the Hall resistance
    from R<sub>K</sub>/i and the ac dissipation in the system, represented by ρ<sub>xx</sub>,
    can be used as a primary standard of ac resistance. As an example, a calculable
    quadrifilar resistor was calibrated against the QHR at kilohertz frequencies.
    The agreement between the calibration using the QHR and the calculated frequency
    dependence of the quadrifilar resistor is better than 4 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>
    at 1 kHz. This result is achieved despite the frequency and current dependence
    of the ac-QHR. The most important criterion to achieve accurate measurements using
    an ac-QHR standard is to extrapolate the value of the Hall resistance to zero
    dissipation.</p>"
