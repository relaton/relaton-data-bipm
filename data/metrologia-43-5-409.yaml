  content: "<p>In this paper, it is shown that a quantum Hall resistor (QHR) which
    exhibits a proportionality relationship between the deviation of the Hall resistance
    from <italic>R</italic><sub>K</sub>/<italic>i</italic> and the ac dissipation
    in the system, represented by ρ<sub><italic>xx</italic></sub>, can be used as
    a primary standard of ac resistance. As an example, a calculable quadrifilar resistor
    was calibrated against the QHR at kilohertz frequencies. The agreement between
    the calibration using the QHR and the calculated frequency dependence of the quadrifilar
    resistor is better than 4 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> at 1 kHz. This result is achieved
    despite the frequency and current dependence of the ac-QHR. The most important
    criterion to achieve accurate measurements using an ac-QHR standard is to extrapolate
    the value of the Hall resistance to zero dissipation.</p>"
