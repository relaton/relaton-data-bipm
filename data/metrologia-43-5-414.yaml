abstract:
- content: "<p>The set standard deviation, repeatability and offset of absolute gravimeter
    A10-008 were assessed at the Walferdange Underground Laboratory for Geodynamics
    (WULG) in Luxembourg. Analysis of the data indicates that the instrument performed
    within the specifications of the manufacturer. For A10-008, the average set standard
    deviation was (1.6 ± 0.6) µGal (1Gal ≡ 1 cm s<sup>−2</sup>), the average repeatability
    was (2.9 ± 1.5) µGal, and the average offset compared to absolute gravimeter FG5-216
    was (3.2 ± 3.5) µGal.</p>"
