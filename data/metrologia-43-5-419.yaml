abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses the issue of repeated versus non-repeated measurements
    on standards. Starting from the general issue of replication of measurement operations,
    we consider the consequences of the differences that these two types of measurements
    entail in the comparison of standards. We look at MRA key comparisons (KCs) as
    a specific case. Recent developments seem to have somewhat obscured the fact that
    the replication and combination of observations is the everyday task of NMIs.
    Therefore, this paper first recalls the many facets of intra-laboratory measurements
    on standards, some not very different from the inter-laboratory exercises. The
    meaning of the replicated observations is analysed starting from this context.
    Then the issue is examined in the context of inter-laboratory comparisons, namely,
    in the case of KCs. Some of the consequences for the statistical treatment of
    repeated and non-repeated measurement data are illustrated and solutions proposed.</p>"
