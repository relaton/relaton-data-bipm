  content: "<p>This paper discusses the issue of repeated versus non-repeated measurements
    on standards. Starting from the general issue of replication of measurement operations,
    we consider the consequences of the differences that these two types of measurements
    entail in the comparison of standards. We look at MRA key comparisons (KCs) as
    a specific case. Recent developments seem to have somewhat obscured the fact that
    the replication and combination of observations is the everyday task of NMIs.
    Therefore, this paper first recalls the many facets of <italic>intra</italic>-laboratory
    measurements on standards, some not very different from the <italic>inter</italic>-laboratory
    exercises. The meaning of the replicated observations is analysed starting from
    this context. Then the issue is examined in the context of <italic>inter</italic>-laboratory
    comparisons, namely, in the case of KCs. Some of the consequences for the statistical
    treatment of repeated and non-repeated measurement data are illustrated and solutions
    proposed.</p>"
