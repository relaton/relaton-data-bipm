abstract:
- content: "<p>Sources of bias in the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    ozone Standard Reference Photometer (SRP) maintained by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures have been investigated. A relative bias of −0.4% in the ozone
    mole fraction measurement caused by a temperature gradient in the gas cells of
    the instrument was characterized and corrected for in a modified version of the
    instrument. A second relative bias of +0.5% due to the multiple reflections of
    light within the gas cells was also corrected. The Guide to the Expression of
    Uncertainty in Measurement approach was used to develop an uncertainty budget
    for the modified SRP, including a relative value for the ozone absorption cross-section
    uncertainty of 2.1% (k = 2). The measurement uncertainty for the bias-corrected
    SRPs is enlarged compared with earlier studies, but their comparability improved.</p>"
