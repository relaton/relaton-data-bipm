  content: "<p>Sources of bias in the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    ozone Standard Reference Photometer (SRP) maintained by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures have been investigated. A relative bias of −0.4% in the ozone
    mole fraction measurement caused by a temperature gradient in the gas cells of
    the instrument was characterized and corrected for in a modified version of the
    instrument. A second relative bias of +0.5% due to the multiple reflections of
    light within the gas cells was also corrected. The <italic>Guide to the Expression
    of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> approach was used to develop an uncertainty
    budget for the modified SRP, including a relative value for the ozone absorption
    cross-section uncertainty of 2.1% (<italic>k</italic> = 2). The measurement uncertainty
    for the bias-corrected SRPs is enlarged compared with earlier studies, but their
    comparability improved.</p>"
