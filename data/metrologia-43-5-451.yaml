abstract:
- content: "<p>GPS is already a main method of positioning measurement in geodesy
    and is applied widely in many fields. In order to maintain and ensure the accuracy
    of positioning, an accurate and efficient system for calibrating the GPS receivers
    must be established. A highly accurate GPS calibration network, tied to the ITRF
    coordinates of IGS stations, can be effectively used to evaluate the performance
    of GPS receivers. This study addresses the feasibility of establishing a system
    for calibrating GPS receivers and the system's traceability in metrology. Uncertainties
    of the GPS calibration networks were established and maintained by NML (National
    Measurement Laboratory, Taiwan). Furthermore, the networks are evaluated based
    on the method suggested by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization).
    The uncertainties of NML network coordinates are obtained and used as a basis
    for calibration. The results of the slope distances between pillars measured by
    the GPS processing units and the precise EDM units are discussed. Analytical results
    indicate that the 3D expanded uncertainty of the main station TNML of the network
    in the ITRF system is around 33.2 mm at the 95% confidence level. The 3D expanded
    uncertainties of the calibration points of the ultra-short distance network and
    the short distance network are evaluated to be about 2.2 mm and 3.4 mm, respectively
    in relation to the main station TNML at the 95% confidence level. The precision
    of the NML network coordinates suffices to calibrate the geodetic and navigational
    GPS receivers of regional users and is available through the Internet.</p>"
