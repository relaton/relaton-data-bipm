abstract:
- content: "<p>Eleven platinum resistance thermometers (PRT) were compared at the
    Al–Cu eutectic point (548.2 °C) in order to measure the non-uniqueness of ITS-90
    roughly half-way between the Zn and the Al points. It turned out that the cubic
    deviation function describes this set of PRTs within ±0.6 mK in this temperature
    interval.</p><p>In addition, the measured data were used to determine the non-uniqueness
    and the sub-range inconsistency, using cubic and quadratic deviation functions,
    at the In point (156.6 °C). The non-uniqueness was found to be ± 0.26 mK, and
    the sub-range inconsistency ± 0.12 mK.</p>"
