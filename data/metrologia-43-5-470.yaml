abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper deals with the problem of establishing degrees of equivalence
    for national measurement standards participating in regional key comparisons (RMO
    KC), with respect to a key comparison reference value (KCRV), using measurement
    results obtained by linking national metrology institutes (NMIs). Two types of
    key comparisons are considered, which differ in applying either a material measure
    or a measuring instrument as a travelling measurement standard.</p><p>The results
    obtained by linking NMIs are used to determine transformation procedures for measurement
    results of the RMO KC so that the transformed results can be compared directly
    with CIPM KC results.</p><p>Formulae are given for evaluating the degrees of equivalence
    of the national measurement standards of laboratories participating in the RMO
    KC, with respect to the KCRV, taking into account possible correlations between
    measurement results.</p>"
