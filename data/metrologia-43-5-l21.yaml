    for computing the coverage interval of the convolution of two Student's <italic>t</italic>
    distributions. This approximation appeared to perform well for a limited range
    of values of the degrees of freedom. In this letter, we provide an eight-line
    program for <italic>exact</italic> computation of the coverage interval with no
    limitations. Several advantages of our approach are noted.</p>
