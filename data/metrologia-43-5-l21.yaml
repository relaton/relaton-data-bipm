abstract:
- content: "<p>Fotowicz (2006 Metrologia 43 42â€“5) presented an approximation for computing
    the coverage interval of the convolution of two Student's t distributions. This
    approximation appeared to perform well for a limited range of values of the degrees
    of freedom. In this letter, we provide an eight-line program for exact computation
    of the coverage interval with no limitations. Several advantages of our approach
    are noted.</p>"
