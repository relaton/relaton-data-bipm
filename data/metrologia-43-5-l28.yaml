  content: "<p>Measurement of the thickness of SiO<sub>2</sub> films on crystalline
    Si substrates was the subject of the key comparison (K-32) of the Surface Analysis
    Working Group of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance. X-ray photoelectron
    spectroscopy (XPS) gave the most reproducible results that are consistent with
    other reflectivity based methods. In addition, XPS is free from surface contamination
    effects. However, the emission angle of photoelectrons is one of the main sources
    of the uncertainty in the measured thickness. In this report, we propose a simple
    and reliable procedure to determine the surface normal for accurate control of
    the emission angle using an amorphous SiO<sub>2</sub> overlayer on an amorphous
    Si substrate. The surface normal can be accurately determined from the condition
    that the estimated thickness of a SiO<sub>2</sub> overlayer on an amorphous Si
    substrate measured must be the same for different emission angles. With the proposed
    calibration procedure, the surface normal can be determined precisely and the
    uncertainty of the electron emission angle can be evaluated.</p>"
