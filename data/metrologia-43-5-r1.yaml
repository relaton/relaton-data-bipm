  content: "<p>We briefly review the recent experimental results on possible variations
    of the fine structure constant α on the cosmological time scale and its position
    dependence. We outline the theoretical grounds for the assumption that α might
    be variable, mention some phenomenological models incorporating a variable α into
    the context of modern cosmology and discuss the significance of possible α variations
    for theoretical and practical metrology.</p>"
