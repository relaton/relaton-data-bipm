abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper gives equations that enable a method of uncertainty analysis
    recently described (Willink R 2005 Metrologia 42 329–43) to accommodate influence
    variables with asymmetric probability distributions. The equations permit the
    calculation of 90%, 95%, 98% and 99% coverage intervals [a, b] for the measurand
    Y = F(X<sub>1</sub>,…, X<sub>m</sub>) from the first four moments of an approximating
    distribution. The equations for 90% and 98% are presented so that the one-sided
    probability statements Pr(Y ⩾ a) = P and Pr(Y ⩽ b) = P can be supplied for the
    familiar probability levels of P = 95% and P = 99%. Additional equations are provided
    so that the exact moments can be calculated in certain non-linear problems. An
    improved method is given for dealing with inputs that have shifted and scaled
    t-distributions with 4 or fewer degrees of freedom, for which the first four moments
    do not all exist.</p>"
