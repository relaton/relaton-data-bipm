  content: "<p>This paper presents a method for constructing uncertainty regions for
    a vector measurand in the presence of both type-A and type-B errors. The method
    is based on the principle of fiducial inference and generally requires a Monte
    Carlo approach for computing uncertainty regions. A small simulation study is
    carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Computer programs
    written using public-domain software for computing uncertainty regions are listed.
    An example, involving complex <italic>S</italic>-parameter measurements, is used
    to illustrate the proposed method.</p>"
