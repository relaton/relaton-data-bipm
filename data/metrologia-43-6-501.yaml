  content: "<p>Three nickel–carbon (Ni–C) and three iron–carbon (Fe–C) eutectic fixed
    points cells of a new design, meeting the requirements for reliable applications
    and being suitable for the calibration of thermocouples, were constructed at PTB
    and Inmetro. Their melting temperatures were compared by using the high-temperature
    furnace of PTB (HTF-R) and two platinum/palladium (Pt/Pd) thermocouples. The measured
    emfs of the Ni–C eutectic fixed point cells at the inflection points of the melting
    curves agree within a temperature equivalent of about 0.29 °C, compared with an
    agreement of about 0.09 °C found for the Fe–C cells. Additional comparison measurements
    of two Fe–C eutectic fixed point cells in a second high-temperature furnace (HTF-M,
    Inmetro) demonstrate the applicability of the Fe–C eutectic cells as transfer
    standards for the dissemination of temperatures.</p>"
