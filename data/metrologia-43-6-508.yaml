abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents measurements of the absolute spectral responsivity
    of Ge and InGaAs trap detectors carried out by direct comparison with an electrically
    calibrated cryogenic radiometer (ECCR) in the near-infrared spectral range. Two
    tunable laser diodes were used as radiation sources operating between 1260 nm
    and 1360 nm and between 1460 nm and 1620 nm. The measurements of the cavity absorption
    and the Brewster-angled window transmission of the ECCR in these wavelength ranges
    are presented. A detailed analysis of the total measurement uncertainty is performed.
    The relative standard uncertainty of the responsivity measurement achieved is
    less than 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for all wavelengths investigated. The measurements
    are also discussed in terms of external spectral quantum efficiency, which is
    up to 90% for the Ge trap and up to 93% for the InGaAs trap. The determined spectral
    responsivities are compared with the existing scale for spectral responsivity
    at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (the German National Metrology Institute)
    based on a thermopile detector. The deviation between the scales is at most ±
    0.15% for the InGaAs trap detector and at most ± 0.30% for the Ge trap detector.
    The agreement is therefore within the combined standard uncertainties.</p>"
