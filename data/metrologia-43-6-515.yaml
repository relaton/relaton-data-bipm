  content: "<p>Copper-freezing-point blackbodies used in radiation thermometry should
    preferably provide sufficiently long service. A blackbody of this sort commonly
    comprises a highly pure copper sample surrounding a graphite cavity inside a graphite
    shell closed at both ends by graphite components. We have found that the linear
    expansion of the solid copper sample in heating from room temperature to the melting
    point marginally exceeds the linear contraction of the molten sample in cooling
    to room temperature, presumably due to the gravitational forces that tend to flatten
    the sample during solidification. The excess expansion causes various stresses
    in the graphite components. Some of them will eventually fail structurally after
    a number of cycles of melting and freezing of the sample. This paper presents
    experimental results of the excess expansion, delineates the various stresses
    and suggests design improvements for longer service.</p>"
