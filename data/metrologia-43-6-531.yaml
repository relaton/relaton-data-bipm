abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper analyses two possible estimators for the modulus of a complex-valued
    quantity. The case of uncorrelated and normally distributed real and imaginary
    parts is treated. The expectations of the two estimators are calculated for varying
    parameters of the two normal distributions. They are derived analytically, when
    possible, otherwise numerically by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Studying
    the statistical behaviour of the two estimators, it can be deduced which represents
    the best choice, depending on the specific experimental context. The relationship
    between the second estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator for a Rayleigh
    distribution is also presented. Examples from the metrological and physical fields
    are provided in order to compare the considered estimation methods.</p>"
