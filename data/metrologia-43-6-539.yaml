  content: "<p>A procedure is presented to evaluate the expanded uncertainty of a
    quantity about which discretized measurement data are available. The method is
    based on conventional statistics and depends on the value of the experimental
    variance and the resolution. The suggested procedure is compared with a recently
    suggested procedure based on Bayesian statistics. The ISO <italic>Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainity in Measurement</italic> (GUM) is discussed briefly.
    It is argued that both conventional and Bayesian statistics give a consistent
    interpretation of the GUM procedure, and the two approaches supplement each other:
    conventional statistics estimates the uncertainty of the measurement procedure,
    while Bayesian statistics gives the uncertainty of the measurand.</p>"
