  content: "<p>A wide variety of empirical equations are used in measurement science
    in which the equation parameters are determined through some form of interpolation
    or least squares fit. When the equation is a good model of the system and the
    fitting process is accompanied by a full uncertainty analysis, the equation parameters
    summarize all the input data and associated uncertainty. Often, however, only
    the uncertainty in the equation result is reported and that information may be
    insufficient to carry out a full uncertainty analysis when the equation is used.
    In particular, the lack of information about correlation is an issue for many
    humidity calculations which require the empirical enhancement factor and vapour
    pressure formulations to be evaluated twice, once directly (i.e. in the forward
    direction) and once in the inverse direction. For these calculations it is clear
    that uncertainties in the two evaluations are correlated and that for sufficiently
    close values, error associated with use of the formulations should cancel. However,
    apart from the special case where the evaluations in each direction are at the
    same vapour pressure, the error and hence the autocorrelation is unknown. When
    the full equation parameter covariance is known, the ‘parameter covariance’ method
    (PCM) presented here does give the reduction in uncertainty expected for autocorrelation
    within the formulation.</p>"
