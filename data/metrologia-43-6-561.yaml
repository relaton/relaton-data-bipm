abstract:
- content: "<p>The impurity effect on fixed-point temperature realization by thermal
    analysis has been assessed. For such an assessment, the following actions were
    conducted: (1) the fabrication of aluminium point cells using 6N or higher-grade
    aluminium samples from different sources (manufacturers), (2) temperature measurements
    during solidification and thermal analyses based on freezing curves obtained from
    the measurements, (3) direct cell comparison among cells of different nominal
    purities and (4) calculation of the departure of the freezing point from the ideally
    defined freezing point by applying the sum of individual estimates (SIE). Two
    aluminium point cells were prepared in action (1) using 6N-grade and one cell
    using 6N5-grade aluminium samples. To realize a fixed point using the cells, a
    fixed-point furnace was developed and evaluated. Temperature measurements in action
    (2) were conducted at different rates of solidification and in accordance with
    the one using the liquidâ€“solid interface technique. Gradients of freezing curves
    were derived in the thermal analysis, and from their dependence on the rate of
    solidification, the impurity effect was evaluated. Indirect cell comparison was
    also derived using the difference in the gradients. It was found that the indirect
    cell comparison was in satisfactory agreement with the direct cell comparison,
    which was obtained from action (3). It was also found that the departure of the
    thermal analysis from the SIE obtained from action (4) was within the uncertainty.
    This fact may imply a possible application of thermal analysis for estimating
    the effect of impurities in the realization of the aluminium point, especially
    for 6N-grade aluminium fixed-point cell as used in the present study.</p>"
