abstract:
- content: "<p>Controlled clearance piston gauges are used as primary pressure standards
    at many national metrology institutes. The National Institute of Standards and
    Technology, in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory (India), is
    studying the performance of a new generation of controlled clearance gauges that
    offer the potential for reduced uncertainties. The gauges are also well suited
    to interlaboratory comparisons because of their smaller, integrated design and
    use of existing mass sets. In this paper we present results of the characterization
    of a 200 MPa oil-operated controlled clearance gauge with a 2.5 mm nominal diameter
    piston and cylinder. The gauge is operated with an external cylinder pressure
    of 0 MPa to 80 MPa. We present results of piston fall rate measurements, deformation
    measurements, piston diameter measurements and modelling calculations using the
    Heydemann–Welch (HW) method on two occasions over a two-year time period. The
    relative standard uncertainties in the effective area (A<sub>e</sub>) using the
    HW method range from 24 × 10<sup>−6</sup> at 20 MPa to 37 × 10<sup>−6</sup> at
    200 MPa. We have compared results of the HW method to the present NIST hydraulic
    pressure scale. For the entire pressure range, there is agreement in A<sub>e</sub>
    within the combined standard uncertainty (k = 1).</p>"
