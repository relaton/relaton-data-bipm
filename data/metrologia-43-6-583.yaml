abstract:
- content: "<p>This report summarizes a round table session held last July at the
    CPEM 2006 to discuss recently proposed redefinitions of some base units of the
    International System of Units (SI) based on defined values of some fundamental
    constants. The aim of the session was to inform CPEM delegates of the various
    proposals and to promote a wide discussion of the issues arising from them. An
    interdisciplinary panel of six experts from national metrology institutes, the
    academic community and the industrial metrology community briefly presented their
    views and their concerns. The presentations were followed by a session in which
    the panel answered questions and heard comments from the audience.</p>"
