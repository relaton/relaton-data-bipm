  content: "<p>The estimate of a quantity and its standard uncertainty are commonly
    associated with the mean and the standard deviation of a set of data obtained
    from measuring repeatedly the measurand (this procedure is known as ‘type A’ analysis).
    Both can be affected by the resolution of the measuring instrument. The resolution
    is the smallest difference between indications that can be distinguished and it
    is obviously limited in the case of digital instruments. In this paper, we characterize
    the effect of the limited resolution on a set of measurements. We realized that,
    if a certain minimum limit for the standard deviation of the measured data is
    not achieved, biased estimates and unrealistic uncertainties can be obtained.
    Beyond this limit, the influence of the resolution on the mean is insignificant
    and standard deviation includes the effect of resolution such that, in order to
    carry out the uncertainty evaluation, additional corrections appear to be unnecessary.</p>"
