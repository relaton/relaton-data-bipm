abstract:
- content: "<p>This communication reviews one method of calculating uncertainty intervals
    by Monte Carlo simulation, suggests that this method produces intervals that are
    slightly wider than is necessary and shows that a simpler, more intuitive, method
    generates narrower intervals. The analysis raises questions about the concept
    of describing measurands by probability distributions.</p>"
