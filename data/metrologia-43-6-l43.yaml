abstract:
- content: "<p>Willink (2004 Metrologia 41 L5â€“6) is concerned that, in the society
    of metrology, there is potential for confusion between coverage interval and statistical
    coverage interval and he makes a precise interpretaion of these two terms. We
    further clarify that the confidence of a coverage interval is actually a statistical
    coverage interval.</p>"
