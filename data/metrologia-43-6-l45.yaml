abstract:
- content: "<p>The calibration uncertainty of a standard platinum resistance thermometer
    (SPRT), as reported by a calibration laboratory in terms of the resistance-ratio
    with respect to the triple point of water (TPW), is strictly zero at the temperature
    of the TPW. This does not mean that when the instrument is used to measure a temperature
    close to the TPW the measurement uncertainty is zero.</p><p>This point is being
    explicitly emphasized in this short note for the benefit of colleagues at calibration
    laboratories and users of SPRTs.</p>"
