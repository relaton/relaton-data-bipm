  content: "<p>A workshop on statistical techniques for evaluating key comparison
    data in length metrology was held as part of the September 2005 meetings of the
    Working Group on Dimensional Metrology of the Consultative Committee for Length
    (CCL) of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. This paper summarizes
    the discussion at this workshop and the resulting recommendations, subsequently
    adopted by the CCL, for evaluating future key comparison data in dimensional metrology.
    Motivation and supporting information relating to the recommendations are included.</p>"
