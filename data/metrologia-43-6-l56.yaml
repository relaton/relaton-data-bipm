abstract:
- content: "<p>A computational method for processing measurement data is discussed
    that applies the law of propagation of uncertainty, which is described in the
    Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The method introduces the
    notion of an ‘uncertain number’, which is an entity that encapsulates information
    about the value and uncertainty of a quantity. Basic mathematical operations can
    be defined for uncertain numbers so that relationships between quantities can
    be expressed in a familiar way. Uncertain number equations can be arbitrarily
    combined, or decomposed into expressions for intermediate results, providing flexibility
    and convenience for automatic data processing while rigorously supporting uncertainty
    propagation. A geometrical description of simple uncertain number operations is
    also given.</p>"
