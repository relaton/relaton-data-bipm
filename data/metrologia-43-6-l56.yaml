  content: "<p>A computational method for processing measurement data is discussed
    that applies the law of propagation of uncertainty, which is described in the
    <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>. The method
    introduces the notion of an ‘uncertain number’, which is an entity that encapsulates
    information about the value and uncertainty of a quantity. Basic mathematical
    operations can be defined for uncertain numbers so that relationships between
    quantities can be expressed in a familiar way. Uncertain number equations can
    be arbitrarily combined, or decomposed into expressions for intermediate results,
    providing flexibility and convenience for automatic data processing while rigorously
    supporting uncertainty propagation. A geometrical description of simple uncertain
    number operations is also given.</p>"
