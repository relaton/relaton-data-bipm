  content: "<p>Since 1999, when the first high temperature fixed-points based on the
    metal窶田arbon eutectic phase transitions were realized, more than 60 papers have
    been published on this topic. Eutectic based fixed-points are already being considered
    as secondary reference points for the International Temperature Scale and have
    been introduced into industrial laboratories. This rapid progress has been possible
    through the combined effort of scientists around the world, from national metrology
    institutes, universities and industry. It has been proposed that these fixed-points
    should be officially adopted as a way to improve the realization and dissemination
    of temperature scales above the silver point. In radiometry, the availability
    of stable high temperature fixed-points will give greater flexibility and at some
    wavelengths the potential for greater accuracy for spectral radiance and irradiance
    scale realization. This paper summarizes the major progress in eutectic research
    so far.</p>"
