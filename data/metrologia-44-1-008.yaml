abstract:
- content: "<p>The free-field sensitivity of a microphone is related to the product
    of its pressure sensitivity, the scattering factor and the load of the radiation
    impedance on the diaphragm. The product of the last two factors describes how
    much the sensitivity of the microphone differs from its pressure sensitivity.
    The modulus of the ratio of the free-field sensitivity to the pressure sensitivity
    is called the free-field correction when expressed logarithmically. By definition,
    the free-field sensitivity implies that a plane wave is impinging on the microphone.
    However, in practice the free-field reciprocity technique is based on the substitution
    of the microphones by point sources with a given diffraction factor. At sufficiently
    long distances spherical waves approximate plane waves, but this may not be the
    case when the microphones are calibrated using the reciprocity technique where
    the microphones are usually quite close to each other. The problem has been analysed
    numerically and experimentally. Experimental values of the free-field correction
    are found to be in agreement with standardized values.</p>"
