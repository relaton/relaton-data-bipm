  content: "<p>The definitions of some units of the Système International are likely
    to be revised as early as 2011 by basing them on fixed values of fundamental constants
    of nature, provided experimental realizations are demonstrated with sufficiently
    small uncertainties. As regards the kilogram, experiments aiming at linking it
    to the Planck constant and the atomic mass constant are under way in several laboratories.
    The other units likely to be redefined are the ampere, the kelvin and the mole.
    We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different alternatives for revised
    definitions of the kilogram and the mole. From physical considerations, metrological
    consequences and ease of understanding, a definition of the kilogram based on
    the mass of a particle, such as an atom or the electron, is favoured. One of the
    proposed definitions fixes the value of the Planck constant through the Compton
    frequency of a material, though unphysical, particle. Finally, a redefinition
    of the mole, the counting unit of the amount-of-substance, is proposed which fixes
    the Avogadro constant as a dimensionless number.</p>"
