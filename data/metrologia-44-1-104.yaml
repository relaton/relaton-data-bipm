    <p>In this article, the same graph was inadvertently used in both figures
    2 and 3. Figure 3 was correct. Figure 2 should be replaced by the graph shown below. The
    authors are indebted to their colleague Giancarlo Marullo for pointing
    out this error.</p><p>.</p><p>Figure 2. L<sub>p</sub> estimator statistics for the normal distribution, versus p. Sample variance multiplied by the sample size n, nσ<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>, for the case n = 5 (•) and n = 50 (○). Asymptotic variance ω<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> (—).</p>
