  content: "<p>The quantum Hall resistance measured at frequencies in the kilohertz
    range shows frequency- and current-dependent deviations from the quantized dc
    resistance value. This has been attributed to capacitive effects which are reflected
    in the ac longitudinal resistance. Nulling the ac longitudinal resistance results
    in a frequency- and current-independent quantum Hall resistance. This criterion
    is in close analogy to the dc case and shows that the quantum Hall effect measured
    with ac is the same as with dc. This allows application as a primary standard
    of impedance.</p>"
