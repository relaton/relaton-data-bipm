  content: "<p>Verification of the actual quantity of product in prepackages is an
    important part of compliance testing to facilitate fair trade, maintain a competitive
    marketplace and protect consumers against under-filled prepackages. Two of the
    most widely used legal metrological requirements are (i) the average net quantity
    of product in prepackages of an inspection lot shall be at least equal to the
    labelled quantity and (ii) the number of prepackages, in a randomly selected sample,
    that are under-filled by more than a permitted quantity is less than or equal
    to a permitted number. Industrial and government metrology officials are required
    to check whether prepackages in an inspection lot comply with these requirements
    by sampling prepackages at the point-of-pack, wholesale outlets and retail stores.
    This paper discusses some drawbacks of the acceptance sampling plans and metrological
    requirements recommended in the international recommendation OIML R87 developed
    by the International Organization of Legal Metrology. To counter these drawbacks,
    alternative sampling plans and average prepackage requirements are proposed. Statistical
    control of filling processes under the OIML R87 requirements is also discussed.</p>"
