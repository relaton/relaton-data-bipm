abstract:
- content: "<p>The field distribution of a Gaussian light beam introduces additional
    space-dependent phase shifts compared with that of a flat wave front. An expression
    for these phase corrections is derived for the case of a two-beam interferometer.
    The contribution from these diffraction-induced shifts to the g-value determined
    in absolute gravimetry is calculated. It is found that in the case of a beam waist
    of a few millimetres or smaller and, particularly, for unbalanced interferometers,
    a careful consideration of this effect is crucial if high accuracy is desired.</p>"
