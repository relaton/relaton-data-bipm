abstract:
- content: "<p>The dimensions of the slots in eddy current (EC) reference standards
    are too narrow to be measured by general depth measurement methods such as the
    optical (laser) or stylus methods. However, measurement of the dimensions of the
    machined slots is a prerequisite to using the blocks as references. The present
    paper suggests a measurement method for the slotted section using an ultrasonic
    test. The width and depth of the slots measured in our study are roughly 0.1 mm
    and 0.5 mm, respectively. The time of flight (TOF) of the ultrasonic wave was
    measured precisely. The ultrasonic velocity in the material of the EC reference
    standard was calculated with the measured values of the TOF and its thickness.
    Reflected waves from the tip of the slot and the bottom surface of the EC standard
    were successfully classified. Using this method we have successfully determined
    the depth of the slotted section.</p>"
