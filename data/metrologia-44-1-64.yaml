abstract:
- content: "<p>A measurement method and associated uncertainty analysis have been
    developed for the measurement of propagation or group delay in electrical transmission
    lines and optical fibres. The measurement method and uncertainty analysis were
    applied to measurements of optical fibre delay lines that introduce tens of microseconds
    of delay (1 km, 2 km and 4 km fibre lengths) and trombone lines that introduce
    sub-nanosecond delays. For the measurement method described here, uncertainties
    in the measured delay are as low as 90 fs (95% confidence interval) for a propagation
    delay of 660 ps and less than 200 ps (95% confidence interval) for a propagation
    delay of 20 µs.</p>"
