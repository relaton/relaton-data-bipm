abstract:
- content: "<p>The close relationship between the SI units incorporating the proposed
    changes of Mills et al and the atomic system of units is discussed. It is shown
    that when the definition of the second is taken into account, a definition of
    the kilogram in terms of the mass of a photon of specified frequency results in
    a kilogram that implicitly depends on α<sup>4</sup>m<sub>e</sub> and other dimensionless
    constants, where α is the fine structure constant and m<sub>e</sub> is the electron
    rest mass. Thus the choice of definitions proposed by Mills et al implicitly yields
    a kilogram that depends either essentially on α<sup>4</sup>m<sub>e</sub> or on
    the unified atomic mass unit, m<sub>u</sub>. Consequently, the kilogram could
    be regarded as implicitly retaining its present status as an independently defined
    SI base unit with either definition. The α-dependence of the kilogram and many
    other SI quantities would, of course, be affected by future changes in the definition
    of the second.</p>"
