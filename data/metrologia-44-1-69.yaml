  content: "<p>The close relationship between the SI units incorporating the proposed
    changes of Mills <italic>et al</italic> and the atomic system of units is discussed.
    It is shown that when the definition of the second is taken into account, a definition
    of the kilogram in terms of the mass of a photon of specified frequency results
    in a kilogram that implicitly depends on α<sup>4</sup><italic>m</italic><sub>e</sub>
    and other dimensionless constants, where α is the fine structure constant and
    <italic>m</italic><sub>e</sub> is the electron rest mass. Thus the choice of definitions
    proposed by Mills <italic>et al</italic> implicitly yields a kilogram that depends
    either essentially on α<sup>4</sup><italic>m</italic><sub>e</sub> or on the unified
    atomic mass unit, <italic>m</italic><sub>u</sub>. Consequently, the kilogram could
    be regarded as implicitly retaining its present status as an independently defined
    SI base unit with either definition. The α-dependence of the kilogram and many
    other SI quantities would, of course, be affected by future changes in the definition
    of the second.</p>"
