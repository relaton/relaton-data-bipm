abstract:
- content: "<p>Two equations relating to the effect of finite resolution on the uncertainty
    of a sample mean give the impression of being contradictory. One suggests that
    knowing the data to be digitized increases uncertainty while the other might be
    thought to imply the opposite. This issue is clarified and relevant concepts are
    discussed. This discussion leads to the development of a new approximation relating
    to the uncertainty of an estimate obtained by taking the mean of a set of digital
    measurement results. This result is consistent with others published recently
    in implying that resolution error can usually be ignored in such a situation.
    The solution to this problem obtained in a Bayesian analysis with the usual non-informative
    prior distribution is shown to give an inappropriate result when all the observations
    are equal and to exhibit anomalous behaviour in certain other circumstances. One
    of the appendices describes an estimator that has smaller mean-square error than
    the sample mean when averaging over the set of measurement problems of this type.</p>"
