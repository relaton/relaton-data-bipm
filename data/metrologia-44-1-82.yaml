  content: "<p>There is a common misconception that the Avogadro constant is one of
    the fundamental constants of nature, in the same category as the speed of light,
    the Planck constant and the invariant masses of atomic-scale particles. Although
    the absolute mass of any specified atomic-scale entity is an invariant universal
    constant of nature, the Avogadro constant relating this to a macroscopic quantity
    is not. Rather, it is a man-made construct, designed by convention to define a
    convenient unit relating the atomic and macroscopic scales. The misportrayal seems
    to stem from the widespread use of the term ‘fixed-Avogadro-constant’ for describing
    a redefinition of the kilogram that is, in fact, based on a fixed atomic-scale
    particle mass. This paper endeavours to clarify the role of the Avogadro constant
    in current definitions of SI units for mass and amount of substance as well as
    recently proposed redefinitions of these units—in particular, those based on fixing
    the numerical values of the Planck and Avogadro constants, respectively. Precise
    definitions lead naturally to a rational, straightforward and intuitively obvious
    construction of appropriate (exactly defined) atomic-scale units for these quantities.
    And this, in turn, suggests a direct and easily comprehended two-part statement
    of the fixed-Planck-constant kilogram definition involving a well-understood and
    physically meaningful de Broglie–Compton frequency.</p>"
