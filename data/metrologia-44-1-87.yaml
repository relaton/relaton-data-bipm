    <p>Equilibrium melting curves of nominally 99.9999% pure Al–Cu eutectic samples were realized. The end of the linear portion of the melting curves, the run-off point, was found to be (548.1608 ± 0.0007) °C. The uncertainty is one standard deviation of the twelve measured values.</p>
    <p>Some of the samples were then doped with Si, Fe and Ag. These impurities shifted their run-off points by −0.68 mK ppm<sup>−1</sup>, −0.29 mK ppm<sup>−1</sup> and −0.17 mK ppm<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.</p>
