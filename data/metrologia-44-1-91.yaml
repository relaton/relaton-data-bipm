abstract:
- content: "<p>A theory is presented for estimating the uncertainty of a frequency
    comparison in the presence of distributed dead time or measurement interval offset
    using an extension of the method of Douglas and Boulanger (1997 Proc. 11th European
    Frequency and Time Forum pp 345â€“9). The uncertainties due to the distributed dead
    time and lumped dead time with mixed power law noise type are calculated and compared.
    It is shown that the use of distributed measurements of frequencies can greatly
    reduce the uncertainty as compared with that of lumped measurements. When a measurement
    interval offset is present, two different methods are possible for the frequency
    estimation and uncertainty evaluation. We compare and discuss the different results
    for the different methods.</p>"
