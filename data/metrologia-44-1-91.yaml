  content: "<p>A theory is presented for estimating the uncertainty of a frequency
    comparison in the presence of distributed dead time or measurement interval offset
    using an extension of the method of Douglas and Boulanger (1997 <italic>Proc.
    11th European Frequency and Time Forum</italic> pp 345â€“9). The uncertainties due
    to the distributed dead time and lumped dead time with mixed power law noise type
    are calculated and compared. It is shown that the use of distributed measurements
    of frequencies can greatly reduce the uncertainty as compared with that of lumped
    measurements. When a measurement interval offset is present, two different methods
    are possible for the frequency estimation and uncertainty evaluation. We compare
    and discuss the different results for the different methods.</p>"
