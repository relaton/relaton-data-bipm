    <p>At 17 national metrology institutes (NMI) of EUROMET member states, electrical standards of low-frequency (50/60 Hz) power were compared to establish the relationship between the electrical unit of AC power at these laboratories. The results of this comparison are described. The differences between most laboratory's values and the reference values were within the expanded measurement uncertainties at a coverage factor  <italic>k</italic> = 2.</p>
