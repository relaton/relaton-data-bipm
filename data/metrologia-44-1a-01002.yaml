    <p>The report describes the organization, equipment and results of the EUROMET.EM-S20 supplementary comparison "Intercomparison of a 100 mH inductance standard", in the context of the EUROMET Project no. 607. The comparison took place from November 2002 to June 2003, and involved seven participants. The travelling standard was purposely built from a General Radio 1482-L inductor, thermostatted and configured to be measured as a two-terminal or as a four-terminal-pair impedance. Participants from national metrology institutes measured it as a two-terminal standard at the frequency of 1 kHz, and a reference value was determined for this configuration with a relative uncertainty of 4.2 µH/H. All estimates reported by the participants are in agreement with the reference value, within the corresponding expanded uncertainties (95% level of confidence).</p>
    <p>The travelling standard and a part of the comparison protocol are at present being employed in the organization of the EUROMET.EM-S26 follow-up comparison, in the context of the EUROMET Project no. 816.</p>
