    <p>This report presents the comparison results of measurements using two electronic DC reference standards performed by national metrology institutes in the COOMET region. This comparison provides an indirect link between voltage realizations of BelGIM and BIPM through VNIIM results obtained in voltage standard key comparisons with those of the BIPM. In the KCDB, the difference between BelGIM and BIPM is given together with the combined uncertainty of measurements BelGIM − VNIIM and VNIIM − BIPM. The results of the comparison, in terms of degrees of equivalence, show that there is a good agreement between the measurement results of the participants. The results also show that the low Josephson voltage (8 mV) reproduced by the BelGIM voltage standard and the time-dependent fluctuations in the output voltages of the travelling standards are the main sources of uncertainty.</p><p>Main text.
