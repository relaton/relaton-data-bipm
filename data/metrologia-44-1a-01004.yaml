    <p>A key comparison of resistance standards at 100 Ω started in 2001. The pilot laboratory, seven national metrological institutes and the BIPM participated in that comparison. Within an expanded measurement uncertainty (k = 2) of 2 × 10<sup>-8</sup> the results of the participants agreed with the key comparison reference value. The comparison was limited by the transport behaviour of the travelling standards and hence does not reflect the actual calibration capabilities of the participants.</p><p>Main text.
