    <p>The key comparison report CCEM.RF-K21.F describes the comparison of antenna factor, at 300 MHz and 900 MHz, measured for a commercially available tuned dipole antenna when positioned horizontally 2 m above a large conducting ground plane. This is similar to a previous comparison of antenna factor (CCEM.RF-K7b.F) which was completed in 1999. The unit of antenna factor is commonly used for EMC testing and it expresses the ratio of  <italic>E</italic>-field to received voltage across a 50 Ω termination. The traceability of this quantity requires reference to some or all of the following standards: length, voltage, power and attenuation. The precise traceability route depended on the calibration method used by each of the nine participating laboratories, which included the use of both indoor (semi-anechoic) and outdoor facilities. The agreement between the laboratories was excellent and supports the mutual equivalence between these national measurement institutes. The measurements were carried out between January 2002 and September 2004.</p>
