    <p>The supplementary comparison report CCEM.RF-S21.F describes the comparison of free space antenna factor for two types of wire antenna in the range 30 MHz to 2 GHz. One of these antennas was a biconical/LPDA hybrid (or bilog) type antenna, which is becoming very popular in the EMC world and poses some calibration problems because they are physically large and they have a wide frequency range. This work is similar to a previous comparison of antenna factor above 30 MHz (CCEM.RF-K7b.F) which was completed in 1999. In addition to this the CCEM.RF-S21.F comparison included three low frequency antennas: an active monopole, an active loop and a passive loop, all calibrated at various frequencies between 20 Hz and 30 MHz. The unit of antenna factor is commonly used for EMC testing and it expresses the ratio of field strength to received voltage across a 50 Ω termination. The traceability of this quantity requires reference to some or all of the following standards: length, voltage, power and attenuation. For the wire antennas the agreement between the laboratories was excellent and supports the mutual equivalence between these national measurement institutes. There was also good agreement found for the loop and monopole results; however, the monopole data highlighted a known problem associated with the lack of detailed guidance in the published standards for the equivalent capacitance method of calibration. The measurements were carried out between February 2002 and April 2004.</p>
