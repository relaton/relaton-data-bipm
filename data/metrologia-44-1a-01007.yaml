abstract:
- content: "<p>The report describes the results of a comparison of measurement methods
    of the scale factor of high voltage dividers at voltages up to 100 kV. Eight laboratories
    took part in the comparison. The measurements were carried out in the period between
    September 1999 and March 2001. The travelling standard was a resistive divider
    composed of wire wound resistors. Measurements were carried out at voltages of
    10 kV, 50 kV and 100 kV for scale factors of 100 000, 10 000 and 1000. Some laboratories
    also made measurements at an optional scale factor of 50 000. For the scale factor
    of 1000 measurements were also made at 1 kV. In general the measurements made
    by the participants were in agreement.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EUROMET, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
