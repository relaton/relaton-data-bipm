    <p>The report describes the results of a comparison of measurement methods of the  scale factor of high voltage dividers at voltages up to 100 kV. Eight laboratories took part in the comparison. The measurements were carried out in the period between September 1999 and March 2001. The travelling standard was a resistive divider composed of wire wound resistors. Measurements were carried out at voltages of 10 kV, 50 kV and 100 kV for scale factors of 100 000, 10 000 and 1000. Some laboratories also made measurements at an optional scale factor of 50 000. For the scale factor of 1000 measurements were also made at 1 kV. In general the measurements made by the participants were in agreement.</p>
