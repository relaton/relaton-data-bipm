    <p>The circulation of the travelling standard in the CIPM key comparison CCEM-K11 of ac–dc voltage transfer difference at low voltages began in September 2001 and was completed in September 2003. Out of the eleven participants one NMI withdrew without having performed any measurements due to the staff situation. One NMI withdrew before the draft A report and later participated in a subsequent bilateral key comparison CCEM-K11.1 that was performed in August–September 2004.</p><p>The ac–dc transfer differences of the travelling standard have been measured at 100 mV and 10 mV and at the frequencies 1 kHz, 20 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz. The key comparison reference values (KCRV) were calculated as the weighted mean of the results of the nine NMIs in CCEM-K11. The degrees of equivalence with the KCRV and between pairs of NMIs have been determined for the measuring points and show very good agreement. All the calculated deviations are within the limits of the expanded uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.
