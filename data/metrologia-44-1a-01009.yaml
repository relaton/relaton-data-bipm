    <p>This report presents the results of a trilateral comparison of measurements on a Zener voltage standard within the framework of EUROMET. The participants are the national metrology institutes of Romania (INM), Turkey (UME) and Austria (BEV); BEV acted as the pilot laboratory. The comparison was performed in order to link the National Institute of Metrology Bucharest (INM) to the BIPM key comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
