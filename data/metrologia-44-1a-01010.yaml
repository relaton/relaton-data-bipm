    <p>The results and the measurement methods of the EUROMET comparison 525 are summarized in this report. The task of the comparison was to determine the calibration factor for frequencies up to 26 GHz of two identical RF power sensors with PC 3.5 mm connector in the coaxial 3.5 mm line system. Eight European national metrology institutes (NMIs) participated in this comparison, which was organized as a successor to the CCEM key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/01009">CCEM.RF-K10.CL</ext-link> on the same subject. Two RF power travelling standards with male PC 3.5 mm connectors were measured at:  <bold>EIM</bold> (Greece),  <bold>AREPA</bold> (Denmark),  <bold>BNM-LCIE</bold> (France),  <bold>NPL</bold> (United Kingdom),  <bold>NMI-VSL</bold> (Netherlands),  <bold>SP</bold> (Sweden),  <bold>UME</bold> (Turkey), with  <bold>PTB</bold> (Germany) as the pilot laboratory.</p>
