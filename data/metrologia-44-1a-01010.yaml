abstract:
- content: "<p>The results and the measurement methods of the EUROMET comparison 525
    are summarized in this report. The task of the comparison was to determine the
    calibration factor for frequencies up to 26 GHz of two identical RF power sensors
    with PC 3.5 mm connector in the coaxial 3.5 mm line system. Eight European national
    metrology institutes (NMIs) participated in this comparison, which was organized
    as a successor to the CCEM key comparison CCEM.RF-K10.CL on the same subject.
    Two RF power travelling standards with male PC 3.5 mm connectors were measured
    at: EIM (Greece), AREPA (Denmark), BNM-LCIE (France), NPL (United Kingdom), NMI-VSL
    (Netherlands), SP (Sweden), UME (Turkey), with PTB (Germany) as the pilot laboratory.</p><p>Main

    text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
