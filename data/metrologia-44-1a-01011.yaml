    <p>A comparison of Josephson voltage standards (JVS) between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Centro Nacional
    de Metrología (CENAM) held at CENAM from 21 to 23 March 2006 is reported. The comparison was made at the 10 V level by measuring four Zener references using the JVS of CENAM and the transportable Compact Josephson Voltage Standard (CJVS) of NIST. The difference between the measurements was –34.7 nV with an uncertainty of 43.2 nV at 95% level of confidence.</p><p>Main text.
