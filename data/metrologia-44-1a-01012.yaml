    <p>The key comparison EUROMET.EM-K6.a was a bilateral comparison between PTB, Germany and BIM, Bulgaria and is linked to the corresponding comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/39/1A/2/">CCEM-K6.a</ext-link>, in which PTB participated. It is aimed at the following objectives:
     <list list-type="unordered">
     <list-item><p>Demonstration of international equivalence of BIM AC–DC Voltage Transfer Standard;</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>Demonstration of equivalence of metrological practice in measurements of AC–DC Voltage Transfer Difference;</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>Proof of the correctness of calibration results;</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>Proof of the correct traceability of the standards.</p></list-item>
    </list>
    The quantitity to be compared was the ac–dc voltage transfer difference of the travelling standard, a Fluke 792A AC/DC Transfer Standard, at 3 V and at frequencies 1 kHz, 20 kHz and 100 kHz. The obtained results show very good agreement with the reference value within the expanded uncertainties.</p>
