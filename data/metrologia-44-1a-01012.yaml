- content: |-
    <p>The key comparison EUROMET.EM-K6.a was a bilateral comparison between PTB, Germany and BIM, Bulgaria and is linked to the corresponding comparison CCEM-K6.a, in which PTB participated. It is aimed at the following objectives:<p>Demonstration of international equivalence of BIM AC–DC Voltage Transfer Standard;</p><p>Demonstration of equivalence of metrological practice in measurements of AC–DC Voltage Transfer Difference;</p><p>Proof of the correctness of calibration results;</p><p>Proof of the correct traceability of the standards.</p>

    The quantitity to be compared was the ac–dc voltage transfer difference of the travelling standard, a Fluke 792A AC/DC Transfer Standard, at 3 V and at frequencies 1 kHz, 20 kHz and 100 kHz. The obtained results show very good agreement with the reference value within the expanded uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.
