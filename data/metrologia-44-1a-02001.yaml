    <p>APMP.PR-S1, a supplementary comparison of irradiance responsivity of UVA detectors, was carried out among seven national metrology institutes piloted by SPRING Singapore from 2003 to 2005. Two quantities, the narrow band UV (365 nm ± 5 nm) irradiance responsivity and the broad band UVA (315 nm–400 nm) irradiance responsivity of the transfer detectors, have been compared. Commercial UV source (medium pressure mercury short arc lamp) and UVA detectors were used as transfer standards in the comparison. Measurement results from participants were reported and their uncertainties associated with the comparison were analysed in this report. The method of weighted mean with cut-off was used to calculate the comparison reference values. The results from most participating labs lie within ±5% against the comparison reference values with a few exceptions. The degree of agreement of the comparison depends not only on the base scales of spectral responsivity and spectral irradiance of a laboratory, but also equally importantly on the method used for the measurement.</p><p>Main text.
