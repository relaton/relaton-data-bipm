- content: |-
    <p>After completion of the intercomparison of chromatic dispersion reference fibres that was carried out under EUROMET Project 666 (EUROMET-PR.S1), MIKES asked for a new bilateral intercomparison, in order to validate the corrective modifications that they made on their measurement system. This work was carried out using the same rules and technical procedures that were applied for EUROMET-PR.S1 and by measuring two fibres, namely one G655-Leaf and one G653 fibre. Measurements of the total chromatic dispersion, of the zero dispersion wavelength and of the dispersion slope were performed. The long term stability of both reference fibres was checked by comparing METAS calibration results obtained during EUROMET-PR.S1 with measurements performed during this bilateral intercomparison (EUROMET-PR.S1.1). No significant deviation was observed, neither for the chromatic dispersion D, nor for the zero dispersion wavelength λ<sub>0</sub> and for the dispersion slope S<sub>0</sub>. This bilateral intercomparison allowed validation of the modified measurement system of MIKES and also provided the link to the results of the EUROMET-PR.S1 project.</p><p>Main text.
