    <p>This report presents the results of the EUROMET regional key comparison corresponding to  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/39/2/7/">CCT-K3</ext-link> and covering the temperature range from 83.8058 K (triple point of Ar) to 692.77 K (freezing point of Zn).</p>
    <p>The comparison involved the six NMIs previously involved in CCT-K3 (BNM-INM/CNAM, SMU, IMGC, NMi-VSL, NPL, PTB) and 18 European national laboratories. The comparison was divided into five different loops coordinated by a co-pilot chosen among the laboratories having participated in the CCT-K3 comparison. BNM-INM/CNAM played the role of pilot in establishing the link between the five loops. In each loop, an artefact in the form of a standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) was circulated among the participant laboratories. In order to have sufficient information about the possible drift of the SPRTs, the co-pilots have performed a calibration over the full temperature range at the beginning and at the end of the loop.</p>
    <p>Each participant laboratory carried out the measurements in agreement with the protocol. After initial measurements of  <italic>R</italic>(tpw) and successful annealing treatment, each calibration consisted of three measurements of  <italic>R</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) at each fixed point, in separate realizations. Each measurement was followed by a measurement of  <italic>R</italic>(tpw). The order of fixed points was Zn, Sn, In, Ga, Hg, Ar, but if a fixed point was not available, it was omitted. Values of  <italic>W</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), and their average value, were calculated. The results were reported to the co-pilot and BNM-INM/CNAM, with uncertainty budgets and other specified data.</p>
    <p>The results of the comparison were analysed by BNM-INM/CNAM. For the sake of clarity, the results are firstly presented loop by loop. In a second step a EUROMET Reference Value (ERV) taking into account the whole comparison was defined. In order to calculate this ERV advantage was taken of the presence of BNM-INM/CNAM in the five loops; the differences between each laboratory's results and BNM-INM's were considered. The participant laboratories decided during a Workshop organized by the pilot in Vienna in April 2005 to use as ERV the weighted mean rather than the simple mean.</p>
    <p>The differences (<italic>T</italic><sub>Lab</sub> -  <italic>T</italic><sub>ERV</sub>) are presented with the associated uncertainties. Given that the protocol of the comparison contains a detailed description of how the uncertainties are to be calculated, the uncertainty budgets established by the participants seem consistent or, at least, homogeneous.</p>
    <p>The degrees of equivalence between the participating laboratories (in the same loop or in different loops) are given with their associated uncertainty.</p>
    <p>Finally, a method for establishing the bilateral equivalence between the participants in CCT-K3 and in EUROMET'T-K3 is proposed. It is recommend to use a group of 'linking laboratories' composed by the pilot and the co-pilots in order to link EUROMET.T-K3 to CCT-K3. The hypothesis is that the mean temperature of the pilot and co-pilot laboratories is the same in EUROMET.T-K3 as it was in CCT-K3. A specific analysis of the pilot's and co-pilot's results shows that even when the results given by one or several members of the 'linking laboratories' are not positioned in the same place as in EUROMET.T-K3 and CCT-K3 the mean calculated for the group is really reproducible.</p>
