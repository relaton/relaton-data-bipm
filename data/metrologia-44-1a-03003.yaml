    <p>An APMP supplementary comparison of local realization of radiation temperatures from 400 °C to 2000 °C using a radiation thermometer as a transfer standard was carried out among five national laboratories from October 2000 to September 2003. The NMIJ acted as the pilot laboratory. An NMIJ Topcon-148 radiation thermometer with centre wavelength 0.9 µm was hand-carried to each participating laboratory where its scale was calibrated against the standard radiation thermometer of each laboratory using each laboratory's comparison blackbodies. The transfer radiation thermometer was calibrated by NMIJ before and after measurements by each laboratory, and showed drifts less than 0.05 °C below 1000 °C rising to 0.3 °C at 2000 °C. Some institutes only performed measurements over a sub-range of 400 °C to 2000 °C; however, all institutes performed measurements in the region 600 °C to 1100 °C. In this common region an APMP average was calculated, and all laboratories were within 0.25 °C of this average value.</p>
