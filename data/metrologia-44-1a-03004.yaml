    <p>The final report of the Asia-Pacific Metrology (APMP) regional supplementary intercomparison, APMP-T-S1-04, of Type R (Pt–13%Rh) thermocouples from 0 °C to 1100 °C is presented. This comparison was piloted by the National Measurement Institute of Australia (NMIA) and involved twelve national metrology institutes from the APMP: NMIA, NIM, SCL, NPLI, KIM-LIPI, NMIJ, KRISS, SIRIM, SPRING, CSIR, CMS and NIMT. The comparison used a star-type topology in which the pilot laboratory calibrated 11 thermocouples, which were distributed to the participants and finally recalibrated by the pilot. NMIA also determined the inhomogeneity of each thermocouple by thermoelectric scanning in an oil bath, and these values were used by the participants in their uncertainty analysis. To reduce the effect of reversible Rh oxidation, all participants performed the calibrations in the same 450 °C annealed state.</p><p>The simple mean, median and weighted mean were mutually consistent, but since the Birge criterion was safely satisfied, the weighted mean was adopted, achieving a k = 2 uncertainty ranging from 0.03 °C to 0.06 °C over 0 °C to 1100 °C. The pilot laboratory reproducibility was typically 0.04 °C (k = 2), allowing the statistically significant testing of the calibration capabilities of all participants.</p><p>Main text.
