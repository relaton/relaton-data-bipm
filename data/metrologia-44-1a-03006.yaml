    <p>Following the  CCT-K3, the Asia-Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) coordinated a corresponding regional key comparison over the period 2000 to 2003, involving 12 NMIs of the APMP: NMIA, SPRING, CSIR, NIMT, NPL(India), MUSSL, SIRIM, KRISS, KIM-LIPI, SCL, CMS and ITDI.  The link between the regional and key comparisons was provided by NMIA (Australia) and KRISS (Korea). A similar protocol to the CCT-K3 was adopted, but the temperature range was restricted to the range -38.8344 °C to 419.527 °C to reduce potential instability in the transfer SPRT used as an artifact. Prior to circulation the artifact was characterized by repeated calibrations, and then hand carried around two loops of 7 and 4 other NMIs. The linkage mechanism between CCT and APMP comparisons did not significantly contribute to the overall uncertainties of the laboratories' results.</p><p>This report describes the details of the artifact, the circulation schedule, the measurement procedures, the results and uncertainties submitted by the participants, and the analysis of the results.  The pilot laboratory correlated calibration drifts in the transfer SPRT with changes in its  R<sub>TPW</sub> (the SPRT resistance at the water triple point) and used this as a sensitivity factor to estimate the uncertainty due to SPRT drift during circulation. The SPRT drift varied between laboratories, but was typically from 0.1 mK at Hg to 0.6 mK at Zn. Differences between the pilot and each participant laboratory and the bilateral differences to the participants of the CCT-K3 were calculated via the two link laboratories. Finally, the difference to a 'post-comparison' reference value (the 'ARV'), used for evaluating CMCs, was calculated. The analysis included the effects of correlation of uncertainties and changes in national standard cells between the CCT and APMP comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
