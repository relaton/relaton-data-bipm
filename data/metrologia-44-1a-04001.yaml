    <p>Results of the Stage One portion of the Inter-American System of Metrology (SIM) regional international comparison of gauge block calibration by optical interferometry are presented. In this measurement round-robin, short gauge blocks, six made of steel and six made of tungsten carbide, in the range of nominal length from 2 mm to 100 mm, were calibrated by five national metrology institutes (NMIs) of the SIM region, and one NMI from EUROMET. By employing the technique of optical interferometry, each of the laboratories establishes a direct link to their national primary standard of length through the calibrated laser wavelengths. Results of central length calibration are presented and discussed with regard to vacuum wavelength correction for refractive index of air, phase-change on re.ection and wringing effects. Measurement uncertainty evaluation is also discussed.</p><p>Main text.
