    <p>Lasers from three national metrological institutes (NMIs) have been measured following the protocol of the BIPM.L-K11 ongoing key comparison initiated by the Comité Consultative des Longueurs (CCL) 11th meeting in 2003. The absolute frequency of the f component of the R(127) 11-5 transition at 633 nm was measured for two of these lasers in their home institutes, AIST/NMIJ and UME, while the b<sub>5</sub> component of the R(106) 28-0 transition at 543 nm was measured on a standard from NIM at the BIPM. The results of these measurements are compiled in the present paper. The comparison reports, as communicated by each participant, are included as Appendices.</p>
