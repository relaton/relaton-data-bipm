    <p>Lasers from eight national metrological institutes (NMIs) were brought to the NIM in Bejing in November 2004 for the APMP.L-K11 regional comparison. The frequency difference between the f components of the R(127) 11-5 transition was measured for these lasers following the Protocol for BIPM.L-K11. The absolute frequencies of three of the participating lasers have been measured with the comb technique either before or after the comparison. The absolute frequencies for the other lasers were then deduced using the three lasers as a link. The results of these measurements are compiled in the present paper. The comparison reports, as communicated by each participant, are included as Appendices.</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
