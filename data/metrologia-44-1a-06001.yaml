    <p>A COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Am-241 comparison of the measurement of a standardized solution of Am-241 has enabled two national metrology institutes in the COOMET to demonstrate their traceability to the SI. The results of this comparison will be used to evaluate degrees of equivalence for these institutes through the measurements of the linking laboratory in the key comparison BIPM.RI(II)K-1.Am-241.</p><p>Main text.
