abstract:
- content: "<p>In 1998, five national metrology institutes (NMI), an international
    laboratory and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) took part
    in a comparison of activity measurements of<sup>237</sup>Np as part of the EUROMET
    project No 416 comparison identifier EUROMET.RI(II)-K2.Np-237. The nominal activity
    per mass of the<sup>237</sup>Np solution distributed was 150 kBq g<sup>-1</sup>.
    The three ampoules received by the BIPM for this comparison were also measured
    in the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the BIPM
    (identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Np-237). Two other participants to the EUROMET comparison
    also submitted ampoules of the same<sup>237</sup>Np solution to the SIR. These
    SIR measurements enable the EUROMET comparison to be linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Np-237.
    The degrees of equivalence between each laboratory and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a graph
    and matrix for the three SIR participants and four other NMIs from the EUROMET
    comparison.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
