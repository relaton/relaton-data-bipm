abstract:
- content: "<p>For quality assurance in the realization and transfer by the national
    standard laboratories of the unit of the absorbed dose rate at 0.07 mm tissue
    depth for beta radiation, comparison measurements among the primary standard facilities
    are needed. Although some bilateral comparisons have taken place for this quantity,
    the CCRI decided in May 2003 that a EUROMET supplementary comparison would be
    appropriate if inclusive of primary standards laboratories of other regional metrology
    organizations. The operation and results of such a comparison are reported here.
    A flat ionization chamber and measurement system was used as the transfer instrument.
    A comparison was made of the calibration coefficients of this transfer instrument
    in various beta-particle laboratory reference fields (Pm-147, Kr-85, Tl-204 and
    Sr-90/Y-90) measured by each of the eight participants from France, Italy, Finland,
    Germany, Russian Federation, USA, Canada and Japan. The PTB was the pilot laboratory
    and the comparison ran from January 2004 until April 2007 under EUROMET project
    No 739 and EUROMET.RI(I)-S2. The results for most of the participants are consistent
    with the stated uncertainties although an extreme deviation is apparent for Pm-147
    beta radiation for one participant.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of

    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EUROMET, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
