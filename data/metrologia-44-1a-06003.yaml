    <p>For quality assurance in the realization and transfer by the national standard laboratories of the unit of the absorbed dose rate at 0.07 mm tissue depth for beta radiation, comparison measurements among the primary standard facilities are needed.  Although some bilateral comparisons have taken place for this quantity, the CCRI decided in May 2003 that a EUROMET supplementary comparison would be appropriate if inclusive of primary standards laboratories of other regional metrology organizations. The operation and results of such a comparison are reported here. A flat ionization chamber and measurement system was used as the transfer instrument. A comparison was made of the calibration coefficients of this transfer instrument in various beta-particle laboratory reference fields (Pm-147, Kr-85, Tl-204 and Sr-90/Y-90) measured by each of the eight participants from France, Italy, Finland, Germany, Russian Federation, USA, Canada and Japan. The PTB was the pilot laboratory and the comparison ran from January 2004 until April 2007 under EUROMET project No 739 and EUROMET.RI(I)-S2. The results for most of the participants are consistent with the stated uncertainties although an extreme deviation is apparent for Pm-147 beta radiation for one participant.</p>
