abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2005, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), India, and the Comisión
    Nacional de Energía Atómica (CNEA), Argentina, each submitted one sample of known
    activity of<sup>134</sup>Cs to the International Reference System (SIR). This
    was followed in 2006 by the submission of an ampoule by the Institutul de Fizica
    si Inginerie Nucleara (IFIN-HH), Romania. The values of the activity submitted
    were between about 0.7 MBq and 1.3 MBq. The 2005 results replace earlier SIR measurements
    while the 2006 result of the IFIN-HH replaces a CCRI(II) comparison result of
    1978. Consequently, there are now thirteen results in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-134
    comparison for which the key comparison reference value has been updated.</p><p>Also,
    in 2005, the APMP ran a key comparison for the activity of this radionuclide and
    the results are now linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-134 comparison through the
    previous submissions of the pilot laboratory, NMIJ (Japan), and of the LNE-LNHB
    (France). This has enabled the VNIIM (Russian Federation) to update its result
    from the 1978 CCRI(II)-K2.Cs-134 comparison and the INER (Chinese Taipei) to be
    linked for the first time. In addition, the remaining eight eligible results from
    the 1978 CCRI(II) comparison are still linked provisionally to the SIR results.</p><p>

    database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved
    for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
