abstract:
- content: "<p>International comparisons of air kerma have been made at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) since 1975. Twenty-one national metrology
    institutes have taken part, some of which have repeated the comparison over the
    years. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) is unity, each comparison result
    being the ratio of the national metrology institute (NMI) evaluation to that of
    the BIPM standard. The degrees of equivalence between each NMI and the KCRV, and
    between each pair of NMIs, are given in the form of a matrix, using the most recent
    published result of the past ten years for each of fifteen NMIs. A graphical presentation
    is also given.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on
    \ Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
