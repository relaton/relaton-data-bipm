    <p>International comparisons of air kerma have been made at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) since 1975. Twenty-one national metrology institutes have taken part, some of which have repeated the comparison over the years. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) is unity, each comparison result being the ratio of the national metrology institute (NMI) evaluation to that of the BIPM standard. The degrees of equivalence between each NMI and the KCRV, and between each pair of NMIs, are given in the form of a matrix, using the most recent published result of the past ten years for each of fifteen NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
