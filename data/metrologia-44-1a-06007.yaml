abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1977, seven national metrology institutes (NMIs) have submitted
    eleven samples of known activity of<sup>241</sup>Am to the International Reference
    System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et
    Mesures (BIPM). The activities ranged from about 1.9 MBq to 17 MBq. The results
    of the CCRI(II)-K2.Am-241 comparison held in 2003 with twenty-one participants
    have been linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Am-241 results using the submission to
    the SIR by the NPL of two ampoules of the mother solution of the CCRI(II) comparison.
    This has enabled four NMIs to update their earlier SIR results and fifteen NMIs,
    the IRMM and the BIPM to have their result published, the previous international
    comparison of<sup>241</sup>Am having been held over 40 years ago. The results
    of a COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Am-241 comparison held in 2006 have also been linked to
    the SIR results. This is possible through the submission to the SIR of an ampoule
    of the comparison by the pilot laboratory, the VNIIM. This has enabled two further
    NMIs to have degrees of equivalence for activity measurements for this radionuclide.
    The key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been updated to include the recent
    NPL and VNIIM results. The degree of equivalence between each equivalent activity
    measured in the SIR, or linked to the SIR, and the KCRV has been calculated and
    the results are given in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also
    given. Degrees of equivalence between pairs of participants are similarly given
    as a matrix.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI(II), according to the provisions of the
    CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
