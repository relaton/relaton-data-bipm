abstract:
- content: "<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the
    NIM and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards
    to be in general agreement at the level of twice the stated relative standard
    uncertainty of 3.1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>, although there is evidence of a trend in
    the results at different radiation qualities. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
