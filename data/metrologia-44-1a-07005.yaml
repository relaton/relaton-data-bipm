    <p>CCM.FF-K1, a key comparison (KC) for water flow, has been performed among six national metrology institutes (NMIs). These were SP–Sweden, PTB–Germany, NEL–UK representing EUROMET, CENAM–Mexico representing SIM, and NMIJ–Japan, KRISS–Korea representing APMP. KRISS served as the Pilot Laboratory.</p><p>In order to quantify the measurement uncertainties of water flow standard facilities at the level of 0.1% or better, a transfer standard package (TSP) comprising two stable high-precision flowmeters and a comprehensive KC procedure were designed. Specifically, the test procedure needed to generate measurements that were statistically sufficient to attain a high confidence level in the desired results. The K1 comparisons were conducted over the period from September 2003 to March 2005.</p><p>From each participating NMI, test results from a Coriolis meter and a turbine meter in four different flow conditions were reported with corresponding uncertainty budgets. Uncertainties of the key comparison were estimated based on the reported uncertainty budgets. As KCRVs, medians from key comparison results for the Coriolis meter and turbine meter in four different flow conditions were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. The final report presents the degree of equivalence between NMIs and KCRVs as well as the degree of equivalence between NMIs. In addition the report shows corresponding E<sub>n</sub> values.</p><p>Main text.
