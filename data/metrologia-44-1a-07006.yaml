    <p>Key comparisons (KCs) have been organized between the German National Standard  <italic>pigsar</italic><sup>TM</sup>, which disseminates the so-called European Harmonized Reference Value, and the Canadian National Standard Trans Canada Calibration (TCC).</p>
    <p>The National Facility  <italic>pigsar</italic><sup>TM</sup> disseminates the European Harmonized Reference Value, which is identical with the CIPM-KCRV as described in the protocol of the Key Comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/07001">CCM.FF-K5a</ext-link>.  The Canadian National Facility TCC as a secondary facility has been made traceable recently to the European Harmonized Reference Value. The intention of this CCM-FF-K5.a.1 was to proof the degree of equivalence between TCC and the European Harmonized Reference Value, the K5a-KCRV.</p>
    <p>The Canadian National Research Council (Institute for National Measurement Standards), as the responsible metrological authority for the dissemination of the natural gas cubic metre in Canada, wanted to get a verification of the quality of the Canadian disseminated reference value at the highest metrological level.  Therefore, a bilateral Key Comparison (K5.a.1) has been organized and piloted by PTB in Germany.</p>
    <p>It turned out that TCC is at all flow rates in full agreement with the European Harmonized Reference Values within its claimed uncertainty (and even better; for more details we refer to the full report). This ensures that the European facilities as well as now the Canadian one disseminate the best available realization of the gas cubic metre at high pressure, namely the KC, to their customers. In this respect the K5a Key Comparisons have a very high economic impact for all customers.</p>
