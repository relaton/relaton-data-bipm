    <p>A bilateral comparison was carried out in order to test the degree of equivalence between the newly established pressure balances of the Czech Metrological Institute and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The comparison was carried out without using a transfer standard, but with a differential capacitance diaphragm gauge as an indicator of the small differential pressure between the two pressure balances when the target pressures were generated in the two systems. The Czech Metrological Institute brought its force balanced piston gauge FPG by the DHI company to the site of the PTB pressure balance, which was a Furness Rosenberg system FRS 5 by the Furness company. In the range under comparison from 30 Pa to 7000 Pa full equivalence was obtained with the  <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub> value ranging from 0.01 to 0.47.</p>
