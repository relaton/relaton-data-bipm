    <p>CCM.FF-K3, a key comparison (KC) for air speed, has been performed among four national metrology institutes (NMIs). These were NMi–Netherlands and PTB–Germany, representing EUROMET, NIST–USA representing SIM, and NMIJ–Japan representing APMP. NMIJ served as the Pilot Laboratory.</p>
    <p>An ultrasonic anemometer had been chosen as a transfer standard and was circulated among the participants over the period from April 2005 to December 2005. Each participant reported calibration results at 2 m/s and 20 m/s with corresponding uncertainty budgets. At 20 m/s, the weighted mean was accepted as the KCRV, while at 2 m/s, a median from key comparison results was estimated as the KCRV. The final report presents the degree of equivalence between NMIs and the KCRV as well as the degree of equivalence between NMIs.</p>
