    <p>At the highest metrological level, natural gas standards are commonly prepared gravimetrically as PSMs (primary standard mixtures). This international key comparison is a repeat of CCQM-K1e-g. The mixtures concerned contain nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the alkanes up to butane. The only difference with CCQM-K1e-g is the addition of iso-butane to the list. The results usually agree within 1% (or better) with the key comparison reference value. For ethane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, the agreement is within 0.5% (or better), and for methane within 0.1% (or better) of the KCRV.</p><p>Main text.
