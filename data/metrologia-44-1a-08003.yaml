  content: "<p>In this second part of this study, primary standard gas mixtures (PSMs)
    as used for calibrations for the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane have
    been compared. The nominal amount-of-substance fraction levels were 365 µmol/mol
    for carbon dioxide and 1.8 µmol/mol for methane. The matrix was synthetic air,
    simulated by a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen (209 mmol/mol) and argon (9.3 mmol/mol).
    The measurements took place in the spring of 2003. In the protocol, it was foreseen
    to have the PSMs produced for this study in a small range, enabling regression
    analysis on the data to assess the consistency of the gas mixtures.</p>\n<p>The
    direct comparison of the PSMs shows agreement for carbon dioxide at 365 µmol/mol
    nominal within 0.52 µmol/mol (0.14% relative) standard uncertainty. One cylinder
    lies between the 95% and 99% boundaries of the regression line, and after removing
    this cylinder from the dataset the standard deviation of the  <italic>x</italic>-residuals
    reduces to 0.18 µmol/mol (0.05% relative). This value for the standard deviation
    is substantially greater than the stated standard uncertainties for several cylinders.
    The standard deviation of the  <italic>x</italic>-residuals for methane at 1.8
    µmol/mol nominal is 0.011 µmol/mol. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach
