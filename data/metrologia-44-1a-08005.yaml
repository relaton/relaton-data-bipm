    <p>This comparison is the first key comparison in the field of gas analysis organized by Technical Committee 1.8 'Physical Chemistry' COOMET. This comparison is the fourth key comparison on automobile gases. Earlier key comparisons on automobile gases were carried out by the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance  CCQM-K3 (the results were published on 21 November 2001) and by regional metrological organizations EUROMET and APMP (EUROMET.QM-K3—the results were published on 5 July 2002,  APMP.QM-K3—the results were published on 14 November 2003).</p><p>The relevance of the comparison is based on the tightening of requirements on the control of automobile emissions (putting EURO 4 and EURO-5 into operation). The foundation of this comparison is:<p>The formation of circumstances for recognition of the national measurement standards of Belarus and Ukraine, which earlier did not participate in key comparisons, and entering of the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMC) of BelGIM and Ukrmetrteststandard in the field of automobile gases to the international database KCDB in accordance with the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) for national measurement standards and for calibration and measurement certificates issued by NMIs;</p><p>The objective of NMIs which participated in key comparisons on automobile gases earlier (BAM and VNIIM) is to support or improve their calibration and measurement capabilities.</p></p><p>All laboratories find the gravimetric value within ±0.7% relative to the gravimetric value. This holds for all three components, CO, CO<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> in nitrogen. This is a satisfying result. For all laboratories the observed difference between the gravimetric and reported values does not exceed its combined uncertainty.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
