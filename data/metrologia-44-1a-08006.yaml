abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this comparison was to compare capabilities for the preparation
    and value assignment of gas mixture standards for benzene, chloroform, dichloromethane,
    trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,3-butadiene and
    vinyl chloride in nitrogen (HAPs-8), maintained at national metrology institutes
    (NMIs).  The measurements in this key comparison took place in 2003. There were
    six participants and one coordinating laboratory. The key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) was based on the gravimetric preparation for all components. The
    range of the nominal amount-of-substance fractions of the comparison standard
    is 90 nmol/mol to 110 nmol/mol. The Chemical Evaluation Research Institute (CERI,
    Japan) prepared gravimetric mixture samples of HAPs-8 in 10Â L aluminium cylinders
    and the homogeneity and long term stability of these samples were evaluated at
    CERI before and after the shipment of the cylinders to the participants. Each
    participating laboratory was shipped one cylinder to be analysed and then returned
    to the CERI. Each sample was reanalysed to verify whether the contents were stable
    throughout the comparison. These measurements showed no significant change in
    the amount fraction within the estimated uncertainty of the measurements except
    for 1,2-dichroloethane. These deviations were combined into the uncertainty of
    the comparison samples but were small enough compared to the deviations from values
    reported by participating laboratories and the gravimetric values of the samples.</p><p>
