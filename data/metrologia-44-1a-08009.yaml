    <p>The subsequent key comparison CCQM-K34.1 was organized as a subsequent comparison to  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/08008">CCQM-K34: Assay of potassium hydrogen phthalate</ext-link> to demonstrate the capability of BAM to measure the amount content of acid in potassium hydrogen phthalate. The BAM sample was contaminated in CCQM-K34 and therefore the result of BAM was not taken into account. Both key comparisons and the previous pilot study CCQM-P36 were organized jointly by the working groups of inorganic analysis and electrochemistry analysis. Both participants used high-accuracy constant current coulometry for measurement. The agreement of the results was very good. The Slovak Institute of Metrology acted as the coordinating laboratory and served as a link to the reference value of CCQM-K34.</p>
