abstract:
- content: "<p>CCQM-P48 was a Pilot Study of the \nInorganic Analysis Working Group
    of the Comité\nConsultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) and was organized
    by the Institute for\nReference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) of the European
    Commission. It was the first\nCCQM comparison dedicated to isotope ratio measurements.</p><p>It
    involved a rather rare combination of 5 national metrology institutes (NMIs),
    representing at the\nComité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) 3 Member
    States of the Metre Convention\nand 2 international organisations, and 10 invited
    laboratories (5 'nuclear experts', 5\n'geochemistry/mass spectrometry experts')
    selected outside CIPM. The aim was to compare\ncapabilities to measure the n(<sup>234</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U),
    n(<sup>235</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U) \nand n(<sup>236</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U)
    ratios in 4\nsimulated biological/environmental materials prepared at a nominal
    uranium mass fraction of\n5 µg g<sup>-1</sup> (series A) and, optionally, in 4
    simulated biological/environmental materials prepared\nat a nominal uranium mass
    fraction of 5 ng g<sup>-1</sup> (series B). In addition, a diluted solution of
    \nIRMM-184, a natural uranium isotopic certified reference material (ICRM), had
    also been distributed\nfor rehearsal as well as for calibration purposes. Participants,
    however, were free to apply the\nmeasurement strategy of their choice.</p><p>The
    test material can be assimilated to a biological/environmental type of sample
    as the\nmatrix simulated approximately the composition of urine, from the combination
    in ~ 3%\nHNO<sub>3</sub> solution of purified inorganic salt (aquarium seawater
    salts to 18 ± 2 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) and urea\n(to 17 ± 2 g kg<sup>-1</sup>). Four
    uranium isotopic mixtures were produced by mixing uranium ICRMs\nin the gas phase
    as UF<sub>6</sub>. Fractions of these mixtures, following their transformation
    under the\nform of solid UO<sub>3</sub>, were dissolved individually into ~ 3%
    HNO<sub>3</sub> to get separate ~ 1000 mg\nuranium kg<sup>-1</sup> mother solutions.
    Both series of test materials derived from these solutions\n(simple dilution into
    batches of simulated urine), but participants were not informed about this\nsimilitude.</p><p>The
    absolute value of the n(<sup>235</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U) ratio in each isotopic
    mixture was established at the\nearliest stage (i.e. in the gas phase) by calibrated
    gas source mass spectrometry measurements,\nand thus could serve as independent
    reference value (expanded, k = 2, uncertainty U = 0.05%,\nrelative) for results
    from series A. 'Mixture mode' (MM) median data based on participants'\nresults
    were proposed as consensus reference values for all the other sets of results
    produced.</p><p>For samples from series A, 6 laboratories implemented a combination
    of sample digestion and\nmatrix separation steps, whereas 3 laboratories did not
    report any particular sample treatment\n(apart possibly from dilution). Only mass
    spectrometry was employed for isotope ratio\nmeasurements, including 9 MC-ICPMS,
    3 HR-ICPMS, 2 TIMS and 1 ICP-QMS. For\n n(<sup>235</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U)
    ratios, results from 11 laboratories were in agreement within stated U with\nreference
    values for at least 3 mixtures; stated relative U were always &gt; 0.0120% (except
    for\n1 participant) and always ⩽ 0.7% (except for 1 participant with U &gt; 1%
    for 3 samples).\nResults on n(<sup>234</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U) ratios were
    almost always within ± 3% around the calculated MM\nmedian value. For the n(<sup>236</sup>U)/n(<sup>238</sup>U)
    smallest ratio, ~ 5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, results relative to the\ncalculated MM
    median value were within ± 20% for 8 participants, between 20% and 50%\nabove
    for 3 other participants, over 50% above for 1 participant, and 3 participants
    did not\nreport results. The perception of which factor caused the largest contribution
    to these\nuncertainty estimations differed among participants because of differences
    in the analytical\nmethodologies deployed but mostly because of wide differences
    in concepts of uncertainty\nestimation.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text
