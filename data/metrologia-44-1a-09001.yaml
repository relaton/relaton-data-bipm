    <p>A regional key comparison APMP.AUV.A-K1 has been carried out for the pressure sensitivity of laboratory standard microphones. The National
    Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) piloted this project. Two LS1P microphones were circulated through nine national metrology institutes and calibrated in the frequency range from 63 Hz to 8 kHz. Deviations from the mean value are below Â± 0.05 dB for all the frequencies. Results have been linked to CIPM key comparison CCAUV.A-K1 by introducing a correction factor. For every participant, the degree of equivalence with a key comparison reference value is within the corresponding expanded uncertainty.</p><p>Main text.
