    <p>A regional key comparison APMP.AUV.A-K1 has been carried out for the pressure sensitivity of laboratory standard microphones. The National
    Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) piloted this project. Two LS1P microphones were circulated through nine national metrology institutes and calibrated in the frequency range from 63 Hz to 8 kHz. Deviations from the mean value are below Â± 0.05 dB for all the frequencies. Results have been linked to CIPM key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/09002">CCAUV.A-K1</ext-link> by introducing a correction factor. For every participant, the degree of equivalence with a key comparison reference value is within the corresponding expanded uncertainty.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
