    <p>COOMET.AUV.A-K3 is a Regional Comparison that supplements the Key Comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/09001">CCAUV.A-K3</ext-link> organized by the CCAUV. The participating NMIs are GUM (Poland), INM (Romania), VNIIFTRI (Russia) and DP-NDI 'Systema' (Ukraine). The role of Pilot laboratory was undertaken by DPLA-DFM (Denmark). The measurements took place between May 2005 and February 2006. The time schedule was organized in a single star configuration. Initially, two LS2aP microphones were circulated. However, a sudden change of sensitivity of one of them forced the inclusion of an additional microphone. Nevertheless, the analysis was performed on all microphones involved. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of degrees of equivalence and the link to the CCAUV.A-K3.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
