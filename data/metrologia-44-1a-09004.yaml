    <p>The need for a comparison of laboratory standard microphones type LS2aP was agreed during the EUROMET TC AUV 'Sound in air' SC and contact persons meeting in Warsaw, held in May 2002. The goal of the comparison is to complement on a regional scale the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/09001/">CCAUV.A-K3</ext-link> comparison, in order to be able to demonstrate the equivalence of acoustical pressure standards of European NMIs.  The EUROMET TC AUV presented a project No 674 for the comparison and it was agreed that IEN would be the pilot laboratory with technical assistance given by DPLA. A Technical Protocol was distributed in September 2003 and measurements started in November 2003. Draft A was prepared in January 2005 and finally approved in May 2005 at the TC AUV EUROMET meeting in Torino. The CCAUV approved this final report and the degrees of equivalence in September 2006.</p>
