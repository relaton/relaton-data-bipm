- content: |-
    <p>The DPLA-DFM (Denmark) and the NPLI (India) have carried out a bilateral comparison as an extension of the CCAUV.A-K3 key comparison organized by the CCAUV. The DPLA-DFM undertook the role of the Pilot laboratory. The measurements took place immediately after the measurements of the CCAUV.A-K3 comparison. Two of the LS2aP microphones used in that comparison were used in the bilateral comparison before the results were announced. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of degrees of equivalence and the link to the CCAUV.A-K3.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
