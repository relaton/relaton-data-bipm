    <p>The DPLA-DFM (Denmark) and the NPLI (India) have carried out a bilateral comparison as an extension of the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/09001/">CCAUV.A-K3</ext-link> key comparison organized by the CCAUV. The DPLA-DFM undertook the role of the Pilot laboratory. The measurements took place immediately after the measurements of the CCAUV.A-K3 comparison. Two of the LS2aP microphones used in that comparison were used in the bilateral comparison before the results were announced. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of degrees of equivalence and the link to the CCAUV.A-K3.</p>
