abstract:
- content: "<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), published
    by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), recognizes Type B
    state-of-knowledge probability distributions specified by scientific judgment
    as valid means to quantify uncertainty. The ISO-GUM discusses symmetric probability
    distributions only. Sometimes an asymmetric distribution is needed. We describe
    a trapezoidal distribution which may be asymmetric depending on the settings of
    its parameters. We describe the probability density function, cumulative distribution
    function (cdf), inverse function of the cdf, moment generating function, moments
    about origin (zero), expected value and variance of a trapezoidal distribution.
    We show that triangular and rectangular distributions are special cases of the
    trapezoidal distribution. Then we derive the moment generating functions, moments,
    expected values and variances of various special cases of the trapezoidal distribution.
    Finally, we illustrate through a real life example how a Type B asymmetric trapezoidal
    distribution may be useful in quantifying a correction for bias (systematic error)
    in a result of measurement and in quantifying the standard uncertainty associated
    with the correction.</p>"
