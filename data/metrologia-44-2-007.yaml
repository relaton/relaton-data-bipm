abstract:
- content: "<p>The amount of reversible water vapour adsorption on surfaces was measured
    by comparison weighings using samples with a surface area difference of more than
    795 cm<sup>2</sup>. Stainless steel surfaces, single crystal silicon surfaces
    and sputter-deposited surfaces were chosen as the samples. The sputter-deposited
    films with a thickness of 25 nm to 28 nm showed characteristics that suggested
    they were densely packed. It was found that these sputter-deposited films could
    reduce the monolayer capacity,  n<sub>m</sub>, of the stainless steel surface
    (0.0238 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>) by 35%.</p>"
