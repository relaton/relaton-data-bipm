abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper considers the estimation of a quantity from a set of repeated
    measurements {x<sub>i</sub>} by the value of t minimizing ∑<sub>i</sub> |x<sub>i</sub>
    − t|<sup>p</sup>, as in Pennecchi and Callegaro (2006 Metrologia 43 213–19). The
    estimate with p = 2 is the familiar sample mean. Assumptions that are relevant
    when preferring an estimate with p &lt; 2 are identified and examined. Theoretical
    considerations and results of simulations weaken the case for choosing an estimate
    with p &lt; 2. The simulation results support the regular use of the sample mean
    or an estimate that involves the value p = 1.5 when the kurtosis of the dataset
    is sufficiently large.</p>"
