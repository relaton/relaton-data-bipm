abstract:
- content: "<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) applies
    to the generic situation that a model is available which relates the quantity
    of interest to input quantities and that information on the input quantities is
    given in terms of estimates and uncertainties. Within this framework, the GUM
    specifies how to calculate an estimate of the quantity of interest and the uncertainty
    associated with this estimate as well as a coverage interval for the quantity
    according to a stipulated coverage probability.</p><p>In this paper the case is
    considered that additional prior knowledge about the quantity of interest is available.
    For instance, the quantity of interest could be known to be positive or some prior
    estimate and its associated uncertainty may be given. This case is treated using
    probability density functions which encode the information on the input quantities
    as well as the prior knowledge about the quantity of interest. In general, numerical
    techniques have to be employed and an easy-to-apply Monte Carlo method is proposed.</p><p>For
    the particular case of a linear (or linearized) model relation and Gaussian probability
    density functions an analytic solution is derived and discussed. Finally, the
    proposed treatment, its numerical implementation and the possible benefit of taking
    into account prior knowledge are illustrated by an example.</p>"
