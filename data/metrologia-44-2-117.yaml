  content: "<p>The <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>
    (GUM), published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
    recognizes Type B state-of-knowledge probability distributions specified by scientific
    judgment as valid means to quantify uncertainty. The ISO-GUM discusses symmetric
    probability distributions only. Sometimes an asymmetric distribution is needed.
    We describe a trapezoidal distribution which may be asymmetric depending on the
    settings of its parameters. We describe the probability density function, cumulative
    distribution function (cdf), inverse function of the cdf, moment generating function,
    moments about origin (zero), expected value and variance of a trapezoidal distribution.
    We show that triangular and rectangular distributions are special cases of the
    trapezoidal distribution. Then we derive the moment generating functions, moments,
    expected values and variances of various special cases of the trapezoidal distribution.
    Finally, we illustrate through a real life example how a Type B asymmetric trapezoidal
    distribution may be useful in quantifying a correction for bias (systematic error)
    in a result of measurement and in quantifying the standard uncertainty associated
    with the correction.</p>"
