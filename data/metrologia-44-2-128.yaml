  content: "<p>The ‘uncertainty matrix’, i.e. the variance/covariance matrix associated
    with a set of values obtained by measurement of multiple measurands, is discussed
    as the multivariate analogue of the standard uncertainty (or rather the variance)
    of a value obtained for a single measurand. The main topics are the characterization
    and comparison of uncertainty matrices with respect to the level of uncertainty
    of derived quantities and the level of correlation effects on the uncertainty
    of derived quantities. Examples include a comprehensive application study on the
    normalization of natural gas composition data. Supplementary technical material
    such as basic properties of uncertainty matrices and mathematical proofs are included
    in an appendix.</p>"
