abstract:
- content: "<p>We report an absolute frequency measurement of the optical clock transition
    at 657 nm in<sup>40</sup>Ca with a relative uncertainty of 7.5 × 10<sup>−15</sup>,
    one of the most accurate frequency measurements of a neutral atom optical transition
    to date. The frequency (455 986 240 494 135.8 ± 3.4) Hz was measured by stabilizing
    a diode laser system to a spectroscopic signal derived from an ensemble of 10<sup>6</sup>
    atoms cooled in two stages to a temperature of 10 µK. The measurement used a femtosecond-laser-based
    frequency comb to compare the Ca transition frequency with that of the single-ion<sup>199</sup>Hg<sup>+</sup>
    optical frequency standard at NIST. The Hg<sup>+</sup> frequency was simultaneously
    calibrated relative to the NIST Cs fountain via the NIST time scale to yield an
    absolute value for the Ca transition frequency. The relative fractional instability
    between the two optical standards was 2 × 10<sup>−15</sup> for 10 s of averaging
    time and 2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for 2000 s.</p>"
