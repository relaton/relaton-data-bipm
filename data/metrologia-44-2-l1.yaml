  content: "<p>Metal窶田arbon eutectic fixed points are revolutionizing high temperature
    metrology. However, the quality of the melting curve relies heavily on achieving
    good axial temperature uniformity along the fixed point crucible. This is not
    easy to achieve with conventional tube furnaces, and much work has been published
    in which temperature uniformity is clearly a problem. Here is presented a simple,
    inexpensive and effective way of reducing temperature gradients along the fixed
    point crucible by at least a factor of two. This leads to a corresponding increase
    in melt duration and quality. A key feature of the device, essential to its operation,
    is the fact that it mechanically isolates the fixed point crucible from its surroundings.</p>"
