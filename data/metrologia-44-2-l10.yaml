abstract:
- content: "<p>The eutectoid transition in the iron–carbon system around 730 °C has
    been tested as a potential fixed point for use in thermocouple thermometry. Using
    a heating rate ≤ 1.5 °C min<sup>−1</sup>, the α–γ transition showed a short, but
    repeatable, plateau with a repeatability of 0.07 °C. However, the γ–α transition
    only exhibited a small discontinuity in a plot of emf versus time. Although only
    preliminary results were obtained here, once the thermodynamic (or the ITS-90)
    temperature, as well as its uncertainty, is assigned to this eutectoid transition,
    then the hypereutectoid transition in the iron–carbon system is potentially very
    useful, in that this fixed point can be obtained additionally while realizing
    the iron–carbon eutectic point.</p>"
