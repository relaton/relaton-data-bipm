abstract:
- content: "<p>The Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) requires the calculation of
    unilateral degrees of equivalence (DoE), defined as the difference between a laboratory's
    measurement and a key comparison reference value (KCRV). The functional form of
    the KCRV has been a source of much debate, with most of the proposed solutions
    being based on a frequentist interpretation of probability. The focus of this
    article is on the case when the result of each laboratory's measurement is interpreted
    as a mean and standard deviation of a probability distribution of belief about
    a measurand. Bayesian statistical methods are best suited to deal with this situation
    and lead to interesting insights about the form of the KCRV and the DoE.</p>"
