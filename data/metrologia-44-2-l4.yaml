  content: "<p>Redefinitions of the kilogram based on either the electron mass, the
    carbon-12 atomic mass or a pseudo-mass proportional to the Planck constant are
    examined, together with respective resulting uncertainties in a number of important
    constants. The kilogram-to-dalton mass ratio is shown to play a central role in
    coupling mass unit definitions with those of units for amount of substance, since
    the kg/Da mass ratio is equal to the kilomole-to-entity amount-of-substance ratio
    in a compatible formulation. Because of this coupling, a redefinition of the unit
    for amount of substance using a fixed exact value of the kmol/ent ratio implies
    an exact value of the dalton in terms of the kilogram (regardless of how the kilogram
    itself is defined), thereby eliminating any need for a ‘correction factor’ in
    expressions involving amount-specific mass. In particular, compatible definitions
    guarantee that <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> Da = Da ent<sup>−1</sup> = kg kmol<sup>−1</sup>
    = g mol<sup>−1</sup>, exactly.</p>"
