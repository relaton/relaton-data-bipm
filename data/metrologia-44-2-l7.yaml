  content: "<p>Parametric estimation of coverage interval is useful since the parametric
    intervals are generally narrower than the non-parametric ones; however, it has
    been considered only for the measurement variable with normal distribution. Here
    we propose a general technique for constructing parametric coverage intervals
    that may deal with all distributions, both symmetric and asymmetric, in measurement
    science.</p>"
