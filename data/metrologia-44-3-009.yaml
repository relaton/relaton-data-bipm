abstract:
- content: "<p>The present paper describes the effect of different pressure-transmitting
    fluids (PTFs) on the systematic characterization of an oil-operated controlled
    clearance piston gauge (nominal diameter of the piston, 2.5 mm) in the pressure
    range up to 1000 MPa (1 GPa). Pure PTFs and mixtures of different PTFs are studied
    and four of them will be discussed here: namely (a) pure normal hydraulic oil
    (J-13), (b) a mixture of J-13 and an aviation turbine fuel (ATF), (JATF), (c)
    a pure di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacate oil (BIS) and (d) a mixture of white gasoline (G),
    J-13 and sebacate (GJBIS).</p><p>The characterization is the measurement of the
    fall-rate of the piston as a function of applied jacket pressure (p<sub>j</sub>)
    with various PTFs using the method of Heydemann and Welch (HW model) (Heydemann
    and Welch 1975 Experimental Thermodynamics vol II, ed B Leneindre and B Voder
    (London: Butterworths) p 147). The analysis of the results is the determination
    of the cube root of the piston fall-rate (v<sup>1/3</sup>) with p<sub>j</sub>
    at different loads or measured pressures (p<sub>m</sub>). The linear portion of
    this v<sup>1/3</sup>–p<sub>j</sub> curve is extrapolated towards the null value
    of fall-rate, and the stall jacket pressure (p<sub>z</sub>) at different p<sub>m</sub>
    is obtained. It is observed that reasonably good fall-rate data could be obtained
    for J-13, JATF and BIS up to maximum pressures of 500 MPa, 700 MPa and 650 MPa,
    respectively. For GJBIS, these fall-rate data can be obtained up to a maximum
    pressure of 1 GPa. From the values of p<sub>z</sub> at different p<sub>m</sub>
    and also the values of the jacket pressure coefficient (d) along with other characteristic
    parameters in the HW model (Newhall et al 1979 Rev. Sci. Instrum. 50 964–8, Bandyopadhyay
    and Olson 2006 Metrologia 43 573–82), we have determined the relative standard
    uncertainties in the effective area (u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub>) for GJBIS
    up to 1 GPa for p<sub>j</sub> = 0 (free deformation mode) and p<sub>j</sub>/p<sub>m</sub>
    = 0.3. It is interesting to note that for p<sub>j</sub> = 0, at a p<sub>m</sub>
    of 100 MPa, u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub> is 74 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, while at a
    p<sub>m</sub> of 1 GPa, u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub> is 248 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.
    However, for p<sub>j</sub>/p<sub>m</sub> = 0.3, at a p<sub>m</sub> of 100 MPa,
    u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub> is 67 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, while at a p<sub>m</sub>
    of 1 GPa, u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub> is 125 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. A comparative
    study of u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub> has been elaborated with the four PTFs
    investigated. We have shown that at a p<sub>m</sub> of 100 MPa, u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub>
    is 202 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, 114 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, 66 × 10<sup>−6</sup> and 67 ×
    10<sup>−6</sup>, for J-13, JATF, BIS and GJBIS, respectively, while at a p<sub>m</sub>
    of 500 MPa, u(A<sub>e</sub>)/A<sub>e</sub> is seen to be 97 × 10<sup>−6</sup>,
    57 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, 46 × 10<sup>−6</sup> and 56 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for J13, JATF,
    BIS and GJBIS, respectively. Our measurements show that GJBIS is a convenient
    PTF for working up to 1 GPa. Finally, the results of the characterization are
    compared with the NPLI pressure scale through calibration of a NPLI secondary
    standard which is traceable to the LNE (France) pressure scale though direct comparison
    and participation in a recently concluded bilateral comparison with NIST (USA).</p>"
