abstract:
- content: "<p>The significance of light scattering around the main beam in a gonioreflectometer
    based measurement of spectral diffuse reflectance is discussed. This kind of scatter
    is always present in goniometric measurement systems that use a shaped measurement
    beam. Furthermore, errors due to this effect are a potential cause of discrepancies
    between goniometer and integrating-sphere based measurement methods. Procedures
    used to determine such errors and the required corrections are presented. At the
    Helsinki University of Technology, the determined wavelength-dependent correction
    in the worst case was as high as −1.6% and could be reduced to −0.2% with improvements
    in the optical setup of the gonioreflectometer. The measurement results for our
    diffuse reflectance reference materials with the appropriate corrections in each
    case are in good agreement, which gives a new view on some measurements reported
    earlier.</p>"
