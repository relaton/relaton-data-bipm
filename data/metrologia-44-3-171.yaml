  content: <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed
    a new transfer standard capable of absolute-mode and differential-mode operation
    in the range 100 Pa to 130 kPa. This newly built transfer standard relies on resonant
    silicon gauges (RSGs) of the same type used to provide superior long-term calibration
    stability in NIST piloted international key comparisons CCM.P-K4 and CCM.P-K5,
    which covered absolute and differential pressure standards pressures up to 1 kPa

    and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/39/1A/18">07002</ext-link>).
    The new transfer standard package differs from the previous packages in that it
    fully covers the atmospheric pressure range (100 Pa to 130 kPa). This was made
    possible by the addition of a pair of 130 kPa RSGs to complement a pair of 10 kPa
    RSGs. The RSG transfer standard package has demonstrated good short-term zero
    stability and pressure resolution, and has demonstrated long-term instability
    of only a few ppm at 130 kPa, increasing to 0.01% at 100 Pa. The long-term instability
    is nominally commensurate with that associated with piston gauge standards, which
    are limited to pressures of nominally 10 kPa and higher. The main advantage of
    the new package is that it operates easily at lower pressures than piston gauges
    while still covering the atmospheric pressure range 100 Pa to 130 kPa.</p>
