abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper analyses the problems that appear when calibration or verification
    of personal sound exposure meters is done following the recommendations of IEC
    61252. The tests recommended in the standard to verify the characteristics of
    such instruments are discussed and alternative procedures are proposed to solve
    the problems detected. The two main problems detected are related to the duration
    of the process, which has a direct effect on the verification cost, and the measurement
    uncertainty. The use of procedures based on measurement modes that are not dependent
    on integration times, such as when measuring sound pressure level, is recommended
    whenever possible.</p>"
