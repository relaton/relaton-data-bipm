  content: "<p>Typically an estimate \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    of an unknown response curve <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>) is obtained
    with an associated function \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    describing the standard uncertainty of the estimate at each value of <italic>x</italic>.
    Often the quantity of interest will be a functional of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>),
    such as a derivative or integral. In such a case the standard uncertainty cannot
    be calculated without knowledge of the correlation between \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in003.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    and \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in004.gif\"></inline-graphic> for
    all relevant pairs of points (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>,
    <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>). This information might be stored
    as a two-dimensional function \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in005.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    in the continuous case or as a matrix (<italic>u</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub>)
    in the discrete case, but this will often be impractical. The difficulty can often
    be avoided by instead storing the ‘random’ and ‘systematic’ components of uncertainty,
    which is a concept that is familiar but out of favour. This step enables the calculation
    of standard uncertainty for many functionals of <italic>f</italic>(<italic>x</italic>)
    from numerical data and from a graphical representation. Three examples are given
    illustrating these concepts. The paper also discusses the issue of expressing
    the uncertainty associated with \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    as a whole; that is, the simultaneous estimation of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro247551in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    at every value of <italic>x</italic>.</p>"
