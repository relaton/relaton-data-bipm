abstract:
- content: "<p>Typically an estimate \n of an unknown response curve f(x) is obtained
    with an associated function \n describing the standard uncertainty of the estimate
    at each value of x. Often the quantity of interest will be a functional of f(x),
    such as a derivative or integral. In such a case the standard uncertainty cannot
    be calculated without knowledge of the correlation between \n and \n for all relevant
    pairs of points (x<sub>i</sub>, x<sub>j</sub>). This information might be stored
    as a two-dimensional function \n in the continuous case or as a matrix (u<sub>ij</sub>)
    in the discrete case, but this will often be impractical. The difficulty can often
    be avoided by instead storing the ‘random’ and ‘systematic’ components of uncertainty,
    which is a concept that is familiar but out of favour. This step enables the calculation
    of standard uncertainty for many functionals of f(x) from numerical data and from
    a graphical representation. Three examples are given illustrating these concepts.
    The paper also discusses the issue of expressing the uncertainty associated with
    \n as a whole; that is, the simultaneous estimation of \n at every value of x.</p>"
