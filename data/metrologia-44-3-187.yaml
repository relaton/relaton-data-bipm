abstract:
- content: "<p>Suppose a single stable travelling standard is circulated around the
    national metrology institutes (NMIs) participating in a key comparison. Consider
    the set of data consisting of a measurement result, comprising a measured value
    and the associated standard uncertainty, provided independently by each such NMI.
    Each measured value is the corresponding NMI's best estimate of a single stipulated
    property of the standard. The weighted mean (WM) of the measured values can be
    formed, the weights being proportional to the reciprocals of the squared standard
    uncertainties. If this WM is consistent with the measured values according to
    a statistical test, it can be accepted as a key comparison reference value for
    the comparison. Otherwise, the WM of a largest consistent subset (LCS) can be
    determined. The LCS contains as many as possible of those results of participating
    NMIs that are consistent with the WM of that subset. An efficient approach for
    determining the LCS having smallest chi-squared value is described, and applied
    to length, temperature and ionizing radiation comparisons.</p>"
