  content: "<p>The standard deviation of the mean is the most common basis for specifying
    the statistical uncertainty of repeated measurements, yet it is often calculated
    incorrectly. The variance of the mean, \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    of a time series of correlated measurements of a weakly stationary process is
    correctly expressed in terms of the autocorrelation function (ACF) at lag <italic>k</italic>,
    ρ(<italic>k</italic>). This approach is used to evaluate \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    for white voltage noise measured at regular time intervals τ<sub>0</sub> through
    a low pass filter of bandwidth <italic>B</italic> by four methods: (1) by developing
    the expression ρ(<italic>k</italic>) = exp (−4<italic>B</italic>τ<sub>0</sub><italic>k</italic>)
    evaluated by estimating <italic>B</italic> from the sample spectrum; (2) by noting
    that ρ(<italic>k</italic>) = ϕ<sup><italic>k</italic></sup>, ϕ = exp(−4<italic>B</italic>τ<sub>0</sub>)
    &lt; 1 is the ACF of a first-order autoregressive process, AR(1), for which \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro248396in001.gif\"></inline-graphic> is readily evaluated in
    terms of ϕ; (3) by estimating \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    from the sample ACF, \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    using the cut-off lag for an AR(1) process; and (4) by applying the general method
    recently proposed by Zhang (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/43/4/S15\">2006
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>43</bold> S276–81</ext-link>), to estimate \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro248396in001.gif\"></inline-graphic> from \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    assuming that the data may be described by a moving average process with a cut-off
    lag deduced from the \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    themselves. The values of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro248396in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    from the four methods are in good agreement. This provides firm support to Zhang's
    method; this is important because of this method's wide scope of application.</p>"
