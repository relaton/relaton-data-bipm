abstract:
- content: "<p>The standard deviation of the mean is the most common basis for specifying
    the statistical uncertainty of repeated measurements, yet it is often calculated
    incorrectly. The variance of the mean,, of a time series of correlated measurements
    of a weakly stationary process is correctly expressed in terms of the autocorrelation
    function (ACF) at lag k, ρ(k). This approach is used to evaluate \n for white
    voltage noise measured at regular time intervals τ<sub>0</sub> through a low pass
    filter of bandwidth B by four methods: (1) by developing the expression ρ(k) =
    exp (−4Bτ<sub>0</sub>k) evaluated by estimating B from the sample spectrum; (2)
    by noting that ρ(k) = ϕ<sup>k</sup>, ϕ = exp(−4Bτ<sub>0</sub>) &lt; 1 is the ACF
    of a first-order autoregressive process, AR(1), for which \n is readily evaluated
    in terms of ϕ; (3) by estimating \n from the sample ACF,, using the cut-off lag
    for an AR(1) process; and (4) by applying the general method recently proposed
    by Zhang (2006 Metrologia 43 S276–81), to estimate \n from, assuming that the
    data may be described by a moving average process with a cut-off lag deduced from
    the \n themselves. The values of \n from the four methods are in good agreement.
    This provides firm support to Zhang's method; this is important because of this
    method's wide scope of application.</p>"
