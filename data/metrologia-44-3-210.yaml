abstract:
- content: "<p>NPL has chosen to use the laser pistonphone as the basis for some of
    its measurements for international key comparison CCAUV.A-K2. The other laboratories
    taking part in the key comparison have all used the reciprocity technique for
    their low-frequency measurements, thus the use of a laser pistonphone allows the
    verification (or otherwise) of this technique at low frequencies. Since the use
    of this device for the calibration of microphones is not currently included in
    international standards, this paper describes this calibration method and gives
    a full account of the associated measurement uncertainty. While the NPL laser
    pistonphone has existed since the 1970s, its true value to the international community
    is only now being revealed.</p><p>This paper also provides the necessary background
    information to support the key comparison data when they are eventually published.</p>"
