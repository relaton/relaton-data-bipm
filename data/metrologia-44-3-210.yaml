    <p>NPL has chosen to use the laser pistonphone as the basis for some of its measurements for international key comparison CCAUV.A-K2. The other laboratories taking part in the key comparison have all used the reciprocity technique for their low-frequency measurements, thus the use of a laser pistonphone allows the verification (or otherwise) of this technique at low frequencies. Since the use of this device for the calibration of microphones is not currently included in international standards, this paper describes this calibration method and gives a full account of the associated measurement uncertainty. While the NPL laser pistonphone has existed since the 1970s, its true value to the international community is only now being revealed.</p>
    <p>This paper also provides the necessary background information to support the key comparison data when they are eventually published.</p>
