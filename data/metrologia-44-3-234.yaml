abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>In absolute gravimeters, rotation of the falling body causes a systematic
    error. This error can be minimized by coinciding the centre of mass (COM) of the
    body with its optical centre (OC). A method to measure the distance between these
    centres in 3D space is described. The method is based on a mechanical balancing
    technique. Using this method, the COM of a hollow corner cube mirror assembly
    is adjusted to the OC to within (43 ± 16) µm. An uncertainty budget is given.</p>"
