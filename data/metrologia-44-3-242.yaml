abstract:
- content: "<p>Determining the true angle of detection of emitted electrons is a major
    factor for the accurate determination of film thicknesses in the range below 10 nm
    by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. To do this, the orientation of the surface
    normal in the instrument first requires determination. A comparison is made of
    two recent methods for the definition of the surface normal in x-ray photoelectron
    spectrometers. The first method, which we call the crystal axis method, involves
    the measurement of the Si 2p oxide and substrate intensities in the range ±5°
    around the surface normal for a (1 0 0) Si wafer with approximately 1 nm of thermal
    oxide. The second method, which we call the overlayer thickness consistency method,
    involves measuring similar intensities at 10°, 20°, 30° and 40° from the surface
    normal, for an amorphous oxide on amorphous Si sample, with a view to obtaining
    a consistent thickness. It is shown that both can readily define the surface normal
    alignment better than 1° but that the crystal axis method, for similar data quality
    and numbers of spectra, generates uncertainties a factor of approximately three
    times better than that of the overlayer consistency method and has fewer bias
    contributions. Possible improvements in the method are shown to be best by recording
    more data in the crystal axis method rather than, for example, by changing the
    materials.</p>"
