abstract:
- content: "<p>This is a contribution to the growing international discussion on the
    redefinition of SI units that is based on the proposal to define the mass of a
    particle in an absolute manner, requiring no choice of any mass standard, as the
    magnitude of the particle's de Broglie angular frequency when it is free and viewed
    from its rest frameâ€”a quantity which can readily be shown to possess the physical
    property of inertia. Such a definition implies that all the dynamical equations
    of classical or quantum physics can be written in terms of just two fundamental
    units, those of time and of length.</p>"
