  content: "<p>Computational models allow calculation of the value of an <italic>output
    quantity</italic> from a set of linked <italic>input quantities</italic>. The
    value of the output quantity yielded by a model is evidently influenced by errors
    in the determination of the input quantities. Therefore, the uncertainties of
    the output data can be expressed in terms of the uncertainties of the input quantities
    by using a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty propagation technique. As an example,
    we evaluated the uncertainty of the spectral UV irradiance rendered by a radiative
    transfer model under cloudless sky conditions. This model allows calculation of
    the spectrally resolved solar UV irradiance from some set of measured input quantities
    linked with the concentration of atmospheric constituents, the surface reflectivity
    as well as the spectral characteristics of the aerosol modulation. Although only
    a single model was used in this work, the methodology applied to evaluate the
    uncertainty is general and can be applied to any other computational model.</p>"
