  content: "<p>The relation between uncertainty evaluation according to the recent
    draft of GUM Supplement 1 and the application of Bayesian statistics including
    Bayes' theorem is considered. In the case of a Type A evaluation of uncertainty,
    repeated measurement indications are regarded as independently drawn from normal
    frequency distributions and, according to its suggestion, the numerical evaluation
    method of Supplement 1 is applied <italic>after</italic> having assigned scaled
    and shifted <italic>t</italic>-distributions to the corresponding input quantities.
    It will be shown that this approach is equivalent to a Bayesian analysis using
    Bayes' theorem with commonly used prior distributions.</p>"
