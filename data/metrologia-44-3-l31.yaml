abstract:
- content: "<p>The relation between uncertainty evaluation according to the recent
    draft of GUM Supplement 1 and the application of Bayesian statistics including
    Bayes' theorem is considered. In the case of a Type A evaluation of uncertainty,
    repeated measurement indications are regarded as independently drawn from normal
    frequency distributions and, according to its suggestion, the numerical evaluation
    method of Supplement 1 is applied after having assigned scaled and shifted t-distributions
    to the corresponding input quantities. It will be shown that this approach is
    equivalent to a Bayesian analysis using Bayes' theorem with commonly used prior
    distributions.</p>"
