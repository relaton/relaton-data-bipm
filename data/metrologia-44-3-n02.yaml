abstract:
- content: "<p>Computational models allow calculation of the value of an output quantity
    from a set of linked input quantities. The value of the output quantity yielded
    by a model is evidently influenced by errors in the determination of the input
    quantities. Therefore, the uncertainties of the output data can be expressed in
    terms of the uncertainties of the input quantities by using a Monte Carlo-based
    uncertainty propagation technique. As an example, we evaluated the uncertainty
    of the spectral UV irradiance rendered by a radiative transfer model under cloudless
    sky conditions. This model allows calculation of the spectrally resolved solar
    UV irradiance from some set of measured input quantities linked with the concentration
    of atmospheric constituents, the surface reflectivity as well as the spectral
    characteristics of the aerosol modulation. Although only a single model was used
    in this work, the methodology applied to evaluate the uncertainty is general and
    can be applied to any other computational model.</p>"
