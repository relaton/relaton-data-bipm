abstract:
- content: "<p>We discuss an apparent paradox in which the uncertainty of an estimate
    obtained in a data-based minimization problem with a unique solution seems to
    depend on the method of minimization. The paradox is explained by showing that
    the sensitivity coefficients appearing in the law of propagation of uncertainty
    cannot be calculated by explicitly following the iterative process. A simple experimental
    evaluation of the sensitivity coefficients seems preferable.</p>"
