abstract:
- content: "<p>The adoption of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement by the CIPM in 1999
    had an almost immediate affect on the approach national measurement laboratories
    took in the measurement of radioactivity and how their abilities in radionuclide
    metrology were relayed to customers and stakeholders. In order to meet the need
    presented by the CIPM MRA for validated claims to calibration and measurement
    capabilities, radionuclide measurement laboratories have taken an accelerated
    track to international comparisons and expanding quality systems, leading to a
    more rigorous approach to radionuclide metrology.</p>"
