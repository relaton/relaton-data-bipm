abstract:
- content: "<p>Accurate, reproducible measurement of radioactivity in nuclear medicine
    applications is vital to ensure the safety and effectiveness of disease diagnosis
    and treatment using unsealed radioactive sources. The need to maintain a high
    degree of confidence in those measurements requires that they be carried out so
    as to be traceable to national and international standards. In addition, measurement
    traceability for radioactivity in medicine helps ensure international consistency
    in measurement at all levels of practice (national measurement laboratories, research
    institutions, isotope producers, radiopharmaceutical manufacturers and clinics).
    This paper explores the importance of radioactivity measurement in nuclear medicine
    and demonstrates how traceability can be extended from international standards
    to the quantity of the drug administered to the patient.</p>"
