abstract:
- content: <p>Measurement traceability is an important component for the realization
    of the becquerel. For radioanalytical measurements, the definition of measurement
    traceability must include sub-sample processing operations prior to instrument
    measurement. The most effective demonstration that measurement traceability and
    the SI becquerel have been realized is<list list-type="unordered"><list-item><p>participation
    in suitable proficiency testing using appropriate traceable reference materials,</p></list-item><list-item><p>an
    embedded system of analytical quality control and</p></list-item><list-item><p>audit
    regimes covering all aspects of laboratory operation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Guidance
    documents are available for a number of measurement fields such as environmental
    and bioassay measurement that recognize the important utility of measurement tractability
    as part of the supporting metrology infrastructure. Non-radiometric methods, mainly
    mass spectrometry based, as well as field (or in situ) measurements are also available
    for the assay of radioactive species. These are not explicitly treated in this
    paper but should be consistent with the approaches described here.</p>
