    <p>Measurement traceability is an important component for the realization of the becquerel. For radioanalytical measurements, the definition of measurement traceability must include sub-sample processing operations prior to instrument measurement. The most effective demonstration that measurement traceability and the SI becquerel have been realized is
    <list list-type="unordered">
    <list-item><p>participation in suitable proficiency testing using appropriate traceable reference materials,</p></list-item>
    <list-item><p>an embedded system of analytical quality control and</p></list-item>
    <list-item><p>audit regimes covering all aspects of laboratory operation.</p></list-item>
    </list></p>
    <p>Guidance documents are available for a number of measurement fields such as environmental and bioassay measurement that recognize the important utility of measurement tractability as part of the supporting metrology infrastructure. Non-radiometric methods, mainly mass spectrometry based, as well as field (or <italic>in situ</italic>) measurements are also available for the assay of radioactive species. These are not explicitly treated in this paper but should be consistent with the approaches described here.</p>
