abstract:
- content: "<p>Site decommissioning is now a major aspect of the work of the nuclear
    industry worldwide. One of its many technical challenges is the need to measure
    levels of radioactivity in a range of materials (e.g. concrete, brick and steel)
    in order that radioactive waste may be identified, sentenced and consigned to
    the appropriate waste stream in accordance with national regulations. This is
    done using any of a number of measurement techniques, falling under three categories:
    (i) bulk monitoring (for γ and neutron emitters), (ii) surface monitoring (predominantly
    for α and β emitters) and (iii) radiochemical analysis. The last is often used
    to determine a ‘radionuclide fingerprint’ for a particular operational area for
    use in conjunction with data from in situ monitoring. Traceability to national
    standards can be difficult to demonstrate for measurements of this type. Only
    a limited number of standards and reference materials are available, and their
    chemical and physical forms do not match those of the very wide range of samples
    being measured. Traceability for surface measurements is further complicated by
    the subjective nature of monitoring using hand-held detectors.</p><p>This paper
    describes some of the detector types used for γ non-destructive assay (NDA) and
    for surface measurements, gives examples of currently available standards and
    calibration procedures and provides some guidance in how to achieve traceability.
    A generic analysis regime for an operational area is presented which demonstrates
    points where traceability can, in principle, be attained. A new methodology for
    developing ‘realistic’ large-volume standard sources, traceable to national standards,
    has been developed by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), and this is described.</p>"
