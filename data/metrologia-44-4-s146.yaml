abstract:
- content: "<p>Radiation protection instruments are used in daily measurement of dose
    and activities in workplaces and environments for safety management. The requirements
    for calibration certificates with traceability are increasing for these instruments
    to ensure the consistency and reliabilities of the measurement results. The present
    traceability scheme of radiation protection instruments for dose and activity
    measurements is described with related IEC/ISO requirements. Some examples of
    desirable future calibration systems with recent new technologies are also discussed
    to establish the traceability with reasonable costs and reliabilities.</p>"
