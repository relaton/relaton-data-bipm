  content: "<p>A succinct overview is presented of primary standardization methods
    for activity. They have been subdivided into high-geometry (4π or 2π) methods,
    defined-solid-angle counting methods and coincidence counting methods. References
    are provided of work explaining the basics of the methods as well as papers describing
    recent developments and applications.</p>"
