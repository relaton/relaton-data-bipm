abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurement traceability is an important component for the realization
    of the becquerel. For radioanalytical measurements, the definition of measurement
    traceability must include sub-sample processing operations prior to instrument
    measurement. The most effective demonstration that measurement traceability and
    the SI becquerel have been realized is<p>participation in suitable proficiency
    testing using appropriate traceable reference materials,</p><p>an embedded system
    of analytical quality control and</p><p>audit regimes covering all aspects of
    laboratory operation.</p></p><p>Guidance documents are available for a number
    of measurement fields such as environmental and bioassay measurement that recognize
    the important utility of measurement tractability as part of the supporting metrology
    infrastructure. Non-radiometric methods, mainly mass spectrometry based, as well
    as field (or  in situ ) measurements are also available for the assay of radioactive
    species. These are not explicitly treated in this paper but should be consistent
    with the approaches described here.</p>"
