  content: "<p>Widely implemented at national metrology institutes (NMIs), the coincidence
    method is a technique to assay a wide variety of radionuclides which decay through
    two or more types of radiation. Through a survey of the literature, this paper
    seeks to describe the main aspects of one of the most powerful direct methods
    available in radionuclide metrology. The basics of coincidence counting and the
    efficiency extrapolation method are covered. The problem of non-linearities in
    the extrapolation curve is also considered. The main characteristics of variants
    to the conventional coincidence instrumentation are presented.</p>"
