  content: "<p>The 4πβ–γ coincidence method for the absolute determination of nuclear
    disintegration rates has for decades been successfully applied to a variety of
    radionuclides, via the use of suites of dedicated analogue electronic modules.
    The high cost of procurement and maintenance of such systems, as well as the requirement
    for highly experienced technicians to perform the data collection have prompted
    the design of more flexible data collection techniques. Recent advances in digital
    signal acquisition technology have facilitated the possibility of storing pulse
    information from multiple detector systems along with a time stamp for each recorded
    event, allowing various radionuclide standardization techniques (based on the
    concept of 4πβ–γ coincidence counting) to be implemented ‘offline’ via the use
    of dedicated software routines. This brief paper reviews the progress in the development
    of such ‘digital coincidence counting’ systems used in the field of radionuclide
    metrology and may be viewed as a companion article to other papers (in this issue)
    on primary methods for radionuclide standardization.</p>"
