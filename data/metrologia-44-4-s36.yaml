abstract:
- content: "<p>Liquid scintillation counting (LSC) techniques can be used for radionuclide
    standardization when the calculation of detection efficiency is possible. This
    is done using a model of the physicochemical processes involved in light emission
    and also of the statistics of photon emission: the free parameter model. This
    model can then be applied in two ways: by deducing the free parameter from the
    measurement of a tracer (the CIEMAT/NIST method) or by calculating this free parameter
    from coincidence ratio in a specific LS counter (the TDCR method). The purpose
    of this paper is to describe both these models and some practical issues that
    need to be addressed if LSC is to be effectively used in radionuclide metrology.</p>"
