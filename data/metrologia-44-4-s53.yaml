  content: "<p>The equipment, working principles, performance and disturbing effects
    of re-entrant (or 4π) pressurized ionization-chamber measuring systems for activity
    determinations of photon-emitting radionuclide sources are described. Important
    features of these systems are the measuring geometry—generally reproducible and
    repeatable, ‘stable’ measurement conditions and instrument response, in particular
    linearity with varying activity. Properties of the current-measuring electronics
    are also considered. Basic equations for instrument calibrations and related uncertainties
    are given. A few applications, particularly half-life measurements, are represented.
    Finally, the bibliography of publications during the past ten years is reviewed.</p>"
