abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper begins with the reasons which led to the installation of
    the Système International de Référence (SIR) more than 30 years ago, describes
    its main features and presents briefly the way it works. Then more detail is given
    on the treatment of impurities and on the determination of the efficiency curve.
    The improvements, which have been made recently to update the SIR and make it
    more efficient, are also discussed. A brief survey of the status of the present
    SIR is then given before focusing on the new developments which are in progress
    to enlarge the scope of the SIR towards measurements of radiopharmaceuticals with
    short half-lives and of α- and β-particle emitters.</p>"
