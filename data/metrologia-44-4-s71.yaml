  content: "<p>The final accuracy of a radioactivity measurement can depend to a high
    degree on the quality of the radioactive sources used. In this paper the most
    important source preparation technique for radionuclide metrology is described
    in detail, namely the quantitative preparation of solid sources by drop deposition.
    Different steps in this source preparation procedure are described, such as preparation
    of source supports, preparation of dilutions, quantitative drop deposition by
    the pycnometer method, mass determination, control and improvement of the source
    quality and the uncertainty calculations involved. Other source preparation techniques
    of special interest are briefly mentioned and the handling and storage of solutions
    and sources are discussed.</p>"
