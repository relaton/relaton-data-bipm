  content: "<p>This paper describes the present status of radon (<sup>222</sup>Rn)
    reference standards developed by national metrology institutes. The main contributions
    to this field are reviewed with emphasis both on the traditional methods (based
    on <sup>226</sup>Ra standards) and also on the new absolute methods that have
    become available since 1996, especially those more recently developed. The topics
    covered include a description of the various methodologies adopted, instrumentation
    used, uncertainties achieved and the internal and international comparisons performed
    to demonstrate the validity of the developed standards.</p>"
