  content: "<p>The technological advances that have taken place during the past 45
    years in the fabrication of high purity germanium crystals have had a significant
    impact on low-level gamma-ray spectrometry. Today, Ge-detectors with high purity
    Ge-crystals of 2 kg are readily available and detectors with crystals up to 5 kg
    can be produced. Use of large area crystals results in high detection efficiencies,
    which can serve to reduce detection limits or to make faster measurements of low
    activity samples possible. The second major development that has contributed to
    lowering detection limits has been research on identifying and reducing the background
    components in gamma-ray spectrometry systems. This paper deals with the major
    technical factors affecting the performance of low-background HPGe-detectors and
    provides an overview of the major areas of application.</p>"
