abstract:
- content: "<p>The most intuitive way of defining a probability is perhaps through
    the frequency at which it appears when a large number of trials are realized in
    identical conditions. The probability derived from the obtained histogram characterizes
    the so-called frequentist or conventional statistical approach. In this sense,
    probability is defined as a physical property of the observed system. By contrast,
    in Bayesian statistics, a probability is not a physical property or a directly
    observable quantity, but a degree of belief or an element of inference. The goal
    of this paper is to show how Bayesian statistics can be used in radionuclide metrology
    and what its advantages and disadvantages are compared with conventional statistics.
    This is performed through the example of an yttrium-90 source typically encountered
    in environmental surveillance measurement. Because of the very low activity of
    this kind of source and the small half-life of the radionuclide, this measurement
    takes several days, during which the source decays significantly. Several methods
    are proposed to compute simultaneously the number of unstable nuclei at a given
    reference time, the decay constant and the background. Asymptotically, all approaches
    give the same result. However, Bayesian statistics produces coherent estimates
    and confidence intervals in a much smaller number of measurements. Apart from
    the conceptual understanding of statistics, the main difficulty that could deter
    radionuclide metrologists from using Bayesian statistics is the complexity of
    the computation.</p>"
