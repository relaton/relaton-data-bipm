  content: "<p>Secondary mass standards are usually made of stainless steel. One of
    the main problems in mass metrology is the stability of such stainless steel standards.
    Consequently, new materials have been investigated for the realization of mass
    standards, and this has led to the selection of nickel-based superalloys. The
    stability of materials is strongly dependent on surface reactivity; accelerated
    oxidation tests were performed, either in dry or wet air, and after a kinetic
    study, microstructural analysis of the oxide films was performed by scanning electron
    microscopy. The structure of the oxide films was also characterized by grazing
    x-ray diffraction and finally by x-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) analysis.
    XPS associated with sputtering by argon ions allowed us to differentiate the nature
    of the oxides from the outer surface to a given depth in the film.</p>"
