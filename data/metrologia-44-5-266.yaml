abstract:
- content: "<p>In mass metrology, the standards currently used are calibrated by a
    chain of comparisons, performed using mass comparators, that extends ultimately
    from the international prototype (which is the definition of the unit of mass)
    to the standards in routine use. The differences measured in the course of these
    comparisons become smaller and smaller as the standards approach the definitions
    of their units, precisely because of how accurately they have been adjusted.</p><p>One
    source of uncertainty in the determination of the difference of mass between the
    mass compared and the reference mass is the sensitivity error of the comparator
    used. Unfortunately, in the market there are no mass standards small enough (of
    the order of a few hundreds of micrograms) for a valid evaluation of this source
    of uncertainty. The users of these comparators therefore have no choice but to
    rely on the characteristics claimed by the makers of the comparators, or else
    to determine this sensitivity error at higher values (at least 1 mg) and interpolate
    from this result to smaller differences of mass.</p><p>For this reason, the LNE
    decided to produce and calibrate micro-mass standards having nominal values between
    100 µg and 900 µg. These standards were developed, then tested in multiple comparisons
    on an A5 type automatic comparator. They have since been qualified and calibrated
    in a weighing design, repeatedly and over an extended period of time, to establish
    their stability with respect to oxidation and the harmlessness of the handling
    and storage procedure associated with their use. Finally, the micro-standards
    so qualified were used to characterize the sensitivity errors of two of the LNE's
    mass comparators, including the one used to tie France's Platinum reference standard
    (Pt 35) to stainless steel and superalloy standards.</p>"
