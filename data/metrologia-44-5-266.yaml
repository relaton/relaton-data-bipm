    <p>In mass metrology, the standards currently used are calibrated by a chain of comparisons, performed using mass comparators, that extends ultimately from the international prototype (which is the definition of the unit of mass) to the standards in routine use. The differences measured in the course of these comparisons become smaller and smaller as the standards approach the definitions of their units, precisely because of how accurately they have been adjusted.</p>
    <p>One source of uncertainty in the determination of the difference of mass between the mass compared and the reference mass is the sensitivity error of the comparator used. Unfortunately, in the market there are no mass standards small enough (of the order of a few hundreds of micrograms) for a valid evaluation of this source of uncertainty. The users of these comparators therefore have no choice but to rely on the characteristics claimed by the makers of the comparators, or else to determine this sensitivity error at higher values (at least 1 mg) and interpolate from this result to smaller differences of mass.</p>
    <p>For this reason, the LNE decided to produce and calibrate micro-mass standards having nominal values between 100 µg and 900 µg. These standards were developed, then tested in multiple comparisons on an A5 type automatic comparator. They have since been qualified and calibrated in a weighing design, repeatedly and over an extended period of time, to establish their stability with respect to oxidation and the harmlessness of the handling and storage procedure associated with their use. Finally, the micro-standards so qualified were used to characterize the sensitivity errors of two of the LNE's mass comparators, including the one used to tie France's Platinum reference standard (Pt 35) to stainless steel and superalloy standards.</p>
