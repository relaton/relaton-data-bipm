  content: "<p>This paper deals with the evaluation of the uncertainty in the equilibrium
    value of the eutectic temperature of the eutectic systems Fe–C and Co–C in their
    pure state. The first step towards this is deriving the equilibrium value of the
    liquidus temperature of the actual impure system and its associated uncertainty,
    the second estimating the uncertainty in the correction for the effect of impurities.
    The derivation of liquidus temperature and its uncertainty from the observed melting
    behaviour forms the core of this study. It involves the extrapolation of the measured
    melting plateaus, obtained at finite growth rates of the preceding freezes, towards
    the plateau related to zero growth rate, i.e. to the state of structural thermodynamic
    equilibrium. The uncertainty in the correction for the effect of impurities will
    be evaluated by means of ‘the sum of individual estimates’ and ‘the overall maximum
    estimate’, earlier shown to be applicable to eutectic systems.</p>"
