  content: "<p>An experimental assembly has been constructed to measure the specific
    heat capacity of macroscopic graphite samples at room temperature. The same batch
    of graphite constitutes the core of a graphite calorimeter, which is currently
    being realized to measure the absorbed dose due to ionizing radiation. Two different
    experimental procedures have been applied. In the first method the specific heat
    capacity of graphite was measured directly, where its value is corrected for the
    influence of impurities. The second method, to our knowledge not previously applied
    to macroscopic samples, is based on a series of differential measurements where
    no correction for added impurities is needed. By its nature, the second method
    reduces systematic effects. The specific heat capacity of a particular graphite
    sample is determined to be 706.9 J K<sup>−1</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> with a combined
    relative standard uncertainty of 9 parts in 10<sup>4</sup> at 295.15 K. The specific
    heat capacity of cyanoacrylate has also been determined.</p>"
