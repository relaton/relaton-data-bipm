  content: "<p>The shift of the melting curves of Zn samples was measured as a function
    of impurity concentration by explicit doping with some of the impurities that
    are usually present in high purity Zn samples. The following shifts were obtained
    in mK/ppm wt (mass fraction in parts per million) for Fe, Pb, Cd, In, Cu, Ag and
    Au, respectively: −0.51, −0.27, −0.33, −0.39, +0.23, +0.26 and +0.078.</p>"
