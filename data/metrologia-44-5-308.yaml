abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirement to aggregate measurement data, in the case where each
    measured value corresponds to nominally the same quantity, is important throughout
    metrology. Correlation associated with measured values is shown to arise in a
    number of measurement problems, with examples taken from the areas of interlaboratory
    comparisons, including key comparisons, the calibration of measuring systems and
    instruments, wireless sensor networks and prediction on the basis of different
    models. Consideration is given to the effect that correlation has on the determination
    of an aggregated estimate of the measured quantity, and on testing the consistency
    of measurement data. Approaches to quantifying the correlation associated with
    measured values are presented, and a formulation is given of the problem of determining
    the largest consistent subset of data having associated correlation. Results for
    three measurement problems are given, concerned with an interlaboratory comparison
    of noise in a coaxial line, the calibration of a thermometer and the analysis
    of data arising from a wireless sensor network.</p>"
