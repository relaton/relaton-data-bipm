abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper is concerned with bringing together the topics of uncertainty
    evaluation using a Monte Carlo method, distributed computing for data parallel
    applications and pseudo-random number generation. A study of a measurement system
    to estimate the absolute thermodynamic temperatures of two high-temperature blackbodies
    by measuring the ratios of their spectral radiances is used to illustrate the
    application of these topics. The uncertainties associated with the estimates of
    the temperatures are evaluated and used to inform the experimental realization
    of the system. The difficulties associated with determining model sensitivity
    coefficients, and demonstrating whether a linearization of the model is adequate,
    are avoided by using a Monte Carlo method as an approach to uncertainty evaluation.
    A distributed computing system is used to undertake the Monte Carlo calculation
    because the computational effort required to evaluate the measurement model can
    be significant. In order to ensure that the results provided by a Monte Carlo
    method implemented on a distributed computing system are reliable, consideration
    is given to the approach to generating pseudo-random numbers, which constitutes
    a key component of the Monte Carlo procedure.</p>"
