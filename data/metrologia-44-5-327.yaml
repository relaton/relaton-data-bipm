  content: "<p>The identification of the measurand in a comparison of standards may
    seem a simple matter. This choice can, however, be complicated by (extremely)
    varied interpretations, as this paper seeks to show. Cases affected by possible
    ambiguities are presented, involving the intrinsic nature of the standard, the
    way the standard is implemented or the way the comparison is conducted. Ambiguities
    can lead to controversial scientific and formal decisions. The paper reviews and
    discusses a broad variety of aspects of measurand identification that have arisen
    in CIPM key comparisons, mainly in thermal metrology.</p>"
