  content: "<p>The Welch–Satterthwaite (W–S) formula described in the <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> enables an effective
    number of degrees of freedom to be associated with the standard uncertainty of
    a measurement estimate. This facilitates the calculation of an expanded uncertainty
    interval for the value of the measurand. However, the W–S formula is only applicable
    when the components of measurement error with finite degrees of freedom are uncorrelated.
    This paper considers the generalization of the formula to accommodate correlated
    components with finite degrees of freedom. We show that the number of degrees
    of freedom to be associated with any estimate derived from repeated observation
    of several quantities is <italic>n</italic> − 1, where <italic>n</italic> is the
    number of sets of observations, and we then give two equations by which the number
    of effective degrees may be calculated.</p>"
