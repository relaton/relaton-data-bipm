abstract:
- content: "<p>The Welch–Satterthwaite (W–S) formula described in the Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement enables an effective number of degrees
    of freedom to be associated with the standard uncertainty of a measurement estimate.
    This facilitates the calculation of an expanded uncertainty interval for the value
    of the measurand. However, the W–S formula is only applicable when the components
    of measurement error with finite degrees of freedom are uncorrelated. This paper
    considers the generalization of the formula to accommodate correlated components
    with finite degrees of freedom. We show that the number of degrees of freedom
    to be associated with any estimate derived from repeated observation of several
    quantities is n − 1, where n is the number of sets of observations, and we then
    give two equations by which the number of effective degrees may be calculated.</p>"
