abstract:
- content: "<p>A procedure is proposed to calculate the uncertainty of the energy
    content associated with real-time flow measurements of natural gas. The procedure
    was applied to a measuring scheme consisting of an arrangement of orifice plate
    meters installed in parallel, coupled to an on-line gas chromatograph and a real-time
    data processing flow computer. Two distinct sources of natural gas with appreciable
    fluctuations in chemical properties were considered. The analysis suggests that
    the uncertainty depends mainly on these fluctuations, on the flow regime and on
    systematic errors. The work also suggests that the chemical analysis-sampling
    rate plays an important role in the overall uncertainty budget.</p>"
