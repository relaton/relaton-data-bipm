  content: "<p>Recent proposals to redefine four of the base units of the International
    System (SI) have stimulated some debate as to how the SI might best be developed
    to meet changes in requirements. In this paper we consider whether the proposals
    are a timely and proportionate response to those changes in requirements that
    can be identified today. We conclude that, whilst the proposed changes to the
    definitions of the mole and kelvin appear to have some advantages, the case for
    changes in the definitions of the ampere and the kilogram is less well made at
    the present stage of development of the key experiments involved.</p>"
