abstract:
- content: "<p>The problem is addressed of determining numerical approximations to
    the area under a curve specified by arbitrarily spaced data. A formulation of
    this problem is given in which the data are used to model the curve as a piecewise
    polynomial, each piece having the same degree. That piecewise function is integrated
    to provide an approximation to the area. A corresponding compound quadrature rule
    is derived. Different degrees of polynomial give rise to different orders of quadrature
    rule. The widely used trapezoidal rule is a special case, as is the Gillâ€“Miller
    rule. The remainder of the paper is concerned with evaluating the measurement
    uncertainties associated with the approximations to the area obtained by the use
    of these rules in the case where the data ordinates correspond to measured values
    having stated associated uncertainties. The case in which there is correlation
    associated with the measured values, frequently arising when the measured values
    are obtained using the same measuring instrument, is also treated. A statistical
    test is used to select a suitable polynomial degree.</p>"
