  content: "<p>Two methods are presented by which a straight line is to be fitted
    to a cloud of points in Cartesian coordinates. It is assumed that data are available
    in the form of a series of measurements in each coordinate, together with an assessment
    of their covariance matrices. In the first (probabilistic) method, the joint probability
    density function (PDF) for the two parameters of the straight line is considered.
    An explicit expression for this PDF is derived; it allows one to compute numerically
    the expectations, the variances and the covariance between the two parameters
    of the straight line. The second method is that of least-squares; it renders a
    non-linear system of equations for the point estimates of the parameters, as well
    as an approximation to their covariance matrix. In contrast to least-squares,
    the probabilistic method allows for the exact calculation of the probability that
    the true values of the parameters lie within specified intervals.</p>"
