abstract:
- content: "<p>Taiwan has more than 300 Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking stations
    maintained by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), Academia Sinica, the Central
    Weather Bureau and the Central Geological Survey. In the future, GPS tracking
    stations may replace the GPS control points after being given a legal status.
    Hence, the data quality of the tracking stations is an increasingly significant
    factor. This study considers the feasibility of establishing a system for monitoring
    GPS receivers. This investigation employs many data-quality indices and examines
    the relationship of these indices and the positioning precision. The frequency
    stability of the GPS receiver is the most important index; the cycle slip is the
    second index and the multipath is the third index. An auto-analytical system for
    analysing GPS data quality and monitoring the MOI's tracking stations can quickly
    find and resolve problems, or changes in station environment, to maintain high
    data quality for the tracking stations.</p>"
