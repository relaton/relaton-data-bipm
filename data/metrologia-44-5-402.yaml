  content: "<p>The atomic-scale unit, entity (ent), is defined as the number-specific
    amount of substance, <italic>n</italic>/<italic>N</italic>, the amount of substance
    of a single entity. This unit is an invariant physical quantity (the reciprocal
    of the Avogadro constant) that serves as the basis for redefining the SI base
    unit for amount of substance in a direct and easily understood manner. It is argued
    here that the kilomole should be the <italic>base</italic> unit in order to avoid
    factors of 10<sup>−3</sup> or 10<sup>3</sup> appearing in relationships involving
    both mass and amount of substance expressed in base units. Since, in a compatible
    formulation, the amount-specific number of entities, <italic>N</italic>/<italic>n</italic>
    (= <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>), is equal to <italic>M</italic><sub>u</sub>/Da,
    exactly, where <italic>M</italic><sub>u</sub> = kg kmol<sup>−1</sup> = g mol<sup>−1</sup>
    = Da ent<sup>−1</sup>, exactly, then <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> = (kg/Da) kmol<sup>−1</sup>
    = (g/Da) mol<sup>−1</sup> = 1 ent<sup>−1</sup>, exactly. The kilomole can thus
    be defined very simply as: \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro255520in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    exactly, where \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro255520in002.gif\"></inline-graphic>,
    the <italic>exact</italic> kilomole-to-entity <italic>amount</italic> ratio, is
    identical to the kilogram-to-dalton <italic>mass</italic> ratio: \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro255520in003.gif\"></inline-graphic>. The Avogadro constant,
    \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro255520in004.gif\"></inline-graphic>, does
    not appear explicitly in the defining equation, its reciprocal having been replaced
    by one entity. Like the dalton, the entity would be categorized as a unit in use
    with SI.</p>"
