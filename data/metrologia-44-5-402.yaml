abstract:
- content: "<p>The atomic-scale unit, entity (ent), is defined as the number-specific
    amount of substance, n/N, the amount of substance of a single entity. This unit
    is an invariant physical quantity (the reciprocal of the Avogadro constant) that
    serves as the basis for redefining the SI base unit for amount of substance in
    a direct and easily understood manner. It is argued here that the kilomole should
    be the base unit in order to avoid factors of 10<sup>−3</sup> or 10<sup>3</sup>
    appearing in relationships involving both mass and amount of substance expressed
    in base units. Since, in a compatible formulation, the amount-specific number
    of entities, N/n (= N<sub>A</sub>), is equal to M<sub>u</sub>/Da, exactly, where
    M<sub>u</sub> = kg kmol<sup>−1</sup> = g mol<sup>−1</sup> = Da ent<sup>−1</sup>,
    exactly, then N<sub>A</sub> = (kg/Da) kmol<sup>−1</sup> = (g/Da) mol<sup>−1</sup>
    = 1 ent<sup>−1</sup>, exactly. The kilomole can thus be defined very simply as:,
    exactly, where, the exact kilomole-to-entity amount ratio, is identical to the
    kilogram-to-dalton mass ratio:. The Avogadro constant,, does not appear explicitly
    in the defining equation, its reciprocal having been replaced by one entity. Like
    the dalton, the entity would be categorized as a unit in use with SI.</p>"
