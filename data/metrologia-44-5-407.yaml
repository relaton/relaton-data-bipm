abstract:
- content: "<p>An accurate determination of the dose produced by brachytherapy seeds
    emitting low-energy photons is an important component of the radiotherapeutic
    process. As yet, the output of these seeds has usually been specified in terms
    of the air kerma rate. The desired quantity in radiation therapy is, however,
    the absorbed dose to water inside a water phantom, for which primary standards
    are not available.</p><p>For this reason, developments are under way in the Physikalisch-
    Technische Bundesanstalt to establish a primary standard to determine the absorbed
    dose to water within a phantom. As a fundamental step towards this aim, a method
    will be introduced in this publication to determine the water kerma inside a graphite
    phantom housing an extrapolation chamber. Experimental results will be presented
    and compared with water kerma values obtained from air kerma measurements in free
    air and applying a conversion factor to water kerma for the conditions of the
    experiment. First estimates indicate that the relative uncertainty is of the order
    of 1% (k = 1).</p>"
