abstract:
- content: "<p>The most widely used procedure for finding the value of a quantity
    from data obtained from interlaboratory comparisons involves calculating the inverse-variance
    weighted mean of the laboratories' estimates. This method produces adequate results
    if the data are consistent. However, sometimes a consistency test reveals the
    possible existence of outliers that nevertheless have to be included in the evaluation
    task. In this paper the Bayesian understanding of probability is used to derive
    three methods that may be applied in the case when the data appear to be inconsistent.
    The performances of these methods are compared through a simulated example.</p>"
