abstract:
- content: "<p>Distinguishing between a supercooled dew and frost below 0 °C in dew/frost-point
    measurements is an important and challenging problem that has not yet been completely
    solved. This study presents a new method for the recognition of a supercooled
    dew in a dew/frost-point sensor. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor was
    used as a dew/frost-point sensor to detect a dew and a supercooled dew as well
    as frost. The slip phenomenon occurring at an interface between the water droplet
    and the surface of the quartz crystal resonator of the QCM sensor gives a simple
    and accurate way of distinguishing between a supercooled dew and frost below 0 °C.
    This method can give a highly accurate measurement of the dew or the frost point
    without misreading in the dew-point sensor at temperatures below 0 °C.</p>"
