  content: "<p>We present improved results for the ac longitudinal resistance at the
    high-potential side of a quantum Hall device. Previous measurements indicated
    a different frequency- and current-dependence at either side of a device. This
    asymmetry is now attributed to a loading effect which has been overlooked. When
    the measuring bridge is modified to eliminate this effect, the ac longitudinal
    resistances at the high- and the low-potential side show a very similar and consistent
    behaviour.</p>"
