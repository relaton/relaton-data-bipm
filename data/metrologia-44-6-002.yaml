abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, the determination of the density of air is the main source of
    uncertainty (10 µg) in a comparison of a platinum–iridium alloy national prototype
    with a stainless steel reference standard. The method currently recommended by
    the BIPM is to calculate this density, using a formula developed in 1981 and revised
    in 1991 by the CIPM, from the measured values of the pressure, temperature, hygrometry
    and molar fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> in air. Recent work has found significant
    differences between the values given by this formula and those given by a method
    using artefacts having identical masses and very different volumes (6.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
    with a relative uncertainty of 1.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). To investigate this difference,
    the BIPM asked the member laboratories of the Consultatitve Committee for Mass
    (CCM) to investigate two lines of approach:</p><p>- check the composition of the
    air, in particular the argon content, which may explain the discrepancies found;
    this is the object of a study by the chemical metrology unit of LNE (see the article
    by Sutour et al in this issue),</p><p>- study the behavior of artefacts during
    the air–vacuum transfer in a comparator that can work both in a controlled atmosphere
    and in a vacuum, to confirm or not confirm the discrepancies; this latter study
    is the object of this paper.</p>"
