abstract:
- content: "<p>During 2006 modifications were made to the NPL Mark II moving-coil
    watt balance which eliminated several significant sources of error. The apparatus
    was run from October 2006 to March 2007 to check its operation and to produce
    a preliminary value of Planck's constant h. This paper reports the current state
    of the work and predicts the uncertainty that is expected to be achievable with
    the existing apparatus. The preliminary value of h is 6.626 070 95(44) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s,
    which corresponds to a value of the Avogadro constant of N<sub>A</sub> = 6.022 139 99(40)
    × 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p>"
