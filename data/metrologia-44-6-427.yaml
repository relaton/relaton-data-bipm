  content: "<p>During 2006 modifications were made to the NPL Mark II moving-coil
    watt balance which eliminated several significant sources of error. The apparatus
    was run from October 2006 to March 2007 to check its operation and to produce
    a preliminary value of Planck's constant <italic>h</italic>. This paper reports
    the current state of the work and predicts the uncertainty that is expected to
    be achievable with the existing apparatus. The preliminary value of <italic>h</italic>
    is 6.626 070 95(44) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s, which corresponds to a value of the
    Avogadro constant of <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> = 6.022 139 99(40) × 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p>"
