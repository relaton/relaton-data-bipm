    <p>Today, the determination of the density of air is the main source of uncertainty (10 µg) in a comparison of a platinum–iridium alloy national prototype with a stainless steel reference standard. The method currently recommended by the BIPM is to calculate this density, using a formula developed in 1981 and revised in 1991 by the CIPM, from the measured values of the pressure, temperature, hygrometry and molar fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> in air. Recent work has found significant differences between the values given by this formula and those given by a method using artefacts having identical masses and very different volumes (6.4 × 10<sup>−5</sup> with a relative uncertainty of 1.2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). To investigate this difference, the BIPM asked the member laboratories of the Consultatitve Committee for Mass (CCM) to investigate two lines of approach:</p>
    <p>- check the composition of the air, in particular the argon content, which may explain the discrepancies found; this is the object of a study by the chemical metrology unit of LNE (see the article by Sutour <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> in this issue),</p>
    <p>- study the behavior of artefacts during the air–vacuum transfer in a comparator that can work both in a controlled atmosphere and in a vacuum, to confirm or not confirm the discrepancies; this latter study is the object of this paper.</p>
