abstract:
- content: "<p>When employing either gravimetric or volumetric methods for the calibration
    of flowmeters, volumetric measures and proving tanks, knowledge of the density
    of water is required. In addition, when measuring flow of water and calibrating
    flow meters, the compressibility, viscosity and speed of sound may also be needed.
    In the scientific literature, different formulae are used to express the properties
    of water. This is particularly noticeable in the case of equations for the density
    of water as given in standards. Different expressions have been referenced and
    included in International Standards Organisation, Organisation for International
    Legal Metrology documents and petroleum measurement standards from the American
    Petroleum Institute and the Energy Institute based on when the standard was prepared
    or which group prepared it. This variation does not generally give rise to significant
    differences in density; however, inconsistencies may cause problems for trade
    when small differences in the value of a product occur. In this paper, some of
    the most commonly referenced expressions have been given and compared. Finally,
    recommendations have been suggested to allow the most appropriate selection of
    formulae to suit the application. The effect of contamination has been examined
    and this has been extended to include salt water, which now requires high standards
    of measurement for the oil industry. The aim of the paper is to provide a set
    of practical formulae which can be used to reduce differences in measurement,
    ensure low uncertainties for measurement and provide an understanding of and reference
    source for the identification of unattributed formulae where they occur. The practical
    formulae provided here will apply equally to measurement at the highest levels
    of volume determinations, through to industrial and scientific volume and flow
    measurement applications using water.</p>"
