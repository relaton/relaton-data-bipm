    <p>According to the <italic toggle="yes">Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (GUM) (1995, Geneva, Switzerland: International Organization for Standardization (ISO)), the uncertainty in an estimate of the value of a measurand is assessed by propagating the uncertainty in estimates of values of input quantities, based on a <italic toggle="yes">measurement equation</italic> that expresses the former value as a known function of the latter values. However, in measurement situations where some of the input quantities in turn depend on the measurand, this approach is circuitous and ultimately impracticable.</p>
    <p>An alternative approach starts from the <italic toggle="yes">observation equation</italic>, which relates the experimental data to the measurand: this allows a uniform treatment of the most diverse metrological problems, and, once it is used in the context of Bayesian inference, also facilitates the exploitation of any information that may pre-exist about the measurand, alongside the information that fresh experimental data provide about it.</p>
    <p>The widest applicability of the observation equation approach is illustrated with detailed examples concerning the lifetime of mechanical parts, the measurement of mass, the calibration of a non-linear model in biochemistry and the estimation of a consensus value for arsenic concentration in a sample measured by multiple laboratories.</p>
