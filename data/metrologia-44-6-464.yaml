abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    (GUM) (1995, Geneva, Switzerland: International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO)), the uncertainty in an estimate of the value of a measurand is assessed
    by propagating the uncertainty in estimates of values of input quantities, based
    on a measurement equation that expresses the former value as a known function
    of the latter values. However, in measurement situations where some of the input
    quantities in turn depend on the measurand, this approach is circuitous and ultimately
    impracticable.</p><p>An alternative approach starts from the observation equation,
    which relates the experimental data to the measurand: this allows a uniform treatment
    of the most diverse metrological problems, and, once it is used in the context
    of Bayesian inference, also facilitates the exploitation of any information that
    may pre-exist about the measurand, alongside the information that fresh experimental
    data provide about it.</p><p>The widest applicability of the observation equation
    approach is illustrated with detailed examples concerning the lifetime of mechanical
    parts, the measurement of mass, the calibration of a non-linear model in biochemistry
    and the estimation of a consensus value for arsenic concentration in a sample
    measured by multiple laboratories.</p>"
