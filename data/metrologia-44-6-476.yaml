  content: "<p>This paper presents an approach for making inference on the parameters
    μ and σ of a Gaussian distribution in the presence of resolution errors. The approach
    is based on the principle of fiducial inference and requires a Monte Carlo method
    for computing uncertainty intervals. A small simulation study is carried out to
    evaluate the performance of the proposed procedure and compare it with some of
    the existing procedures. The results indicate that the fiducial procedure is comparable
    to the best of the competing procedures for inference on μ. However, unlike some
    of the competing procedures, the same Monte Carlo calculations also provide inference
    for σ and many other related quantities of interest.</p>"
