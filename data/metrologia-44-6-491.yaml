  content: "<p>This note rectifies oversights and errors in the author's recent paper
    about a clock ensemble algorithm based on a modified Kalman filter. It is shown
    by simulation and theory that initial frequency state errors can cause the corrected
    clocks to diverge linearly with time. Two statements about the Brown ensemble
    algorithm are corrected, and results of that algorithm are compared with those
    of the author's algorithm for a simulated three-clock ensemble.</p>"
