abstract:
- content: "<p>Comparison of measurement results obtained by different measuring equipment
    on the same reference object is a key element in equipment qualification. The
    paper discusses an approach for an integrated assessment of a series of comparison
    measurements taken on more than one (i.e. many) reference object(s). The approach
    accounts for the fact that measurements taken by one (and also by the other) instrument
    on a series of ideally independent objects are nevertheless partially correlated
    due to common uncertainty contributions arising from the measurement process.
    The approach is exemplified for international comparisons using a (travelling)
    transfer instrument for the comparison of national instrument standards with a
    reference standard over a range of measured ozone mole fractions.</p>"
