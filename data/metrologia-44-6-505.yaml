abstract:
- content: "<p>We measure a cryogenic, vacuum-gap capacitor by two methods: (1) charging
    it with a known number of electrons and measuring the resulting voltage, and (2)
    using a capacitance bridge traceable to the SI farad. We report a detailed uncertainty
    budget for the comparison of the two methods and find that they agree within a
    relative standard uncertainty of 9.2 × 10<sup>−7</sup>. This comparison closes
    the quantum metrology triangle with the same uncertainty.</p>"
