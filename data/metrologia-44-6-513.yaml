abstract:
- content: "<p>An object of this paper is to discuss the logical development of the
    concept of uncertainty in measurement and the methods for its quantification from
    the classical error analysis to the modern approaches based on the Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). We review authoritative literature
    on error analysis and then discuss its limitations which motivated the experts
    from the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM), the International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and various national metrology institutes
    to develop specific recommendations which form the basis of the GUM. We discuss
    the new concepts introduced by the GUM and their merits and limitations. The limitations
    of the GUM led the BIPM Joint Committee on Guides in Metrology to develop an alternative
    approachâ€”the draft Supplement 1 to the GUM (draft GUM-S1). We discuss the draft
    GUM-S1 and its merits and limitations. We hope this discussion will lead to a
    more effective use of the GUM and the draft GUM-S1 and stimulate investigations
    leading to further improvements in the methods to quantify uncertainty in measurement.</p>"
