abstract:
- content: "<p>The argon and helium pressure in two types of temperature fixed-point
    cell enclosure has been measured for over two weeks. It was found that there was
    no significant change in the argon pressure over this time, in contrast to the
    report of Ancsin (2003 Metrologia 40 232–4). Helium was found to diffuse out of
    the cell as expected. We conclude that argon is a suitable ‘back-fill’ gas for
    fixed-point cells.</p>"
