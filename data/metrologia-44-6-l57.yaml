  content: <p>A recent paper by Ignacio Lira in this journal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
    xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/43/4/S09">2006 <italic>Metrologia</italic>
    <bold>43</bold> S231–4</ext-link>) proposes a new procedure to evaluate the data
    from a simple key comparison where a travelling standard of a stable value during
    the comparison is independently measured by the participants. In particular, Lira
    presents an expression, which he claims to be the kernel of a Bayesian posterior
    probability density function for the value of the measurand. Lira claims that
    his expression encodes the collective state of knowledge whether or not the results
    are consistent. Thus Lira offers an alternative to the method recommended by an
    Advisory Group on Uncertainties commissioned by the BIPM. We discuss Lira's procedure
    from the viewpoint of what we believe to be a good practice of Bayesian statistics.</p>
