  content: "<p>Several issues are discussed that relate to the evaluation of measurement
    uncertainty for complex-valued quantities in radio frequency measurements. In
    situations where there is information about the magnitude of a complex quantity,
    but not phase, uniform distributions in the form of a disc or a ring may be appropriate
    representations for the uncertainty. Variance–covariance matrices for these distributions
    are given for use in bivariate uncertainty calculations. The situation in which
    an uncertainty statement is provided in polar coordinates is also discussed. Such
    uncertainty statements need to be transformed into the real–imaginary coordinate
    system for the preferred method of uncertainty calculation. A simple transformation
    procedure is described together with a method to assess its accuracy.</p>"
