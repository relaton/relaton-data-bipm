  content: <p>The argon and helium pressure in two types of temperature fixed-point
    cell enclosure has been measured for over two weeks. It was found that there was
    no significant change in the argon pressure over this time, in contrast to the
    report of Ancsin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/40/5/304">2003
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>40</bold> 232–4</ext-link>). Helium was found
    to diffuse out of the cell as expected. We conclude that argon is a suitable ‘back-fill’
    gas for fixed-point cells.</p>
