abstract:
- content: "<p>Uncertainty in the empirically derived vapour pressure formulations
    must be incorporated in uncertainty budgets for a laboratory's humidity calibration
    and measurement capabilities and must be considered in any traceable humidity
    calibration. Uncertainty associated with the water vapour pressure enhancement
    factor is a strong function of pressure and temperature and may not be accurately
    reported since it is usually given in the form of a look-up table or as a single
    value that generally overestimates the true uncertainty. To facilitate automatic
    calculation and accurate reporting of uncertainty, an expression for the uncertainty
    in the vapour pressure enhancement factor for moist air is presented here. The
    expression is based on the analysis of Wexler and Hyland in their work for ASHRAE
    Project RP-216 and is valid from −100 °C to 200 °C and from 0.01 MPa to 10 MPa.</p><p>Some
    implications of possible significant systematic error in the Wexler and Hyland
    values of the enhancement factor are discussed briefly.</p>"
