abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent paper by Ignacio Lira in this journal ( 2006  Metrologia   43
    \ S231–4 ) proposes a new procedure to evaluate the data from a simple key comparison
    where a travelling standard of a stable value during the comparison is independently
    measured by the participants. In particular, Lira presents an expression, which
    he claims to be the kernel of a Bayesian posterior probability density function
    for the value of the measurand. Lira claims that his expression encodes the collective
    state of knowledge whether or not the results are consistent. Thus Lira offers
    an alternative to the method recommended by an Advisory Group on Uncertainties
    commissioned by the BIPM. We discuss Lira's procedure from the viewpoint of what
    we believe to be a good practice of Bayesian statistics.</p>"
