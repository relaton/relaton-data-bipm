abstract:
- content: "<p>The process of estimating a measurand is based on the choice of an
    appropriate estimator. The metrologist usually makes this choice by comparing
    estimator properties such as unbiasedness, efficiency and robustness.</p><p>We
    show that when dealing with asymmetric parent distributions, the expected value
    might not correspond to the measurand value; hence it might not be the correct
    parameter to estimate. In such cases, another location parameter can fit the measurand
    better and the properties of candidate estimators should be assessed in relation
    to such parameters.</p><p>The paper discusses two examples with reference to the
    class of the  L<sub> p</sub> parameters and estimators, which include several
    commonly used in metrology.</p>"
