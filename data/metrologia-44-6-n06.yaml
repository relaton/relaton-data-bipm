- content: "<p>The result of extensive Monte Carlo calculations and a re-evaluation
    of the volume of the primary standard has led to an increase in the determination
    of air kerma at the VNIIM by 9.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The contributions to this
    change are summarized in this short note to announce that the VNIIM primary standard
    changed with effect from 1 November 2007.</p>"
