abstract:
- content: "<p>High purity tin samples were doped with Fe, Sb, Pb, In and Al. These
    impurities shifted the run-off point of the melting curve of tin by −0.75 mK (ppm wt)<sup>−1</sup>,
    +0.23 mK (ppm wt)<sup>−1</sup>, −0.16 mK (ppm wt)<sup>−1</sup>, −0.21 mK (ppm wt)<sup>−1</sup>
    and −2.3 mK (ppm wt)<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (ppm wt denoted the mass fraction
    in parts million). However, 1654 ppm wt of Fe and 12.2 ppm wt of Al concentrations
    appear to supersaturate tin. The extra amount of these impurities then gradually
    precipitated as the doped samples were subjected to repeat melting.</p><p>In the
    10 ppm wt Fe to about 970 ppm wt Fe concentration range tin has a solid–liquid
    phase transformation of very narrow melting range, 6.9 mK below the tin-point.</p>"
