abstract:
- content: "<p>A procedure is presented to evaluate the uncertainty of integrals computed
    from an approximate function that interpolates a set of measured data. The procedure,
    a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty propagation technique, yields the integral uncertainty
    taking into account the uncertainties associated with the involved experimental
    data. As expected, we found that the uncertainty of the integral strongly depends
    on the error sources affecting the ordinates. As an example, we assessed the uncertainty
    of the so-called UV index, evaluated by integrating in the range 250 nm to 400 nm
    the biologically weighted spectral ultraviolet irradiance. The presented procedure
    agrees with international recommendations and is valid independently of the experimental
    technique from which data are obtained.</p>"
