  content: "<p>The quantum metrology triangle is a test of the consistency of three
    quantum electrical standards: the single-electron tunnelling current standard,
    the Josephson voltage standard and the quantum Hall resistance standard. This
    paper considers what is known about each of these effects separately in terms
    of (1) theory, (2) empirical tests of universality and (3) ‘direct’ tests involving
    fundamental constants. The current status of each of the three ‘legs’ of the triangle
    is quite different, with the single-electron leg being the weakest by far. This
    leads to the conclusion that a recent experimental result for the triangle should
    be interpreted primarily in terms of corrections to the quantum of charge transferred
    by single-electron devices.</p>"
