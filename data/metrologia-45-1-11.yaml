  content: "<p>Methods for reducing reflectance losses at multiple wavelengths with
    a silicon photodiode detector are described. Using thick oxide layer and Brewster-angle
    operation it is shown that specular reflectance losses can be theoretically decreased
    below 1 ppm (part per million) in a simple measurement arrangement. Additionally,
    a detector structure is presented which can be used to reduce the measurement
    uncertainties due to diffuse reflectance below 1 ppm, even if the total diffuse
    reflectance losses from a plain photodiode would be two orders of magnitude larger.</p>"
