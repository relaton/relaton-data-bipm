abstract:
- content: "<p>We have examined the influence of surface stress in the measurement
    of the (2 2 0) lattice plane spacing of a Si crystal by combined x-ray and optical
    interferometry. By means of a finite element simulation we have obtained first
    a quantitative description of various non-linear displacement fields of the diffracting
    planes; the simulation indicates that surface stress does not cause a significant
    difference between bulk and surface lattice spacing. Subsequently, to quantify
    the effect of the above fields on the period of the interference fringes, we have
    solved numerically the perturbed Takagi–Taupin equations; these results indicate
    that the fringe period is determined by the atom spacing on the crystal entrance
    surface, whereas, intuitively, we might have expected this period to be a kind
    of average of the (2 2 0) lattice plane spacing. To corroborate our numerical
    calculations, we have found analytical expressions which allow us to isolate the
    contribution of the non-linear superficial terms on the measurement of the plane
    spacing.</p>"
