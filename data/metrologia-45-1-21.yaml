  content: "<p>A simple method of evaluating the measurement capability of a practical
    Fizeau-type flatness measurement machine is proposed. In this method, by measuring
    only the peak-to-valley (PV) value of a calibrated test flat, the measurement
    capability of the flatness measurement machine for the PV value is evaluated while
    maintaining the traceability of the measurement. A simple approximate equation
    for estimating the measurement capability of the flatness measurement machine
    is presented.</p>"
