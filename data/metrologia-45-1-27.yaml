  content: "<p>By applying the Algos timescale algorithm to a worldwide ensemble of
    clocks, the BIPM calculates the offset of UTC from the UTC realization of each
    participating laboratory. Given the uncertainties and correlations of the time-transfer
    links between the laboratories, one can evaluate the resultant uncertainties and
    correlations of the offsets. This paper gives an improved and simplified method
    for carrying out these evaluations.</p>"
