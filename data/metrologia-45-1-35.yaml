  content: "<p>Since the 1980s, GPS time links have been essential to the TAI computation
    and, until 2006, the Common View (CV) technique has been used for this purpose.
    Recent advances in obtaining precise satellite orbits and clock parameters now
    permit us to obtain better results using another technique, which we name All
    in View (AV). By comparing the GPS CV and AV with the independent and more accurate
    TW and PPP time transfer techniques, we quantify the gain that can be obtained
    on a given time link. The AV technique also allows us to choose a more efficient
    network of GPS links between the tens of laboratories participating in TAI, which
    further improves the uncertainty in the access to UTC. The BIPM TAI software has
    been updated and the AV technique has been effectively used since the computation
    for the month of September 2006.</p>"
