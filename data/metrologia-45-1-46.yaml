abstract:
- content: "<p>A constant pressure gas flowmeter using a directly driven diaphragm
    bellows as a volume displacer was studied. This flowmeter is perfectly vacuum-sealed,
    does not contain elastomers and liquids that would prevent outgassing at elevated
    temperatures and can achieve a smaller ratio of the final volume to the displaced
    volume than when bellows are used, so that the uncertainty in generating small
    flow rates can be small. As, when a bellows is used in the volume displacer, the
    displaced volume cannot be calculated from the geometric dimensions and its dependence
    on the displacement is non-linear, a sensitive method had to be developed for
    measuring this dependence. The uncertainty in measuring the displaced volume by
    this method and the achieved uncertainty of the flowmeter were determined.</p>"
