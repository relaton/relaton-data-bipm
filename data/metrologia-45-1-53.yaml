  content: "<p>General theory for uncertainty propagations of atomic weight measurement
    results is presented and the impact of correlation of input variables (isotope
    ratios and correction factors) on the overall atomic weight uncertainty is discussed.
    Currently all uncertainty propagations use equations that are fitted for uncorrelated
    isotope ratios and uncorrelated mass bias correction factors. It is shown here
    that the correlation of isotope ratios is significant in TIMS and multi-collector
    ICPMS measurements and ignoring these correlations can lead to significant underestimation
    of the uncertainty of atomic weight measurement results. Atomic weight uncertainties
    are inconsistent with reported isotope ratio uncertainties in numerous recent
    reports as a result of improper uncertainty propagation.</p>"
