abstract:
- content: "<p>An internally consistent procedure of uncertainty analysis will give
    the same results no matter how the calculations are legitimately rearranged. This
    paper identifies an apparent internal inconsistency arising with the full procedure
    described in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The phenomenon
    occurs when the measurand is expressible as a function of quantities with common
    sources, and is related to the calculation of an effective number of degrees of
    freedom. One common situation in which this inconsistency arises is where a point
    on a line is measured using estimates of the intercept and slope derived from
    the same dataset; the numbers of degrees of freedom obtained differ according
    to whether this point is measured directly from the dataset or from the estimates
    of the intercept and slope. An example is given where the widths of the corresponding
    expanded uncertainty intervals differ by a factor of approximately 2. Statistical
    principles explaining this issue are discussed, and a principle for the calculation
    of an effective number of degrees of freedom is proposed.</p>"
