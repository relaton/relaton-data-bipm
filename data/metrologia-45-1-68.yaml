  content: "<p>A cryogenic dual compensated calorimeter was constructed for energy
    loss measurements in superconducting materials. The losses induced by slowly varying
    periodic magnetic fields (amplitudes &lt;50 mT) in field-generating coils fabricated
    from different niobium wires were at the level of 500 nJ/cycle. Measurable losses
    are caused by incomplete Meissner effect in tested superconducting materials.
    The results of the study show the difficulties and limitations in the implementation
    of the kilogram standard using the ‘superconducting magnetic levitation mass’
    method.</p>"
