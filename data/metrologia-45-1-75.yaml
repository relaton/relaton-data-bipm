  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Melting/freezing curves are studied for the single-component Ga and
    bimetallic eutectic alloys Ga–In, Ga–Sn, Ga–Zn and Ga–Al in small-size cells.
    These phase-transition studies were conducted at VNIIOFI and SDL in order to design
    small-size fixed-point devices for metrological monitoring of temperature sensors
    on autonomous platforms. Our prime objective is to develop technology to improve
    the long-term performance of in-flight blackbody calibration sources of space-borne
    radiometers. The repeatability of the melting temperature of Ga and the eutectic
    melting temperatures of Ga–In, Ga–Sn and Ga–Zn fixed points were studied. Our
    results show that small cells containing Ga and some Ga-based eutectic alloys
    can be used as melting fixed-point standards.</p>"
