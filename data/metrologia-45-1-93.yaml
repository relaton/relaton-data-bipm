  content: "<p>Conventional Johnson noise thermometers based on switching correlators
    have conflicting matching requirements for the sensing resistance. To mitigate
    distortion effects in the correlator, the <italic>RT</italic> products of the
    two sensors must be the same, and to mitigate frequency-response errors in nominally
    identical input circuits, the two sensing resistances should be the same. A noise
    thermometer using synthetic noise for the primary reference signal overcomes this
    conflict because the output voltage and output resistance are independent. This
    paper presents the rationale and design constraints for a noise thermometer using
    a synthetic-noise source based on Josephson junctions. The quantized voltage noise
    source developed at NIST produces tunable waveforms with a spectral density composed
    of a comb of frequencies of equal amplitude and random phase. In addition to the
    conventional noise-power and impedance constraints, it has additional constraints
    relating to the number of tones and the tone spacing.</p>"
