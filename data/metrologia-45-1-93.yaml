abstract:
- content: "<p>Conventional Johnson noise thermometers based on switching correlators
    have conflicting matching requirements for the sensing resistance. To mitigate
    distortion effects in the correlator, the RT products of the two sensors must
    be the same, and to mitigate frequency-response errors in nominally identical
    input circuits, the two sensing resistances should be the same. A noise thermometer
    using synthetic noise for the primary reference signal overcomes this conflict
    because the output voltage and output resistance are independent. This paper presents
    the rationale and design constraints for a noise thermometer using a synthetic-noise
    source based on Josephson junctions. The quantized voltage noise source developed
    at NIST produces tunable waveforms with a spectral density composed of a comb
    of frequencies of equal amplitude and random phase. In addition to the conventional
    noise-power and impedance constraints, it has additional constraints relating
    to the number of tones and the tone spacing.</p>"
