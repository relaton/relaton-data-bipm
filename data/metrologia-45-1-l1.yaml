  content: "<p>Classically the non-parametric coverage interval is estimated by empirical
    quantiles. We introduce an alternative way for estimating the coverage interval
    by symmetric quantiles given by Chen and Chiang (1996 <italic>J. Nonparametric
    Stat.</italic> <bold>7</bold> 171–85). We further show that this alternative has
    a better precision in the sense that its asymptotic variances are smaller than
    the classical one.</p>"
