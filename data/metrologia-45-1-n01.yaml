abstract:
- content: "<p>Classically the non-parametric coverage interval is estimated by empirical
    quantiles. We introduce an alternative way for estimating the coverage interval
    by symmetric quantiles given by Chen and Chiang (1996 J. Nonparametric Stat. 7
    171–85). We further show that this alternative has a better precision in the sense
    that its asymptotic variances are smaller than the classical one.</p>"
