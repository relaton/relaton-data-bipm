    <p>This report describes the results obtained from a NIST–BIPM bilateral comparison of 1 Ω resistance standards in 2007. The comparison was carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.a. Three BIPM 1 Ω travelling standards of CSIRO type were calibrated first at the BIPM, then at the NIST and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability of the transfer standard was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer was significantly smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations. The NIST and the BIPM calibrations were found to be in good agreement, with a mean difference smaller than one standard uncertainty of the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
