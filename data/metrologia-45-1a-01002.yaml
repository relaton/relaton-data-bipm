    <p>A comparison of 100 pF capacitance standards at a measuring frequency of 1 kHz was carried out between the BIPM and the NML (Ireland). Two travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. Measurements were made over the period June to October 2007. One of the travelling standards had to be eliminated from the comparison due to a failure of its temperature control circuit. The transport characteristics of the remaining standard were satisfactory, and the results showed agreement well within the combined uncertainty of the comparison (relative expanded uncertainty 0.78 ppm, k = 2, 95% confidence).</p><p>Main text.
