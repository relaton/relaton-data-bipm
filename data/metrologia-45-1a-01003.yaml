abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of capacitance at 100 pF was conducted between thirteen participating laboratories from the Asia-Pacific region. Measurements were made over the period 2004 to 2006. The behaviour of the travelling artefact was consistent with a steady linear drift at a rate of less than 0.1 ÂµF/F per year. Despite the wide range of capabilities within the region, the results showed good agreement between all participating laboratories.</p><p>Main text.
