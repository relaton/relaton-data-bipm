    <p>A comparison between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Research Council (NRC) Josephson voltage standards (JVS) was carried out at the NRC from 13 August to 17 August 2007. The comparison was made at the 10 V level. It was a two-way direct JVS comparison, which means that the NIST JVS provided a voltage at 10 V and was measured against the NRC JVS with NRC's measuring system (hardware and software). The comparison was repeated by using the NIST JVS measuring system to measure a voltage at 10 V provided by the NRC JVS. The results from the two comparisons were consistent. The difference between the NIST CJVS and the NRC JVS is âˆ’0.28 nV with an expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of 2.07 nV at 10 V or 2.07 parts in 10<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>Main text.
