  content: "<p>As a part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K10.b, an on-site,
    direct comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science (KRISS), Republic of Korea, in February 2008.</p>\n<p>The
    final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the value
    assigned to the transportable 10 V BIPM Josephson Voltage Standard by the KRISS,
    at the KRISS, to the theoretical value assigned to the BIPM Josephson Voltage
    Standard: \n(<italic>U</italic><sub>KRISS</sub> −  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>)/<italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>
    = +1.7 × 10<sup>−10</sup> and \n <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub>/<italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>
    = 1.3 × 10<sup>−10</sup> \nwhere  <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> is the relative
    combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including
    the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM, the uncertainty
    of the representation of the volt at KRISS, both based on  <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub>,
    and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p>\n<p>The results are in very
    good agreement and show that the primary voltage standards maintained by the KRISS
    and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated expanded uncertainties.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
