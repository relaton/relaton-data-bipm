abstract:
- content: "<p>As a part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K10.b, an on-site,
    direct comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science (KRISS), Republic of Korea, in February 2008.</p><p>The
    final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the value
    assigned to the transportable 10 V BIPM Josephson Voltage Standard by the KRISS,
    at the KRISS, to the theoretical value assigned to the BIPM Josephson Voltage
    Standard: \n(U<sub>KRISS</sub> −  U<sub>BIPM</sub>)/U<sub>BIPM</sub> = +1.7 ×
    10<sup>−10</sup> and \n u<sub>c</sub>/U<sub>BIPM</sub> = 1.3 × 10<sup>−10</sup>
    \nwhere  u<sub>c</sub> is the relative combined standard uncertainty associated
    with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation
    of the volt at the BIPM, the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at
    KRISS, both based on  K<sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>The
    results are in very good agreement and show that the primary voltage standards
    maintained by the KRISS and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated expanded
    uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on
    \ Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
