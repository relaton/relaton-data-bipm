abstract:
- content: "<p>As a part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K11.a and b,
    a comparison of the 1.018 V and the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM
    and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon, Republic
    of Korea, was carried out in February 2008. One KRISS Zener diode (Fluke 732A)
    was used as a transfer standard. KRISS measurements were carried out by comparison
    with the KRISS primary voltage standard consisting of a Josephson Voltage Standard.
    BIPM measurements were carried out on site, at KRISS by comparison with the BIPM
    transportable Josephson Voltage Standard. The transfer standard wasn't characterized
    for the effects of temporal drift and environmental influences as both participants
    measured the Zener within a short time period. For day to day measurement, the
    voltage assigned by the BIPM to the transfer standard, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, was computed
    using a linear least-square fit to all of the data from the BIPM and referenced
    to the mean time of the KRISS measurements. The final result is the simple mean
    of the daily result over the total period of the comparison (6 days).</p><p>The
    final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the value
    assigned to a 1.018 V and 10 V standard by the KRISS, U<sub>KRISS</sub>, and that
    assigned by the BIPM, at the KRISS, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, which for the reference
    date is:</p><p>at 1.018 V, U<sub>KRISS</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = 70 nV; u<sub>c</sub>
    = 48 nV on 2008/02/26 \nat 10 V, U<sub>KRISS</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = −31 nV;
    u<sub>c</sub> = 100 nV on 2008/02/26,</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the standard
    uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty
    of the representation of the volt at the BIPM, the uncertainty of the representation
    of the volt at KRISS, both based on K<sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related
    to the comparison.</p><p>This satisfactory result shows that the voltage standards
    maintained by the KRISS and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated expanded
    uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach
    the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
