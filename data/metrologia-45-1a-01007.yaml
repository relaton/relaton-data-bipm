  content: "<p>As a part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K11.a and b,
    a comparison of the 1.018 V and the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM
    and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Daejeon, Republic
    of Korea, was carried out in February 2008. One KRISS Zener diode (Fluke 732A)
    was used as a transfer standard. KRISS measurements were carried out by comparison
    with the KRISS primary voltage standard consisting of a Josephson Voltage Standard.
    BIPM measurements were carried out on site, at KRISS by comparison with the BIPM
    transportable Josephson Voltage Standard. The transfer standard wasn't characterized
    for the effects of temporal drift and environmental influences as both participants
    measured the Zener within a short time period. For day to day measurement, the
    voltage assigned by the BIPM to the transfer standard,  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>,
    was computed using a linear least-square fit to all of the data from the BIPM
    and referenced to the mean time of the KRISS measurements. The final result is
    the simple mean of the daily result over the total period of the comparison (6
    days).</p>\n<p>The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference
    between the value assigned to a 1.018 V and 10 V standard by the KRISS,  <italic>U</italic><sub>KRISS</sub>,
    and that assigned by the BIPM, at the KRISS,  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>,
    which for the reference date is:</p>\n<p>at 1.018 V,  <italic>U</italic><sub>KRISS</sub>
    −  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = 70 nV;  <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub>
    = 48 nV on 2008/02/26 \nat 10 V,  <italic>U</italic><sub>KRISS</sub> −  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>
    = −31 nV;  <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 100 nV on 2008/02/26,</p>\n<p>where
    \ <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> is the standard uncertainty associated with the
    measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt
    at the BIPM, the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at KRISS, both
    based on  <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the
    comparison.</p>\n<p>This satisfactory result shows that the voltage standards
    maintained by the KRISS and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated expanded
    uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
