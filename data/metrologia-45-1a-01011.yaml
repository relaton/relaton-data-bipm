abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, was made with that of the Primarni Elektromagnetski Laboratorij (PEL), Croatia, in April 2007. The results are in very good agreement and the measured overall relative combined standard uncertainty is better than 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>Main text.
