    <p>The Spectral Radiance Comparison for the wavelength range from 220 nm to 2500 nm was initialized by CCPR in 1997 as a supplementary comparison with the identification CCPR-S1 and completed in 2008. Five NMIs took part in the comparison: BNM/INM (France), NIST (USA), NRC (Canada), PTB (Germany) and VNIIOFI (Russia). VNIIOFI was the pilot laboratory. Tungsten strip lamps were used as transfer standards. A star scheme was used with the sequence: Participant–Pilot–Participant. The report presents the descriptions of measuring facilities, procedures and uncertainties of all participants as well as the results of the comparison. The data sets were analysed in accordance with the Guidelines for CIPM Key Comparisons. Excluding a few wavelengths all participants agree with each other within ±1.5%. The disagreement decreases down to approximately ±1.0% when two unstable lamps are excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Main text.
