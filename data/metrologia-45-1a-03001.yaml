    <p>Comparisons of indium freezing point cells have been carried out by the EUROMET TC-THERM group as Projects Nos 391 and 712. The main objective was to establish the agreement between the realizations of the indium freezing point within different participating laboratories, to identify and eliminate possible discrepancies. The equipment has been made available by BNM–INM. Justervesenet coordinated project no 391, while project 712 was coordinated by BNM–INM. This paper is the final report of the results obtained, including the uncertainties in the comparisons and the degrees of equivalence between the laboratories.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EUROMET, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
