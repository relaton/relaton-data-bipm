    <p>Since 2005, the Institutul de Fizica si Inginerie Nucleara–"Horia Hulubei" (IFIN-HH) of Romania and the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) have each submitted samples of known activity of  <sup>133</sup>Ba to the International Reference System (SIR). The values of the activity submitted were about 1.4 MBq and 6.6 MBq. The IFIN result is their first contribution to the SIR for this radionuclide and for the NMIJ this key comparison result has replaced their earlier result dating from 1986. Each of these two new results has contributed to the updating of the KCRV for this radionuclide and is included in the matrix of degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database that now contains nine results for the comparison identified as BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133.</p>
