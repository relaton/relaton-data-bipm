abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the BEV, Austria and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the stated standard uncertainty when account is taken of the effect of the aperture support for the BIPM standard. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.
