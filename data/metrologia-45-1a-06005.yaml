- content: |-
    <p>A COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Cs-137 comparison of the measurement of a standardized solution of Cs-137 has enabled three national metrology institutes in the COOMET to demonstrate their traceability to the SI. The results of the comparison will be used to evaluate degrees of equivalence for these institutes through the measurements of the linking laboratory in the key comparison BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-137.</p><p>Main text.
