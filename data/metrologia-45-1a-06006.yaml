    <p>In 2006, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany submitted a sample of known activity of  <sup>186</sup>Re to the International Reference System (SIR). The value of the activity submitted was about 166 MBq. This comparison result is the first submission in the ongoing key comparison BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Re-186. The result agrees with that predicted from the efficiency curve for the SIR within a standard uncertainty.</p>
