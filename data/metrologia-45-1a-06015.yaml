    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NMIJ and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the expanded uncertainty, although there is evidence of a trend in the results for different radiation qualities. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
