abstract:
- content: "<p>This report summarizes the results of a regional key comparison (APMP-IC-2-97)
    under the aegis of\nAsia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) for pressure measurements
    in gas media and in gauge\nmode from 20 kPa to 105 kPa. The transfer standard
    was a pressure-balance with a piston–cylinder\nassembly with nominal effective
    area 335.7 mm<sup>2</sup> (TL-391) and was supplied by the National\nMetrology
    Institute of Japan [NMIJ]. Nine standards laboratories from the APMP region with
    one\nspecially invited laboratory from the EUROMET region, namely Physikalisch-Technische\nBundesanstalt
    (PTB), Germany, participated in this comparison. The comparison started in\nOctober
    1998 and was completed in May 2001. The pilot laboratory prepared the calibration\nprocedure
    as per the guidelines of APMP and International Bureau of Weights and Measures\n(BIPM)
    [1–4]. Detailed instructions for performing this key comparison were provided
    in the\ncalibration protocol and the required data were described in: (1) Annex
    3 – characteristics of the\nlaboratory standards, (2) Annex 4 – the effective
    area \n(A′<sub>p′</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>) (where \nthe prime indicates values based
    on measured quantities) at 23 °C of the travelling standard\nas a function of
    nominal pressure (p′/kPa) (five cycles both increasing and decreasing pressures
    at\nfive predetermined pressure points) and (3) Annex 5 – the average effective
    area at \n23 °C (A′<sub>p′</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>)\nobtained for each pressure p′/kPa
    with all uncertainty statements. The pilot laboratory processed\nthe information
    and the data provided by the participants for these three annexes, starting with
    the\ninformation about the standards as provided in Annex 3. Based on this information,
    the participating\nlaboratories are classified into two categories: (I) laboratories
    that are maintaining primary standards,\nand (II) laboratories that are maintaining
    standards loosely classified as secondary standards with a\nclear traceability
    from other established national metrology institutes (NMI) as per norm of the\nBIPM.
    It is observed that out of these ten laboratories, six laboratories have primary
    standards\n[Category (I)]; the remaining four laboratories are placed in Category
    (II).</p><p>During the process of comparison, there was a loss of mass of the
    piston TL-391 by an amount of\nroughly 23.4 mg in two instances, originally noticed
    at NMIJ and then at NMISA within the first\nyear of circulation. Unfortunately,
    we do not have any information where it had happened and when.\nBut after that,
    there was no change of mass of the piston for nearly two years till the end of
    this\ncomparison. NMIJ reported that it happened due to the damage of the pin
    attached to the piston.\nInterestingly, loss of mass of the piston by an amount
    of 7.6 mg was reported in the transit from\nNMIJ to NMISA and within one month.
    Since the damage and subsequent loss of mass occurs\ninstantaneously, we believe
    that the first damage had happened close to NMIJ and the second at NMISA\nwhere
    the necessary corrections have been already made. Therefore, we have not introduced
    any\ncorrection to any datum provided by the participating laboratories in both
    the phase A and phase B loops.</p><p>The obtained data were compiled and processed
    under the same program as per the\nConsultative Committee for Mass and Related
    Quantities (CCM)/BIPM guidelines [5]. Following the\napproach of Elster et al
    [6], we have evaluated these results and establish a link with CCM.P-K6\nthrough
    the link laboratory PTB (Germany). From the CCM.P-K6 key comparison reference
    value\n(KCRV), we have estimated the relative deviation of \n A′<sub>0</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>
    from the reference value for all ten\nlaboratories and compared this with their
    estimated expanded uncertainties at k = 2. The bilateral\ndegree of equivalence
    of the participating laboratories in the APMP.M.P-K6 comparison has been\nestimated
    from the degree of equivalence between two laboratories. These results show an
    excellent\nagreement of all participating laboratories within the estimated expanded
    uncertainties using a\ncoverage factor k = 2.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
