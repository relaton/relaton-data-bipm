  content: "<p>This report summarizes the results of a regional key comparison (APMP-IC-2-97)
    under the aegis of\nAsia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) for pressure measurements
    in gas media and in gauge\nmode from 20 kPa to 105 kPa. The transfer standard
    was a pressure-balance with a piston–cylinder\nassembly with nominal effective
    area 335.7 mm<sup>2</sup> (TL-391) and was supplied by the National\nMetrology
    Institute of Japan [NMIJ]. Nine standards laboratories from the APMP region with
    one\nspecially invited laboratory from the EUROMET region, namely Physikalisch-Technische\nBundesanstalt
    (PTB), Germany, participated in this comparison. The comparison started in\nOctober
    1998 and was completed in May 2001. The pilot laboratory prepared the calibration\nprocedure
    as per the guidelines of APMP and International Bureau of Weights and Measures\n(BIPM)
    [1–4]. Detailed instructions for performing this key comparison were provided
    in the\ncalibration protocol and the required data were described in: (1) Annex
    3 – characteristics of the\nlaboratory standards, (2) Annex 4 – the effective
    area \n(<italic>A</italic>′<sub><italic>p</italic>′</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>) (where
    \nthe prime indicates values based on measured quantities) at 23 °C of the travelling
    standard\nas a function of nominal pressure (<italic>p</italic>′/kPa) (five cycles
    both increasing and decreasing pressures at\nfive predetermined pressure points)
    and (3) Annex 5 – the average effective area at \n23 °C (<italic>A</italic>′<sub><italic>p</italic>′</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup>)\nobtained
    for each pressure  <italic>p</italic>′/kPa with all uncertainty statements. The
    pilot laboratory processed\nthe information and the data provided by the participants
    for these three annexes, starting with the\ninformation about the standards as
    provided in Annex 3. Based on this information, the participating\nlaboratories
    are classified into two categories: (I) laboratories that are maintaining primary
    standards,\nand (II) laboratories that are maintaining standards loosely classified
    as secondary standards with a\nclear traceability from other established national
    metrology institutes (NMI) as per norm of the\nBIPM. It is observed that out of
    these ten laboratories, six laboratories have primary standards\n[Category (I)];
    the remaining four laboratories are placed in Category (II).</p>\n<p>During the
    process of comparison, there was a loss of mass of the piston TL-391 by an amount
    of\nroughly 23.4 mg in two instances, originally noticed at NMIJ and then at NMISA
    within the first\nyear of circulation. Unfortunately, we do not have any information
    where it had happened and when.\nBut after that, there was no change of mass of
    the piston for nearly two years till the end of this\ncomparison. NMIJ reported
    that it happened due to the damage of the pin attached to the piston.\nInterestingly,
    loss of mass of the piston by an amount of 7.6 mg was reported in the transit
    from\nNMIJ to NMISA and within one month. Since the damage and subsequent loss
    of mass occurs\ninstantaneously, we believe that the first damage had happened
    close to NMIJ and the second at NMISA\nwhere the necessary corrections have been
    already made. Therefore, we have not introduced any\ncorrection to any datum provided
    by the participating laboratories in both the phase A and phase B loops.</p>\n<p>The
    obtained data were compiled and processed under the same program as per the\nConsultative
    Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM)/BIPM guidelines [5]. Following
    the\napproach of Elster  <italic>et al</italic> [6], we have evaluated these results
    and establish a link with CCM.P-K6\nthrough the link laboratory PTB (Germany).
    From the CCM.P-K6 key comparison reference value\n(KCRV), we have estimated the
    relative deviation of \n <italic>A</italic>′<sub>0</sub>/mm<sup>2</sup> from the
    reference value for all ten\nlaboratories and compared this with their estimated
    expanded uncertainties at  <italic>k</italic> = 2. The bilateral\ndegree of equivalence
    of the participating laboratories in the APMP.M.P-K6 comparison has been\nestimated
    from the degree of equivalence between two laboratories. These results show an
    excellent\nagreement of all participating laboratories within the estimated expanded
    uncertainties using a\ncoverage factor  <italic>k</italic> = 2.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
