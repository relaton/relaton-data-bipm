- content: |-
    <p>The results are presented of key comparison CCM.P-K2 that covered the pressure range 10 kPa to 120 kPa in absolute mode. Nine national measurement institutes participated in the comparison, which used a piston–cylinder assembly of 335 mm<sup>2</sup> nominal effective area as a transfer standard.</p><p>Whilst not all laboratories were found to be equivalent at all pressures, the larger-than-expected instabilities in the transfer standard precluded the ability to discriminate between participants' standards at a level needed to fully support the Calibration Measurement Capabilities table in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this Paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
