    <p>The results are presented of key comparison CCM.P-K2 that covered the pressure range 10 kPa to 120 kPa in absolute mode. Nine national measurement institutes participated in the comparison, which used a piston–cylinder assembly of 335 mm<sup>2</sup> nominal effective area as a transfer standard.</p>
    <p>Whilst not all laboratories were found to be equivalent at all pressures, the larger-than-expected instabilities in the transfer standard precluded the ability to discriminate between participants' standards at a level needed to fully support the Calibration Measurement Capabilities table in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
