    <p>LNE and BIPM compared their pressure standards equipped with 20 cm<sup>2</sup> effective area piston–cylinder units in the absolute pressure range from 80 kPa to 110 kPa.</p><p>The pressure standards, the method for calculating the reference values and the comparison results are presented. The results of the comparison can be considered as satisfactory as the deviations from the reference value are inside the estimated combined uncertainty.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EUROMET, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
