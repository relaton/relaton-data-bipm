    <p>The EUROMET project No 861 is organised using the same procedures as for the CCM.P-K1.b key comparison, in the pressure range 0.04 MPa to 1.75 MPa. LNE participated in the CCM.P-K1.b comparison as co-pilot. Key pressure points 100 kPa, 500 kPa and 1 MPa have been selected in the present comparison in order to allow a link to the CCM one.</p>
    <p>A pressure balance equipped with a piston–cylinder of 200 mm<sup>2</sup> effective area is compared to the pressure standards of each participating institute in the range 0.04 MPa to 1.75 MPa. From these measurements, the effective area at null pressure of the assembly is calculated. The results are compared to those obtained in the CCM.P-K1.b comparison.</p>
