    <p>This report summarizes the results of a EUROMET comparison of 1 kg mass standards carried out between 25 laboratories. The transfer standards comprised four stainless steel 1 kg weights, two of which were circulated in each of two separate loops. The majority of the results of the participants are consistent both with each other and with the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of comparison CCM.M-K1 to which this comparison has been linked</p><p>Main text.
