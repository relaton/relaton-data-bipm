- content: |-
    <p>This report summarizes the results of bilateral comparison of two 1 kg stainless steel mass standards between DFM, Denmark, and MIRS, Slovenia. The objectives were to facilitate the demonstration of metrological equivalence between the two participating national laboratories and to check the capabilities of MIRS to improve quoted calibration measurement capabilities (CMC) at 1 kg.</p><p>Both laboratories have participated in EUROMET project 510 (key comparison EUROMET.M.M-K4). Results are consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value of the comparison CCM.M-K1 to which this comparison has been linked through the comparison EUROMET.M.M-K4.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
