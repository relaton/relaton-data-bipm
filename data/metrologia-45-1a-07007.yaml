    <p>This report summarizes the results of bilateral comparison of two 1 kg stainless steel mass standards between DFM, Denmark, and MIRS, Slovenia. The objectives were to facilitate the demonstration of metrological equivalence between the two participating national laboratories and to check the capabilities of MIRS to improve quoted calibration measurement capabilities (CMC) at 1 kg.</p>
    <p>Both laboratories have participated in EUROMET project 510 (key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/45/1A/07006/">EUROMET.M.M-K4</ext-link>). Results are consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value of the comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/41/1A/07002/">CCM.M-K1</ext-link> to which this comparison has been linked through the comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/45/1A/07006/">EUROMET.M.M-K4</ext-link>.</p>
