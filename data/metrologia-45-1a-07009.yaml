    <p>This article describes the results of the first COOMET key comparison in which four national metrology institutes (NMIs) took part. Three samples of Newtonian liquids with nominal kinematic viscosities of 30 mm<sup>2</sup>/s, 100 mm<sup>2</sup>/s and 1000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at 20 °C were used to determine the degrees of equivalence of the national standards of Belarus, Ukraine and Bulgaria to the standards of NMIs that took part in the KC CIPM (CCM.V-K1).</p>
    <p>The results of the evaluation of data obtained for all liquids used in the comparison were compared with the reference values (KCRV), obtained in the first key comparison CIPM (CCM.V-K1).</p>
