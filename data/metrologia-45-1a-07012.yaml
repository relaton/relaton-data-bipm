    <p>This report describes the results from the intercomparison of low flow gas facilities at eleven European laboratories. The organizations taking part were TUV NEL (UK), EIM (Greece), NMi (The Netherlands), CMI (The Czech Republic), INRIM (Italy), MIKES (Finland), METAS (Switzerland), PTB (Germany), LNE (France), FI (Denmark) and UME (Turkey). EIM acted as joint pilot laboratory with TUVNEL and NMi acted as assisting laboratory.</p>
    <p>The transfer package consisted of two high-accuracy laminar-flow elements with associated hardware and software. The laminar-flow elements were Molblocs manufactured by DH Instruments Inc. The two Molblocs covered different flow ranges and were calibrated separately. The flow ranges covered were 2.1 mg/s to 21 mg/s for Molbloc A and 83 mg/s to 578 mg/s for Molbloc B.</p>
