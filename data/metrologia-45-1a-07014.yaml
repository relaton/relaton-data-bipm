    <p>This document describes the method used to link the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/45/1A/07013">EUROMET.M.P-K4</ext-link> and  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/42/1A/07005">CCM.P-K7</ext-link> Key Comparisons. The linking has been established by means of the laboratories taking part in both the EUROMET.M.P-K4 and CCM.P-K7 Key Comparisons. These comparisons may be readily compared as the type of transfer standard and the corresponding nominal pressures were the same.</p>
