    <p>This document describes the method used to link the  EUROMET.M.P-K4 and  CCM.P-K7 Key Comparisons. The linking has been established by means of the laboratories taking part in both the EUROMET.M.P-K4 and CCM.P-K7 Key Comparisons. These comparisons may be readily compared as the type of transfer standard and the corresponding nominal pressures were the same.</p><p>Main text.
