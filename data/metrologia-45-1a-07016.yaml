    <p>This report summarizes the results of a comparison of mass standards conducted between fourteen participating members of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Program. Two sets of weights with five nominal mass values: 1 kg, 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg (OIML Class E<sub>2</sub>) were used as travelling artifacts.  These nominal values were chosen as they followed the nominal values of  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/41/1A/07002">CCM.M-K1</ext-link> and  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/07004">CCM.M-K2</ext-link> except for the 10 kg. The program was sponsored by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and Vietnam Metrology Institute. VMI was the coordinating laboratory with National Measurement Institute, Australia (NMIA) being a technical assisting laboratory as well as a link laboratory to the CCM comparisons. The comparison was carried out from May 2005 to November 2006.</p>
