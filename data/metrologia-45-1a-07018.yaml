    <p>COOMET project no 219/SK-a/00 'Performance of comparison measurements of testing standard equipment working in the gas flowrate range: (A) 0.06 m<sup>3</sup>/h to 10 m<sup>3</sup>/h; (B) 100 m<sup>3</sup>/h to 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/h', ref. no COOMET.M.FF-S1 has been organized by TC 1.4 'Flow measurement' of COOMET, started in March 2006 and finished in October 2008.</p>
    <p>Type of comparison – supplementary; Pilot laboratory – SMU, Slovak Institute of Metrology.
    Participating institutes (and countries): SMU, Slovakia; PTB, Germany; LEI, Lithuania; BelGIM, Belarus; FGUP VNIIR, Russia; SE 'Ivano-Frankovskstandartmetrology', Ukraine; NISM, Moldavia.</p>
    <p>The comparison was realized at two levels.</p>
    <p>Within the first level (A*), the comparisons of the test rigs were realized for verification of the diaphragm domestic gas meters in the flow range of 0.12 m<sup>3</sup>/h to 10 m<sup>3</sup>/h. The compared measurement means were the set of five diaphragm gas meters of type MKM, size G6. Two laboratories (SMU Bratislava, Slovakia and LEI Kaunas, Lithuania) of the seven participating laboratories at this level are participants in projects of comparisons, which are organized within the regional metrological organization EUROMET.</p>
    <p>The second level (B*) assured a comparison measurement of testing devices for industry gas meters of flow range from 100 m<sup>3</sup>/h to 1000 m<sup>3</sup>/h. The comparison meter was an axial turbine gas meter of DAE type, G650 size serial number 0004455/2005. Seven laboratories participated at this level of the project, including the laboratory of Belarus with a limited flow rate range (from 100 m<sup>3</sup>/h to 400 m<sup>3</sup>/h). Three laboratories (PTB Braunschweig, Germany; SMU Bratislava, Slovakia and LEI Kaunas, Lithuania) of the seven participating laboratories at this level are participants of comparisons, which are organized within the regional metrological organization EUROMET; out of that group the laboratory PTB Braunschweig, Germany is also participant in a CIPM key comparison.</p>
    <p>Based on the given results, one can say that the first comparison in this field within the COOMET regional organization achieved good results.</p>
