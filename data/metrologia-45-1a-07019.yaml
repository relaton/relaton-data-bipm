    <p>This international key comparison was carried out in the field of liquid hydrocarbon flow.  The intercomparison initially involved nine laboratories each designated as national standard calibration laboratories.  The comparison was carried out using the BIPM guidelines for key comparisons and is included in the BIPM database to support the capability statements of the institutes as part of the MRA.  The intercomparison was designated as being comparison CCM-FF-K2 by WGFF.</p>
    <p>The key comparison was carried out using light liquid hydrocarbon across a flow range 5 l/s to 30 l/s.  Two meters, a Kral positive displacement meter and a turbine meter, were used in the intercomparison package; however, the primary comparison used the Kral positive displacement meter.  Strouhal and Reynolds numbers were used as the key parameters to express the laboratories' (dynamic) measurement of volume and flowrate.</p>
    <p>Six laboratories finally provided results to allow the calculation of a KCRV (based on Strouhal number), and all six sets of results were consistent with the KCRV.  The deviations from the KCRV using the Kral meter lay within a band of ±0.026%.</p>
