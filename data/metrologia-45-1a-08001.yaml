- content: |-
    <p>The CCQM-K30 key comparison was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of the CCQM to test the capabilities of national metrological institutes (NMIs) to measure the lead content of wine at the ~3 ng/g level. LGC designed and coordinated the study with the samples being prepared and distributed by Fundacion Chile. Eleven NMIs participated in the key comparison, nine of whom used isotope dilution, one used ICP-MS with external calibration and another used GF-AAS with external calibration. The two laboratories who did not use IDMS, subsequently reported technical difficulties and were therefore not used in the calculation of the KCRV. The agreement among the laboratories using IDMS was excellent as evidenced by the small values for both the equivalence statements (D<sub>i</sub> &lt; 0.2 ng/g) and the associated uncertainties (u<sub>i</sub> &lt; 0.3 ng/g).</p><p>A pilot study (P12.1) was performed concurrently with the same sample used in CCQM-K30 by laboratories preferring to participate in the pilot study. The pilot study also included the additional analytes: iron, copper and cadmium. The results of the pilot study are reported separately.</p><p>Main text.
