abstract:
- content: "<p>The aim of this comparison was to compare capabilities for the preparation
    and value assignment of gas mixture standards for sulphur dioxide in air (or nitrogen),
    maintained at national metrology institutes (NMIs).  The measurements in this
    key comparison took place in 2006. There were three participants and one coordinating
    laboratory. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) was based on the gravimetric
    preparation for all components. The range of the nominal amount-of-substance fractions
    of the comparison standard is 90 µmol/mol to 100 µmol/mol.  The Chemical Evaluation
    Research Institute (CERI, Japan) prepared gravimetric mixture samples of sulfur
    dioxide in nitrogen in 10 L aluminium cylinders with a passivated inner surface.
    The homogeneity and long term stability of these samples were evaluated at CERI
    before and after the shipment of the cylinders to the participants. The uncertainty
    of the standard gases including the long term stability was estimated to be 0.1
    %. Each participating laboratory was shipped one cylinder to be analyzed and then
    returned to the CERI. Three participants submitted results that were within 0.6%
    of the relevant reference value. In these cases, the estimated uncertainties were
    larger than the deviation from the reference value. The agreement of the results
    in this key comparison is good. CERI is the link laboratory between CCQM-K1.d
    and   APMP.QM-K4.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click
