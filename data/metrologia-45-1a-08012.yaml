    <p>The CCQM key comparison K42 was organized by the inorganic analysis working group of CCQM to test the abilities of metrological institutes to measure the mass fractions of the components of an aluminium alloy. Chosen elements were chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). The BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM Bundesanstalt f체r Materialforschung und -pr체fung) in Berlin, Germany acted as the pilot laboratory. CCQM-K42 demonstrates the abilities of metrological institutes to measure the mass fractions of minor and trace components (mass content about 0.05% to 0.2%) of an aluminium alloy for chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). The analytical methods used were neutron activation analysis (NAA), x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) using the reconstitution technique, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. The scope of the key comparison extends to non-ferrous alloys comprising the same or similar constituents when analysed using the technique(s) applied by a participant in obtaining the results submitted for CCQM-K42.</p>
