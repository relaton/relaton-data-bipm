    <p>The subsequent key comparison CCQM-K18.1 was started in order to evaluate the equivalence of metrology institutes as a follow-up to the previous key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/44/1A/08011">CCQM-K18</ext-link> for institutes that could not take part in the comparison at that time or did not consider their results representative of their capabilities. A carbonate buffer of a slightly different composition to that in CCQM-K18 was used.</p>
    <p>There were seven institutes plus the coordinating laboratory participating in this subsequent comparison. Most of the participating institutes showed significant improvement; in some cases the new results confirmed the previous ones. The reasons for this have still to be elucidated. </p>
