abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The subsequent key comparison CCQM-K18.1 was started in order to evaluate the equivalence of metrology institutes as a follow-up to the previous key comparison  CCQM-K18 for institutes that could not take part in the comparison at that time or did not consider their results representative of their capabilities. A carbonate buffer of a slightly different composition to that in CCQM-K18 was used.</p><p>There were seven institutes plus the coordinating laboratory participating in this subsequent comparison. Most of the participating institutes showed significant improvement; in some cases the new results confirmed the previous ones. The reasons for this have still to be elucidated.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
