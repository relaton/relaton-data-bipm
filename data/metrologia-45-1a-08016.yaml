abstract:
- content: "<p>A key comparison (CCQM-K49) of the determination of toxic and essential
    elements in bovine liver has been conducted under the auspices of the CCQM Inorganic
    Analysis Working Group (IAWG). All elements were present at naturally occurring
    levels, and in naturally occurring (non-spiked) forms in this material. Sixteen
    national metrology institutes (NMIs) submitted data for this study using a variety
    of analytical methods.</p><p>Measurands for this study consisted of elements that
    were expected to be relatively easy to determine (Fe and Zn), moderately difficult
    to determine (Se, Cd and Pb), and very difficult to determine (Cr and As). The
    results of this comparison seem to bear these rankings out, with the possible
    exception that Se was more difficult to determine than Cd and Pb, perhaps due
    to the difference in the amount of experience for many NMIs with this element
    compared to Cd and Pb. However, Se seemed to be less difficult to determine than
    Cr and As based on the dispersion of the reported data and the typical expanded
    uncertainties reported by the NMIs.</p><p>Results for this key comparison are
    highly encouraging in that all reported values, with only three exceptions, agreed
    within stated (expanded) uncertainties with the key comparison reference values
    (KCRVs), or were within an additional 1% of the KCRV. Since this key comparison
    included 60 separate determinations of the studied constituents, 95% of the results
    could be considered successful.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
