abstract:
- content: "<p>It is recommended in the internationally adopted standard GUM that
    the measurement result of a measurand Y, determined from input quantities through
    a known functional relationship, should be reported as an uncertainty interval
    with a specific level of confidence. The uncertainty intervals discussed in GUM
    are evaluated by assuming that the measurements of Y follow a normal or t distribution.
    However, in practice, the resulting measurements of Y tend to follow an asymmetric
    distribution. This communication reviews some generalized univariate distributions
    that can be fitted to the measurements of Y based on its shape in terms of its
    coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. The uncertainty interval of the measurand
    is then evaluated from the fitted distribution. Examples are given to illustrate
    the use of these distributions in evaluating the expanded uncertainty in measurement.</p>"
