abstract:
- content: "<p>A method for calibrating indicating instruments that exploits the combinatorial
    properties of a set of different-valued, and mostly uncalibrated, artefacts is
    described. The paper presents the underlying principles of the method, its limitations,
    and examples of the application of the method to mass balances, optical detectors
    and resistance bridges. The method is applicable to indicating instruments that
    measure rational quantities and for which it is possible to combine artefacts
    with negligible error. For direct-reading instruments, at least one of the artefacts
    should be calibrated. For ratio-indicating instruments, none of the artefacts
    need be calibrated. It is shown that for artefacts that can be combined linearly,
    a binary sequence generally comes close to maximizing the number of combinations
    available.</p>"
