  content: "<p>Possible changes to the International System of Units (SI) are being
    discussed, including a proposal to define the units by specifying the values of
    a set of fundamental constants. This note is an elementary guide to the algebra
    associated with unit exponents which can be used both to display the relationships
    between different sets of units and to provide simple tests of whether a particular
    set of constants provides combinations of units that form a complete set.</p>"
