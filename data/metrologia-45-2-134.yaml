  content: "<p>‘Quantity calculus’ is a name sometimes given to algebra as it is applied
    to quantities. It is assumed that the rules of algebra apply equally well to quantities
    as they do to numbers, and that they apply to units of measurement because they
    too are, by definition, quantities in their own right. This paper examines that
    assumption and concludes that, while it may be true of abstract quantities, it
    is not universally applicable to measurable quantities, whose practical units
    are not algebraic variables.</p>"
