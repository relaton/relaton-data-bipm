abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements of air density determined gravimetrically and by using
    the CIPM-81/91 formula, an equation of state, have a relative deviation of 6.4
    × 10<sup>−5</sup>.</p><p>This difference is consistent with a new determination
    of the mole fraction of argon x<sub>Ar</sub> carried out in 2002 by the Korea
    Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and with recently published
    results from the LNE. The CIPM equation is based on the molar mass of dry air,
    which is dependent on the contents of the atmospheric gases, including the concentration
    of argon. We accept the new argon value as definitive and amend the CIPM-81/91
    formula accordingly. The KRISS results also provide a test of certain assumptions
    concerning the mole fractions of oxygen and carbon dioxide in air. An updated
    value of the molar gas constant R is available and has been incorporated in the
    CIPM-2007 equation. In making these changes, we have also calculated the uncertainty
    of the CIPM-2007 equation itself in conformance with the Guide to the Expression
    of Uncertainty in Measurement, which was not the case for previous versions of
    this equation. The 96th CIPM meeting has accepted these changes.</p>"
