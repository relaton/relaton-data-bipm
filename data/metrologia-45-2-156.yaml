  content: "<p>The performance of carrier-phase based GPS precision time transfer
    was investigated by conducting a 7-month campaign of time transfer among four
    national timing laboratories. The Common-View and the All-in-View techniques,
    which are two typical techniques for the GPS carrier-phase time transfer, are
    examined in terms of time transfer and frequency transfer together with other
    independent time transfer systems such as TWSTFT. Comparison of clock estimates
    with BIPM <italic>Circular-T</italic> was performed and the modified Allan deviation
    of clock estimates was calculated to assess the relative frequency instability
    as a measure of frequency transfer performance. Also an issue of baseline limitation
    for the carrier-phase Common-View methods has been investigated by conducting
    a 1-month GPS time transfer to a set of IGS stations with different baselines.
    Finally, the potential of the GPS carrier-phase time transfer as a real-time synchronization
    method was assessed by carrying out the GPS time transfer with the IGS Ultra-rapid
    orbits.</p>"
