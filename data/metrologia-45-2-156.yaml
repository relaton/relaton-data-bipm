abstract:
- content: "<p>The performance of carrier-phase based GPS precision time transfer
    was investigated by conducting a 7-month campaign of time transfer among four
    national timing laboratories. The Common-View and the All-in-View techniques,
    which are two typical techniques for the GPS carrier-phase time transfer, are
    examined in terms of time transfer and frequency transfer together with other
    independent time transfer systems such as TWSTFT. Comparison of clock estimates
    with BIPM Circular-T was performed and the modified Allan deviation of clock estimates
    was calculated to assess the relative frequency instability as a measure of frequency
    transfer performance. Also an issue of baseline limitation for the carrier-phase
    Common-View methods has been investigated by conducting a 1-month GPS time transfer
    to a set of IGS stations with different baselines. Finally, the potential of the
    GPS carrier-phase time transfer as a real-time synchronization method was assessed
    by carrying out the GPS time transfer with the IGS Ultra-rapid orbits.</p>"
