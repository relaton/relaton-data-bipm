abstract:
- content: "<p>The positioning error of an acoustic transducer may become a relevant
    source of uncertainty in some circumstances, especially in the high frequency
    range. The issue of quantifying this uncertainty is still far from being resolved,
    though some efforts have been made.</p><p>This paper studies positional uncertainty
    based on the concept of an uncertainty sphere. A general characterization of positional
    errors is introduced and the sound pressure uncertainty is calculated for two
    basic calibration scenarios where an analytical formula exists.</p><p>The results
    show that the influence of positional uncertainty cannot be neglected. Even in
    the low-frequency-range (&lt;3 kHz), it may give rise to a slight deviation that
    could be considered noticeable for calibration purposes. At high frequencies the
    consequences become dramatic, showing deviations that can exceed 5 dB for non-frontal
    incidence. A strong dependence is found between the output uncertainty and the
    source directivity pattern.</p><p>For cases where an analytical solution is not
    available, the contribution to uncertainty can be calculated via Monte Carlo simulations.
    A validation and convergence study of this application of the Monte Carlo method
    (MCM) is presented. The results show that the method is suitable for a great variety
    of practical scenarios.</p>"
