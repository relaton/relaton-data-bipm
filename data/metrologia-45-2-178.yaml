  content: "<p>It is recommended in the internationally adopted standard GUM that
    the measurement result of a measurand <italic>Y</italic>, determined from input
    quantities through a known functional relationship, should be reported as an uncertainty
    interval with a specific level of confidence. The uncertainty intervals discussed
    in GUM are evaluated by assuming that the measurements of <italic>Y</italic> follow
    a normal or <italic>t</italic> distribution. However, in practice, the resulting
    measurements of <italic>Y</italic> tend to follow an asymmetric distribution.
    This communication reviews some generalized univariate distributions that can
    be fitted to the measurements of <italic>Y</italic> based on its shape in terms
    of its coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. The uncertainty interval of the
    measurand is then evaluated from the fitted distribution. Examples are given to
    illustrate the use of these distributions in evaluating the expanded uncertainty
    in measurement.</p>"
