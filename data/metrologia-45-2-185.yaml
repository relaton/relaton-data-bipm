abstract:
- content: "<p>Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) has become an
    important technical component in the process of the realization of International
    Atomic Time. To employ the full potential of the technique, especially for true
    time transfer, a dedicated calibration is necessary. This consists of the calibration
    either of the operational link at large, including every component involved, or
    of the involved ground stations' internal delays only. Both modes were successfully
    employed by circulating and operating a portable reference station between the
    sites involved. In this paper, we summarize the theoretical background for the
    different calibration modes applied and report examples of results from the 13
    calibration campaigns performed up to now in Europe and between Europe and the
    United States. In all of these exercises, estimated uncertainties around 1â€‰ns
    were achieved. Consecutive campaigns showed a very good reproducibility at the
    nanosecond level. Additionally, we address and briefly discuss sources that possibly
    limit the uncertainty for true time transfer employing TWSTFT.</p>"
