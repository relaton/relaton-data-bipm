abstract:
- content: "<p>The analysis of key comparison data is at the focus of metrology-related
    research and many papers have been published on this issue in recent years. Typically,
    the approaches make use of quoted combined uncertainties. We propose an approach
    which is based on more detailed uncertainty information. We assume that each of
    the participating laboratories has knowledge about the precision of its measurements
    and, in addition, provides a probability density function (PDF) which encodes
    its assessment on the size of its bias. Only the case of a single stable travelling
    standard is considered.</p><p>The analysis starts with a consistency test of the
    data and the PDFs provided by the participating laboratories. If this test is
    passed, a probabilistic approach based on a bias model is applied in order to
    merge the information of all participants. PDFs for the value of the travelling
    standard and, in particular, for the biases of the participating laboratories
    are derived. Explicit results are given for Gaussian PDFs. It is shown that the
    proposed use of detailed uncertainty information results in improved estimates
    of the biases. In particular for those laboratories expecting to have a large
    bias, the uncertainty about their biases can thereby be reduced significantly.</p>"
