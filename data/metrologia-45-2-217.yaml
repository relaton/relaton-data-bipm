abstract:
- content: "<p>With the relentless quest for improved performance driving ever tighter
    tolerances for manufacturing, machine tools are sometimes unable to meet the desired
    requirements. One option to improve the tolerances of machine tools is to compensate
    for their errors. Among all possible sources of machine tool error, thermally
    induced errors are, in general for newer machines, the most important. The present
    work demonstrates the evaluation and modelling of the behaviour of the thermal
    errors of a CNC cylindrical grinding machine during its warm-up period.</p>"
