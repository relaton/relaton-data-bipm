  content: "<p>A generalized formalism is presented for linking a Comit√© International
    de Poids et Mesures (CIPM) key comparison (KC) with similar regional KCs. The
    mechanism proposed provides a straightforward and practical means for reporting
    on the equivalence of the larger ensemble of national metrology institutes resulting
    from the linking of a regional metrology organization KC to the CIPM KC of the
    same measurand. Redundancy in the linking path which results when there is more
    than one linking lab is exploited for testing the statistical consistency of the
    linking relative to the claimed uncertainties. The proposed linking procedure
    is described and illustrated with a real-world practical example employing extended
    chi-squared-like statistics. A procedure for linking in the presence of artefact
    drift or other parametrized corrections is outlined.</p>"
