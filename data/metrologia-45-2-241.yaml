abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents, entirely within the scope of the GUM Supplement
    1, a rigorous treatment of the comparison loss in the microwave power meter calibration
    problem. The treatment is made for especially selected cases with feasible uncertainty
    values for the instruments. The resulting modelling function, without any simplification,
    is treated with the GUM Supplement 1 proposed propagation of distributions approach
    and with the law of propagation of uncertainties approach. Monte Carlo simulations
    (MCSs), performed with one billion trials, make possible a precise determination
    of the output statistical values. As expected for actual physical problems, output
    PDFs are continuous for all cases with meaningful physical parameters. Results
    show that the estimates provided by the law of propagation of uncertainties are
    shifted by a positive amount in relation to the estimates provided by MCS. The
    standard uncertainty values obtained with the law of propagation of uncertainties
    with terms up to second order are coincident with the values provided by MCS within
    3 parts in 10<sup>5</sup>. The law of distribution of uncertainties is not validated
    for the treatment of this problem.</p>"
