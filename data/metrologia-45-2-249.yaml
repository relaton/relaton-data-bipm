  content: "<p>The effect of natural convection on the uncertainty calculation of
    the MIKES dynamic gravimetric gas mass flow measurement system (DWS) is studied
    in this paper. The magnitude of the uncertainty component due to varying shear
    stress rate at the wall of the cylinder is studied theoretically at two different
    varying temperature models. Based on the obtained results, the contribution of
    the component may be significant, if the temperature difference between the wall
    of a gas cylinder and ambient air increases 1 K during one measurement cycle.
    Then the contribution of the shear stress can be above 92% of the combined standard
    uncertainty at the gas mass flow rate 0.1 mg s<sup>−1</sup>. Correspondingly,
    the contribution at the same temperature difference is below 1% at the mass flow
    rate 625 mg s<sup>−1</sup>. Applying the Monte Carlo uncertainty estimation method,
    the assumption of independent variables was shown to be reasonable.</p>"
