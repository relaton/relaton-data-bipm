  content: "<p>This communication demonstrates the need for independent validation
    when an uncertainty calculation procedure is applied to a particular type of measurement
    problem. A simple measurement scenario is used to highlight differences in the
    performance of two general methods of uncertainty calculation, one from the <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (GUM) and one from <italic>Supplement
    1 to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’—Propagation of
    Distributions using a Monte Carlo method</italic>. The performance of these methods
    is investigated in terms of the long-run success rate when applied to many simulated
    measurements in the scenario. An individual application of the method is deemed
    successful if an uncertainty interval containing the measurand is obtained. The
    alternative approach to validation taken in the <italic>Supplement</italic>, that
    an uncertainty interval calculated by a Monte Carlo method can be used to validate
    the GUM method, is not consistent with the results of this study.</p>"
