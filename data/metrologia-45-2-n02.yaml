abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent work referred to two approaches for doing a Bayesian analysis
    for simple linear calibration and pointed out that there could be a difference
    between the results of applying the procedure of GUM Supplement 1 and one of those
    approaches. It will be shown that the difference between the two Bayesian approaches
    reflects the use of two different priors. It will be shown that the results obtained
    by GUM Supplement 1 are those of a Bayesian analysis with commonly used priors
    and a measurement equation that satisfies the principles of the Guide to the Expression
    of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM).</p>"
