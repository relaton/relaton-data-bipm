abstract:
- content: "<p>A well-known test of consistency in the results from an interlaboratory
    evaluation is the Birge test, named after its developer Raymond T Birge, a physicist.
    We show that the Birge test of consistency may be interpreted as a classical test
    of the null hypothesis that the variances of the results are less than or equal
    to their stated values against the alternative hypothesis that the variances of
    the results are greater than their stated values. A modern protocol for hypothesis
    testing is to calculate the classical p-value of the test statistic. The p-value
    is the maximum probability under the null hypothesis of realizing in conceptual
    replications a value of the test statistic equal to or larger than the realized
    (observed) value of the test statistic. The null hypothesis is rejected when the
    p-value is too small. We show that, interestingly, the classical p-value of the
    Birge test statistic is equal to the Bayesian posterior probability of the null
    hypothesis based on suitably chosen non-informative improper prior distributions
    for the unknown statistical parameters. Thus the Birge test may be interpreted
    also as a Bayesian test of the null hypothesis. The Birge test of consistency
    was developed for those interlaboratory evaluations where the results are uncorrelated.
    We present a general test of consistency for both correlated and uncorrelated
    results. Then we show that the classical p-value of the general test statistic
    is equal to the Bayesian posterior probability of the null hypothesis based on
    non-informative prior distributions. The general test makes it possible to check
    the consistency of correlated results from interlaboratory evaluations. The Birge
    test is a special case of the general test.</p>"
