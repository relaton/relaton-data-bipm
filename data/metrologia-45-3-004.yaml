abstract:
- content: "<p>Several radiometric and photometric measurements depend on high accuracy
    area measurement of precision apertures. Some apertures have sharp edges and are
    generally measured optically. At the Precision Engineering Division of the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), we have developed a contact fibre
    (fiber) probe for diameter and form measurement of micro-holes (holes of size
    100 µm or larger). This probe exerts extremely small forces, under 5 µN, and can
    therefore be used on knife-edge apertures without causing edge damage. We have
    measured the diameter and roundness of three knife-edge and one cylindrical apertures
    with this probe. The uncertainty in diameter ranges from 0.06 µm (k = 1) to 0.17 µm
    (k = 1). The uncertainty contributions from the probing system and machine positioning
    are together only 35 nm (k = 1). The largest contributors to the diameter uncertainty
    are the overall form (sampling uncertainty) and surface finish (mechanical filtering
    due to finite probe size) of the aperture.</p>"
