abstract:
- content: "<p>Based on the standing wave model of the macroscopically resting electron,
    classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, a theoretical relation for the
    fine structure constant α has been derived. It was found that. The ratio of the
    rest mass of the electron and its quantum mechanical fraction,  m<sub>0</sub>/
    m<sub>m</sub>, was calculated to be 1.005 263 277, using a non-relativistic Hamiltonian
    function. With this new value the reciprocal of the fine structure constant α
    is obtained to be 137.035 999 252. At Harvard University a new experimental value
    of α has been derived from the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
    and the QED calculation of this quantity (relative standard uncertainty 0.37 ×
    10<sup>−9</sup>). The relative deviation between our value and this one is 1.23
    × 10<sup>−9</sup>, supporting the usefulness and validity of our model. According
    to our result α seems to be a real constant in time and space. Relativistic QED
    of a point particle in the four-dimensional (Minkowski) space and non-relativistic
    wave electrodynamics for a macroscopically resting extended electron with an internal
    energy flux in the ordinary (3 + 1)-dimensional space time were found to complete
    each other in the sense of wave–particle dualism.</p>"
