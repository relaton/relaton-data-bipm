abstract:
- content: "<p>The pumping speed of a pump in an orifice flow standard was measured
    to enable calculation of the effective pumping speed in the calibration chamber.
    The main problems are as follows. (1) The pumping speed of a pump connected to
    a chamber of finite size is not unambiguously defined; different measuring arrangements
    lead to different values. It is necessary to measure the pumping speed of the
    pump in the same arrangement as for the orifice flow standard. (2) If this is
    to be a primary standard, gauges related to calibration of the gauge to another
    standard cannot be used for the measurement for the same range of pressures.</p><p>The
    necessary precision of the measurement was determined. The orifice method and
    the flowmeter method were tested directly in the arrangement for the orifice flow
    standard. These two methods were used to avoid the necessity of using gauges calibrated
    to another standard.</p><p>The pumping speed of the pump for the CMI orifice flow
    standard was measured with sufficiently low uncertainty, so that its effect on
    the uncertainty budget of the entire standard was negligible.</p>"
