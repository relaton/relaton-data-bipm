  content: "<p>A well-known test of consistency in the results from an interlaboratory
    evaluation is the Birge test, named after its developer Raymond T Birge, a physicist.
    We show that the Birge test of consistency may be interpreted as a classical test
    of the null hypothesis that the variances of the results are less than or equal
    to their stated values against the alternative hypothesis that the variances of
    the results are greater than their stated values. A modern protocol for hypothesis
    testing is to calculate the classical <italic>p</italic>-value of the test statistic.
    The <italic>p</italic>-value is the maximum probability under the null hypothesis
    of realizing in conceptual replications a value of the test statistic equal to
    or larger than the realized (observed) value of the test statistic. The null hypothesis
    is rejected when the <italic>p</italic>-value is too small. We show that, interestingly,
    the classical <italic>p</italic>-value of the Birge test statistic is equal to
    the Bayesian posterior probability of the null hypothesis based on suitably chosen
    non-informative improper prior distributions for the unknown statistical parameters.
    Thus the Birge test may be interpreted also as a Bayesian test of the null hypothesis.
    The Birge test of consistency was developed for those interlaboratory evaluations
    where the results are uncorrelated. We present a general test of consistency for
    both correlated and uncorrelated results. Then we show that the classical <italic>p</italic>-value
    of the general test statistic is equal to the Bayesian posterior probability of
    the null hypothesis based on non-informative prior distributions. The general
    test makes it possible to check the consistency of correlated results from interlaboratory
    evaluations. The Birge test is a special case of the general test.</p>"
