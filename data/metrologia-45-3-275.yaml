abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>We report on the first-ever use of a quantum ac source to calibrate
    a thermal transfer standard as part of the NIST calibration service for such devices,
    with reductions in calibration uncertainty of as much as an order of magnitude
    over traditional acâ€“dc transfer methods. We briefly describe the basic quantum
    ac calibration system, its operation and measurement results. An analysis of the
    uncertainties for the measurements is presented and plans for further development
    are described.</p>"
