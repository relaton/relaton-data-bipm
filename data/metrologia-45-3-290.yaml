abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes three different techniques for fitting straight
    lines to experimental data and discusses the corresponding evaluation of uncertainty.
    The techniques are (i) traditional fitting by least-squares, (ii) a Bayesian linear-regression
    analysis and (iii) an analysis according to the propagation of probability density
    functions attributed to the points measured. The material is presented to clarify
    assumptions underlying the techniques, to highlight differences between the techniques
    and to point to difficulties associated with applying the techniques under current
    views of ‘uncertainty analysis’. Considerable attention is given to the estimation
    of values of the function and not just to the estimation of parameters of the
    function. The paper gives a summary of many results of least-squares fitting,
    including some unfamiliar results for the simultaneous estimation of the unknown
    function at all points. On many occasions the unknown function will only be approximately
    linear, in which case we must define a unique unknown gradient to give proper
    meaning to our ‘estimate’ of slope. This can be achieved by defining an interval
    of interest and then applying a least-squares-type result.</p>"
