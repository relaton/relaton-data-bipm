  content: "<p>This paper proposes to discuss some concepts whose importance is fundamental
    to any theory of measurement. From the epistemological point of view there is
    a very significant inconsistency in the concept of measurand contained in the
    GUM. According to the model adopted by the GUM, a particular measurand remains
    the same measurand after a change in its definition, notwithstanding the fact
    that new conditions had been included or other pre-existing conditions had been
    altered in the definition. And also notwithstanding the very probable fact that,
    in consequence, the uncertainty component associated with its definition had been
    changed. The problem that arises from this theoretical model is that a particular
    measurand is not completely characterized by a precise and unique definition.
    Instead, it is considered an ‘ideal’ utopian particular concept to which would
    converge a specific series of ‘measurands’ (more properly their definitions),
    continually redefined in an infinite succession. Such a theoretical basis seems
    very inappropriate: the model intends to determine the uncertainty of uncertainly
    defined particular measurands. Of great relevance is the proposal of a new definition
    for the concept of measurand, a concept that interfaces the realms of Metrology
    and experimentation. Other concepts have been created or redefined with sufficient
    precision and selectivity to consider some aspects that remain somewhat confused
    in the model of measurement currently applied.</p>"
