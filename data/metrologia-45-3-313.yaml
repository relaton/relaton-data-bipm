- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>In this paper we review the theory concerning the radiofrequency (RF)
    spectrum of a carrier phase modulated by a stochastic process with spectral density
    of the type |ω|<sup>−α</sup> and 0 ⩽ α &lt; 3. This problem is of particular interest
    in the fields of atomic frequency standards and, in general, in high resolution
    spectroscopy. We also extend the theory to non-integer slopes (α real) and examine
    the role of the low-pass filter shape in the RF lineshape, pointing out the peculiar
    behaviour of the Lorentzian filter. The singular features of the RF spectrum in
    the case of flicker phase noise are examined as well as the lineshape in the high-
    and low-noise limits. Analytical expressions for the RF spectrum are also given
    in terms of special functions for the white phase, flicker phase and white frequency
    noises.</p>"
