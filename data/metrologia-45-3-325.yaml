abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper details the construction of a eutectic platinum–carbon fixed
    point (melting point approximately 1738 °C) at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB) and its validation by comparison with the one constructed by a PTB guest
    scientist at the National Metrology Institute of Japan, AIST (NMIJ).</p><p>A high-temperature
    vacuum furnace was used to construct a metal–carbon eutectic fixed point of platinum–carbon
    alloys suitable for radiation thermometry or radiometry. The furnace and fixed-point
    filling procedure were first assessed for suitability by constructing a copper
    fixed point of the same dimensions. With the filling validated a platinum–carbon
    cell was constructed. This was then compared with the one previously constructed
    by the PTB in collaboration with NMIJ. The agreement between the two fixed points
    was (+45 ± 72) mK (k = 2), meeting the reproducibility requirements for platinum–carbon
    to be used as a reference standard.</p>"
