    <p>This paper details the construction of a eutectic platinum–carbon fixed point (melting point approximately 1738 °C) at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and its validation by comparison with the one constructed by a PTB guest scientist at the National Metrology Institute of Japan, AIST (NMIJ).</p>
    <p>A high-temperature vacuum furnace was used to construct a metal–carbon eutectic fixed point of platinum–carbon alloys suitable for radiation thermometry or radiometry. The furnace and fixed-point filling procedure were first assessed for suitability by constructing a copper fixed point of the same dimensions. With the filling validated a platinum–carbon cell was constructed. This was then compared with the one previously constructed by the PTB in collaboration with NMIJ. The agreement between the two fixed points was (+45 ± 72) mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2), meeting the reproducibility requirements for platinum–carbon to be used as a reference standard.</p>
