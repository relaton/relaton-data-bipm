abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Unambiguous and consistent concepts and associated terms should govern
    the description of the results of chemical measurements. This is not yet the case
    as numerous international workshops have shown over the last decade and as the
    chemical literature amply and continuously demonstrates. A number of concepts
    and associated terms in measurement are discussed, which are used ambiguously
    in the daily work of field laboratories, in the chemical literature, in ISO Guides
    and Standards, in regulatory documents, etc. They illustrate the need for clarification
    of their definitions. The consistent use of the recently revised edition of the
    1993 ‘<italic>International Vocabulary of Basic and General Terms in Metrology</italic>’,
    henceforth (2007) called the ISO/IEC Guide 99:2007, ‘<italic>International Vocabulary
    of Metrology—Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms (VIM)</italic>’,
    is a step in the direction of achieving this goal.</p>"
