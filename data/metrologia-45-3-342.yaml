  content: "<p>Based on the standing wave model of the macroscopically resting electron,
    classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, a theoretical relation for the
    fine structure constant α has been derived. It was found that \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro280235in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>. The ratio of the rest mass
    of the electron and its quantum mechanical fraction, <italic>m</italic><sub>0</sub>/<italic>m</italic><sub>m</sub>,
    was calculated to be 1.005 263 277, using a non-relativistic Hamiltonian function.
    With this new value the reciprocal of the fine structure constant α is obtained
    to be 137.035 999 252. At Harvard University a new experimental value of α has
    been derived from the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the
    QED calculation of this quantity (relative standard uncertainty 0.37 × 10<sup>−9</sup>).
    The relative deviation between our value and this one is 1.23 × 10<sup>−9</sup>,
    supporting the usefulness and validity of our model. According to our result α
    seems to be a real constant in time and space. Relativistic QED of a point particle
    in the four-dimensional (Minkowski) space and non-relativistic wave electrodynamics
    for a macroscopically resting extended electron with an internal energy flux in
    the ordinary (3 + 1)-dimensional space time were found to complete each other
    in the sense of wave–particle dualism.</p>"
