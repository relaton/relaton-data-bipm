  content: "<p>A new design of the fixed-point cell that contains multiple metal elements
    in a single crucible has been introduced for fixed-point calibration of secondary
    thermometers such as thermocouples. A multicell with aluminium, silver and copper
    was fabricated and used for the calibration of a Pt/Pd thermocouple. The expanded
    uncertainties (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the realization of the multicell were
    0.07 °C, 0.12 °C and 0.24 °C, plus an additional term from the inhomogeneity of
    the thermocouple, for aluminium, silver and copper, respectively. These uncertainties
    are considerably smaller than those obtained from the method of calibration by
    comparison in similar temperature ranges. This proves the suitability of the metal
    multicells for the calibration of secondary thermometers.</p>"
