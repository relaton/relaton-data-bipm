  content: "<p>An experimental determination of the effect of rotational skew in the
    alignment of the electrodes of a symmetrical cross capacitor shows that the capacitance
    as determined by the axial length is reduced by the skew. A theoretical model
    is introduced to explain the effect.</p>"
