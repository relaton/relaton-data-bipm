  content: <p>We address a difficulty in appreciating that the pair-difference chi-squared-like
    statistic (Steele <italic>et al</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/39/3/4">2002

    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>43</bold> 89–97</ext-link>) is truly unmediated
    (i.e. independent of any reference value), namely the incorrect thought that this
    aggregating statistic might merely be hiding a reference value that has the same
    chi-squared. We show that the equation for this reference value commonly has no
    real solution. Regarding pair-difference statistics as unmediated statistics conveniently
    avoids any complex reference value, and offers a stark simplicity that exactly
    captures the simplest way in which measurements are really used in practical chains
    of metrological inference.</p>
