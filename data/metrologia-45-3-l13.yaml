abstract:
- content: "<p>We address a difficulty in appreciating that the pair-difference chi-squared-like
    statistic (Steele et al 2002 Metrologia 39 269–77, Douglas and Steele 2006 Metrologia
    43 89–97) is truly unmediated (i.e. independent of any reference value), namely
    the incorrect thought that this aggregating statistic might merely be hiding a
    reference value that has the same chi-squared. We show that the equation for this
    reference value commonly has no real solution. Regarding pair-difference statistics
    as unmediated statistics conveniently avoids any complex reference value, and
    offers a stark simplicity that exactly captures the simplest way in which measurements
    are really used in practical chains of metrological inference.</p>"
