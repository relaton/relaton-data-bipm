  content: "<p>We describe two methods for evaluating the dead time of a time-to-amplitude
    converter (TAC). The dead time is obtained by measuring either the corresponding
    time interval in an oscilloscope trace or the relation between the single count
    rate and the coincidence count rate. Values for the TAC dead time are obtained
    in the range from 3.4 µs to 14.3 µs for the two methods with respective standard
    uncertainties of 2.9 × 10<sup>−8</sup> s and 3.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup> s. The TAC
    dead time is applied to the calibration of coincidence-counting measurements of
    optical transmission and photon-heralding efficiency.</p>"
