  content: "<p>The paper deals with the uncertainty of differential measurements,
    obtained from the subtraction of a pair of absolute measurements. It is shown
    that if the same sensor is used to perform both measurements, a model of the sensor
    will reveal a correlation component between the uncertainty of each absolute measurement,
    reducing the uncertainty on its subtraction. The procedure followed is based on
    the Gauss–Markov estimation method, showing that differential measurement uncertainty
    vanishes when the gradient to be measured is zero. If the two absolute measurements
    are to be performed using different sensors, a calibration by comparison between
    them will result in a similar uncertainty reduction. Finally, a simulated example
    based on commercially available thermistor data is included.</p>"
