abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper deals with the uncertainty of differential measurements,
    obtained from the subtraction of a pair of absolute measurements. It is shown
    that if the same sensor is used to perform both measurements, a model of the sensor
    will reveal a correlation component between the uncertainty of each absolute measurement,
    reducing the uncertainty on its subtraction. The procedure followed is based on
    the Gaussâ€“Markov estimation method, showing that differential measurement uncertainty
    vanishes when the gradient to be measured is zero. If the two absolute measurements
    are to be performed using different sensors, a calibration by comparison between
    them will result in a similar uncertainty reduction. Finally, a simulated example
    based on commercially available thermistor data is included.</p>"
