  content: "<p>This paper describes methods for reducing the statistical uncertainty
    in measurements made by noise thermometers using digital cross-correlators and,
    in particular, for thermometers using pseudo-random noise for the reference signal.
    First, a discrete-frequency expression for the correlation bandwidth for conventional
    noise thermometers is derived. It is shown how an alternative frequency-domain
    computation can be used to eliminate the spectral response of the correlator and
    increase the correlation bandwidth. The corresponding expressions for the uncertainty
    in the measurement of pseudo-random noise in the presence of uncorrelated thermal
    noise are then derived. The measurement uncertainty in this case is less than
    that for true thermal-noise measurements. For pseudo-random sources generating
    a frequency comb, an additional small reduction in uncertainty is possible, but
    at the cost of increasing the thermometer's sensitivity to non-linearity errors.
    A procedure is described for allocating integration times to further reduce the
    total uncertainty in temperature measurements. Finally, an important systematic
    error arising from the calculation of ratios of statistical variables is described.</p>"
