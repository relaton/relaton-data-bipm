  content: "<p>When spectral ultraviolet (UV) irradiance measurements are carried
    out, the signal rendered by the spectroradiometer should be proportional to the
    cosine of the angle between the incident radiation and the normal to the entrance
    optics. The deviation from this ideal response is referred to as cosine error.
    The cosine error effect on solar irradiance measurements performed by spectroradiometer
    systems can be accounted for by using a correcting factor <italic>B</italic>.
    If the cosine response is reasonably good, the factor <italic>B</italic> can be
    considered to be 1, such that the irradiance estimates are not affected. However,
    the uncertainty of <italic>B</italic> is not zero and it can be under certain
    conditions the greatest uncertainty source affecting solar spectral UV irradiance
    measurements. In this paper, we evaluated the <italic>B</italic> uncertainty of
    a state-of-the-art UV diffuser under different radiance conditions. We applied
    a Monte Carlo-based uncertainty propagation technique that allowed us to estimate
    an upper limit for the cosine error influence. We found that irrespective of the
    wavelength and the solar zenith angle, the standard uncertainty of <italic>B</italic>
    is about 2.5% in the case of high aerosol load. Under low aerosol and cloudless
    conditions, the standard uncertainty increased with the solar zenith angle, reaching
    a maximum of 3.5% at about 55° and decreasing thereafter. We conclude that the
    cosine response of even modern entrance optics is still a significant uncertainty
    source affecting ground-based spectral UV irradiance measurements.</p>"
