abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents an approach for making inferences about the intercept
    and slope of a linear regression model when both variables are subject to measurement
    errors. The approach is based on the principle of fiducial inference. A procedure
    is presented for computing uncertainty regions for the intercept and slope that
    can be used to assess agreement between two instruments. Computer codes for performing
    these calculations, written using open-source software, are listed.</p>"
