  content: "<p>A large air-filled parallel-plate extrapolation chamber with thin graphite
    front and back electrodes is used as a primary standard measuring device for low-energy
    interstitial brachytherapy sources from which the unit of air-kerma strength or
    reference air-kerma rate can be derived. The chamber is suitable for low-energy
    photons with energies up to 40â€‰keV. The underlying principle is that the air-kerma
    rate at a given point is proportional to the increment of ionization per increment
    of chamber volume at chamber depths greater than the range of secondary electrons
    originating from the electrode. The fundamentals for evaluating the extrapolation
    curves are presented as well as a detailed description of the present set-up of
    the PTB large-volume extrapolation chamber (GROVEX). Comparisons between the GROVEX
    and other primary standards for air-kerma and reference air-kerma rate are presented.</p>"
