  content: "<p>Johnson noise thermometry comes with many imperfection effects that
    arise primarily from electromagnetic interference, the non-linearity of the electronic
    system, the transmission line error, etc. Current Johnson noise thermometers (JNTs)
    operate according to the principle of correlation by which interference noises
    would be rejected completely. Unfortunately, correlators of JNTs are observed
    to perform imperfectly in the elimination of these imperfection effects. This
    paper presents the direct imperfection effect measurements of the JNT of the National
    Institute of Metrology at the melting point of gallium. The result of these measurements
    implied that the imperfection effect of correlation acted as an equivalent input
    noise equally distributed on both probes of the JNT. A relation was derived in
    this paper to treat this equivalent input noise as a systematic error to Johnson
    noise thermometry. As a result, the systematic error arising from the measured
    imperfection effect was corrected from the measured thermodynamic temperature
    of the melting point of gallium.</p>"
