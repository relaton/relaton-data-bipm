abstract:
- content: "<p>The idea of using a ‘robust’ method of data analysis seems popular.
    Many scientists will regard such a method as being superior to one for which no
    such property is claimed. But what actually is a ‘robust’ method? This paper discusses
    what is meant by robustness in statistical analysis and, by implication, in general
    data analysis. It is motivated by recent debate surrounding the estimation of
    the Newtonian constant G from a set of measurements.</p>"
