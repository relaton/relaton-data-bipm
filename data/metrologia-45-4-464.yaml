  content: "<p>Evaluation of measurement uncertainty is considered when the value
    of the measurand depends on the continuous variable time. A concept of dynamic
    measurement uncertainty is introduced by generalizing the GUM approach. The concept
    is applied to linear and time-invariant systems which are often appropriate to
    model dynamic measurements. Digital filtering is proposed for estimating the time-dependent
    value of the measurand and the design of an appropriate FIR filter is described.
    Dynamic uncertainty evaluation is then carried out for this analysis and conditions
    are specified for its proper use. The approach is illustrated for the particular
    example of a second-order model. It is shown in terms of simulations that the
    proposed analysis yields significantly improved results when compared with the
    sometimes applied quasi-static treatment.</p>"
