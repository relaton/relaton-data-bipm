abstract:
- content: "<p>A careful study was performed to evaluate and compare uncertainties
    associated with the measurement of luminescence from chrysene by using fluorimetry
    in solution and by using solid surface room-temperature phosphorimetry (SSRTP).
    Chrysene was chosen as the luminescent analyte (measurand) for this study because
    it is a substance of environmental interest and also because it presents strong
    natural fluorescence and phosphorescence that is easily induced by the external
    heavy atom effect. The most common approach for uncertainty calculation is the
    one indicated in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement which
    is recognized worldwide. The most relevant sources of uncertainty were identified.
    The expanded uncertainty (k = 2; 95%) for SSRTP was 3.27 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mol L<sup>−1</sup>
    (3.7 ng of chrysene) with relevant contributions from the internal reproducibility,
    preparation of solutions and from the analytical curve. This value is equivalent
    to 28% of the reference analyte value. For fluorimetry, an acceptable value for
    the expanded uncertainty was achieved by preparing solutions by weighing masses
    of analyte and solvent. In this case, the huge contribution from the preparation
    of solutions by adjusting volume is minimized and the uncertainty magnitude was
    2.12 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mol L<sup>−1</sup> (21.2% of the chrysene reference concentration).
    In this case, relevant contributions were from the repeatability, the internal
    reproducibility and from the analytical curve. The preparation of solutions by
    weighing does not have a relevant impact in improving the quality of the signal
    measurements by SSRTP.</p>"
