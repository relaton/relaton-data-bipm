abstract:
- content: "<p>The stability of an electron pump composed of three junctions and on-chip
    chromium resistors at the ends is investigated as a function of applied frequencies
    on the gate electrodes. For the first time current steps have been obtained with
    frequencies f<sub>SET</sub> as high as 100 MHz. Moreover in the complete studied
    frequency range we show that the nature (white) and the level of the noise are
    independent of pumping speed within the noise floor. By generating a single-electron
    current close to 16.02 pA and measuring over 7 h, a relative type A uncertainty
    has been found of 3.9 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>. Although the experimental set-up
    described in this paper does not allow one to measure accurately an absolute value
    of the current, an alternative set-up including an external current source is
    proposed for investigating the eventual deviation of the current from the quantization
    level, e · f<sub>SET</sub>. As a matter of fact this set-up proves to be similar
    to the quantum metrological triangle experiment (QMT). We have demonstrated that
    the electron R-pump is a plausible candidate for closing the QMT experiment with
    a type A uncertainty level of 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>"
