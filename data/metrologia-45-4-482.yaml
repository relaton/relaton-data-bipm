  content: "<p>The stability of an electron pump composed of three junctions and on-chip
    chromium resistors at the ends is investigated as a function of applied frequencies
    on the gate electrodes. For the first time current steps have been obtained with
    frequencies <italic>f</italic><sub>SET</sub> as high as 100 MHz. Moreover in the
    complete studied frequency range we show that the nature (white) and the level
    of the noise are independent of pumping speed within the noise floor. By generating
    a single-electron current close to 16.02 pA and measuring over 7 h, a relative
    type A uncertainty has been found of 3.9 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>. Although the
    experimental set-up described in this paper does not allow one to measure accurately
    an absolute value of the current, an alternative set-up including an external
    current source is proposed for investigating the eventual deviation of the current
    from the quantization level, <italic>e</italic> · <italic>f</italic><sub>SET</sub>.
    As a matter of fact this set-up proves to be similar to the quantum metrological
    triangle experiment (QMT). We have demonstrated that the electron R-pump is a
    plausible candidate for closing the QMT experiment with a type A uncertainty level
    of 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>"
