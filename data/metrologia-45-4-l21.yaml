abstract:
- content: "<p>When constructing a coverage interval from the probability density
    function that describes the state of knowledge about a measurand, it seems reasonable
    to expect that the long-run success rate of that interval will be about equal
    to the stipulated coverage probability. Through a specific example, the validity
    of this criterion is examined.</p>"
