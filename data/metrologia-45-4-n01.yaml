abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantities that lie within inexactly prescribed intervals arise frequently.
    A formula for the maximum entropy probability density function (PDF) that describes
    the state of knowledge of such a quantity is given in Supplement 1 to the  Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. However, this formula applies
    only to the case for which the limits of the interval are known to lie within
    subintervals of equal lengths centred on the best estimates of the limits. In
    this paper, a PDF is derived for a quantity that is not so restricted.</p>"
