abstract:
- content: "<p>The new guideline GUM Supplement 1—Propagation of Distributions Using
    a Monte Carlo Method (GS1) is currently published by JCGM/WG1. It describes an
    approximate method to calculate the measurement uncertainty in nearly all areas
    of metrology. In this way it overcomes the various limitations and drawbacks of
    the uncertainty propagation detailed in GUM. However, GS1 demands a software implementation
    in contrast to the uncertainty propagation. Therefore we have developed a software
    tool called MUSE (Measurement Uncertainty Simulation and Evaluation), which is
    a comprehensive implementation of GS1. In this paper we present the major computational
    aspects of the software which are the sampling from probability density functions
    (PDFs), an efficient way to propagate the PDFs with the help of a block design
    through the equation of the measurand and the calculation of the summarizing parameters
    based on these blocks. Also the different quality measures which are in place
    during the life cycle of the tool are elaborated.</p>"
