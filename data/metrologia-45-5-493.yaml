  content: "<p>We consider a probabilistic model of the measurement process, based
    on identifying two main sub-processes, named observation and restitution. Observation
    constitutes the transformations involved in producing the observable output. Restitution
    constitutes the determination of the measurand (the quantity measured) from the
    observable output, and includes data processing. After providing a probabilistic
    representation of the observation sub-process, we derive appropriate formulae
    for addressing restitution and describing the overall measurement process. The
    model allows the treatment in probabilistic terms of both the random and systematic
    effects that influence the measurement process, and may prove particularly useful
    in the formulation phase of uncertainty evaluation. We also discuss the different
    ways in which the measurand can be characterized by a probability distribution,
    and demonstrate the application of the approach to the analysis of risk in conformance
    testing.</p>"
