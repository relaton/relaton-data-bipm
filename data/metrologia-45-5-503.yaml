abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement,
    a coverage factor that produces an expanded uncertainty having an approximate
    level of confidence is recommended in the final expression of the measurement
    result. The numerical value for the coverage factor depends on the probability
    density function. When a Type A evaluation following a Gaussian (normal) distribution
    is combined with a Type B one following a rectangular distribution, the resulting
    probability density function is neither Gaussian nor rectangular, but similar
    to both, which we term a Flatten–Gaussian probability density function. The variance
    of such a function is the combined variance in the usual way, but the coverage
    factor must be calculated.</p>"
