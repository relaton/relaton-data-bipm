  content: "<p>According to the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
    Measurement</italic>, a coverage factor that produces an expanded uncertainty
    having an approximate level of confidence is recommended in the final expression
    of the measurement result. The numerical value for the coverage factor depends
    on the probability density function. When a Type A evaluation following a Gaussian
    (normal) distribution is combined with a Type B one following a rectangular distribution,
    the resulting probability density function is neither Gaussian nor rectangular,
    but similar to both, which we term a Flatten–Gaussian probability density function.
    The variance of such a function is the combined variance in the usual way, but
    the coverage factor must be calculated.</p>"
