abstract:
- content: "<p>In a recent study on the measurement of SiO<sub>2</sub> film thickness
    on a silicon substrate, the thicknesses measured by various methods showed large
    offset values, giving an apparent thickness when the real thickness was extrapolated
    to zero. Compensation of these offset values is a key solution for the establishment
    of traceability in the measurement of SiO<sub>2</sub> film thickness. In this
    study, a mutual calibration method is suggested as a new method to certify the
    thickness of SiO<sub>2</sub> films on Si by compensating for the offset values.
    In a linear plot of the thicknesses measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
    (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of a series of SiO<sub>2</sub>
    films with different thicknesses, the offset value of TEM and the thickness scale
    of XPS can be mutually calibrated. Using this method, the XPS photoelectron attenuation
    length can be well defined and XPS becomes traceable in the measurement of the
    thickness of SiO<sub>2</sub> films.</p>"
