abstract:
- content: "<p>The results from an interlaboratory evaluation are said to be statistically
    consistent if they fit a normal (Gaussian) consistency model which postulates
    that the results have the same unknown expected value and stated variancesâ€“covariances.
    A modern method for checking the fit of a statistical model to the data is posterior
    predictive checking, which is a Bayesian adaptation of classical hypothesis testing.
    In this paper we propose the use of posterior predictive checking to check the
    fit of the normal consistency model to interlaboratory results. If the model fits
    reasonably then the results may be regarded as statistically consistent. The principle
    of posterior predictive checking is that the realized results should look plausible
    under a posterior predictive distribution. A posterior predictive distribution
    is the conditional distribution of potential results, given the realized results,
    which could be obtained in contemplated replications of the interlaboratory evaluation
    under the statistical model. A systematic discrepancy between potential results
    obtained from the posterior predictive distribution and the realized results indicates
    a potential failing of the model. One can investigate any number of potential
    discrepancies between the model and the results. We discuss an overall measure
    of discrepancy for checking the consistency of a set of interlaboratory results.
    We also discuss two sets of unilateral and bilateral measures of discrepancy.
    A unilateral discrepancy measure checks whether the result of a particular laboratory
    agrees with the statistical consistency model. A bilateral discrepancy measure
    checks whether the results of a particular pair of laboratories agree with each
    other. The degree of agreement is quantified by the Bayesian posterior predictive
    p-value. The unilateral and bilateral measures of discrepancy and their posterior
    predictive p-values discussed in this paper apply to both correlated and independent
    interlaboratory results. We suggest that the posterior predicative p-values may
    be used to assess unilateral and bilateral degrees of agreement in International
    Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM) key comparisons.</p>"
