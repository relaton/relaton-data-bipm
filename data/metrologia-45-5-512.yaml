  content: "<p>The results from an interlaboratory evaluation are said to be statistically
    consistent if they fit a normal (Gaussian) consistency model which postulates
    that the results have the same unknown expected value and stated variances–covariances.
    A modern method for checking the fit of a statistical model to the data is posterior
    predictive checking, which is a Bayesian adaptation of classical hypothesis testing.
    In this paper we propose the use of posterior predictive checking to check the
    fit of the normal consistency model to interlaboratory results. If the model fits
    reasonably then the results may be regarded as statistically consistent. The principle
    of posterior predictive checking is that the realized results should look plausible
    under a posterior predictive distribution. A posterior predictive distribution
    is the conditional distribution of potential results, given the realized results,
    which could be obtained in contemplated replications of the interlaboratory evaluation
    under the statistical model. A systematic discrepancy between potential results
    obtained from the posterior predictive distribution and the realized results indicates
    a potential failing of the model. One can investigate any number of potential
    discrepancies between the model and the results. We discuss an overall measure
    of discrepancy for checking the consistency of a set of interlaboratory results.
    We also discuss two sets of unilateral and bilateral measures of discrepancy.
    A unilateral discrepancy measure checks whether the result of a particular laboratory
    agrees with the statistical consistency model. A bilateral discrepancy measure
    checks whether the results of a particular pair of laboratories agree with each
    other. The degree of agreement is quantified by the Bayesian posterior predictive
    <italic>p</italic>-value. The unilateral and bilateral measures of discrepancy
    and their posterior predictive <italic>p</italic>-values discussed in this paper
    apply to both correlated and independent interlaboratory results. We suggest that
    the posterior predicative <italic>p</italic>-values may be used to assess unilateral
    and bilateral degrees of agreement in International Committee of Weights and Measures
    (CIPM) key comparisons.</p>"
