  content: "<p>Accurate density values of materials are becoming more important for
    mass and related quantity measurements. For example, it is necessary to measure
    the exact density of deadweights contributing to a load when a force is generated
    precisely in the field of force and pressure standards. However, there is no accurate
    method to determine the densities of solid materials with a volume too large to
    fit onto a conventional hydrostatic weighing system. Additionally, the density
    values of soluble materials such as powder and porous materials cannot be measured
    easily. In this paper, a new method to determine the density of materials using
    a reference gas is proposed. The proposed method is verified by comparisons with
    hydrostatic weighing and simple dimensional methods.</p>"
