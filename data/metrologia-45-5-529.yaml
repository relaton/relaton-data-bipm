abstract:
- content: "<p>Instabilities of the order of 50 µK or higher have been observed in
    water triple point cells with a thermometer well of 12 mm to 13.6 mm diameter
    during measurements at the INRiM in the framework of the Euromet.T-K7 comparison.
    In the course of many follow-up measurements, extending over more than one year,
    these anomalies have been investigated and a solution has been tried and verified.
    The use of quartz bushings has been tried, leading to a much closer agreement
    between water triple point cells of different dimensions than was hitherto achieved.
    Furthermore, the effect on the realized triple point temperature is shown, when
    no bushing is used.</p>"
