abstract:
- content: "<p>We report some theoretical and experimental results about a frequency–temperature
    compensated sapphire loaded cavity for compact hydrogen maser atomic clocks. Based
    on theoretical calculations, the frequency–temperature coefficients in the TE<sub>0 1 1</sub>
    mode of a sapphire cavity associated with two small rings of SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    can be reduced. For instance, at 50 °C, when the thickness of the SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    ring is 5 mm, the frequency–temperature coefficient can be reduced by about five
    times, and in the meantime, the quality factor can be kept at above 40 000 synchronously.
    A sapphire loaded cavity and eight small compensated chips of SrTiO<sub>3</sub>
    were prepared and a combined cavity of sapphire with SrTiO<sub>3</sub> chips was
    simulated by the finite element method and measured by experiments. The simulation
    and the related experimental results agree well. In addition, the frequency–temperature
    coefficients in two different configurations of eight SrTiO<sub>3</sub> chips
    were also measured and compared.</p>"
