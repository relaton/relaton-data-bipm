  content: "<p>The absolute frequency of the <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub>–<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub>
    clock transition of <sup>87</sup>Sr has been measured to be 429 228 004 229 873.65 (37)
    Hz using lattice-confined atoms, where the fractional uncertainty of 8.6 × 10<sup>−16</sup>
    represents one of the most accurate measurements of an atomic transition frequency
    to date. After a detailed study of systematic effects, which reduced the total
    systematic uncertainty of the Sr lattice clock to 1.5 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, the
    clock frequency is measured against a hydrogen maser which is simultaneously calibrated
    to the US primary frequency standard, the NIST Cs fountain clock, NIST-F1. The
    comparison is made possible using a femtosecond laser based optical frequency
    comb to phase coherently connect the optical and microwave spectral regions and
    by a 3.5 km fibre transfer scheme to compare the remotely located clock signals.</p>"
