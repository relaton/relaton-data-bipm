abstract:
- content: "<p>The uncertainty of the mean of autocorrelated measurements from a stationary
    process has been discussed in the literature. However, when the measurements are
    from a non-stationary process, how to assess their uncertainty remains unresolved.
    Allan variance or two-sample variance has been used in time and frequency metrology
    for more than three decades as a substitute for the classical variance to characterize
    the stability of clocks or frequency standards when the underlying process is
    a 1/f noise process. However, its applications are related only to the noise models
    characterized by the power law of the spectral density. In this paper, from the
    viewpoint of the time domain, we provide a statistical underpinning of the Allan
    variance for discrete stationary processes, random walk and long-memory processes
    such as the fractional difference processes including the noise models usually
    considered in time and frequency metrology. Results show that the Allan variance
    is a better measure of the process variation than the classical variance of the
    random walk and the non-stationary fractional difference processes including the
    1/f noise.</p>"
