  content: "<p>The uncertainty of the mean of autocorrelated measurements from a stationary
    process has been discussed in the literature. However, when the measurements are
    from a non-stationary process, how to assess their uncertainty remains unresolved.
    Allan variance or two-sample variance has been used in time and frequency metrology
    for more than three decades as a substitute for the classical variance to characterize
    the stability of clocks or frequency standards when the underlying process is
    a 1/<italic>f</italic> noise process. However, its applications are related only
    to the noise models characterized by the power law of the spectral density. In
    this paper, from the viewpoint of the time domain, we provide a statistical underpinning
    of the Allan variance for discrete stationary processes, random walk and long-memory
    processes such as the fractional difference processes including the noise models
    usually considered in time and frequency metrology. Results show that the Allan
    variance is a better measure of the process variation than the classical variance
    of the random walk and the non-stationary fractional difference processes including
    the 1/<italic>f</italic> noise.</p>"
