  content: "<p>To ensure the accuracy of positioning, an accurate and efficient system
    for calibrating the Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers must be constructed,
    especially when thousands of GPS tracking stations around the world are established
    for a variety of applications. In Taiwan, an auto-analytical system for analysing
    data quality is already established to monitor the GPS stations. However, the
    relationships between the data quality and positioning precision are not clearly
    addressed yet, and this is the main goal we want to achieve. In this study, six
    indices are chosen to characterize the relationship between the data quality and
    GPS positioning precision. They are the number of observations, multipath on L1,
    multipath on L2, occurrence of cycle slips, relative frequency offset and frequency
    instability. To reduce common errors, fourteen types of GPS receivers were selected
    and set up at an Ultra-Short Distance Network of NML (National Measurement Laboratory,
    Taiwan) in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. The results of this study indicate that
    the frequency instability is the most critical factor among the six indices of
    interest to influence the GPS positioning precision. The frequency instability
    may cause a positioning difference of as much as 17.5 mm in the precision of three-dimensional
    coordinates. The second and third most critical error sources are the number of
    observations and the multipath effect, respectively, with a maximum difference
    of 10.7 mm. In contrast, for the method of parameter estimation, the cycle slips
    and relative frequency offset have minor effects on positioning precision with
    a few occasional exceptions. The findings of this study will serve as a crucial
    indicator to classify the positioning error of the tracking stations for long
    term analysis.</p>"
