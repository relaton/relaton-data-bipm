abstract:
- content: "<p>For many applications in radiometry, spectroscopy or astrophysics,
    absolute measurement of radiant power with low uncertainty is essential. Cryogenic
    electrical substitution radiometers (ESRs) are regarded as the highest-accuracy
    primary standard detector in radiometry, from the infrared to the ultraviolet
    region; in combination with tuneable monochromatized synchrotron radiation from
    electron storage rings, their range of operation has been extended to the soft
    x-ray region. ESRs are absolute thermal detectors, based on the equivalence of
    electrical power and radiant power that can be traced back to electrical SI units
    and be measured with low uncertainties. Their core piece is a cavity absorber,
    which is typically made of copper to achieve a short response time suitable for
    use with synchrotron radiation. At higher photon energies, the use of copper prevents
    the operation of ESRs due to increasing transmittance. A new absorber design for
    hard x-rays has been developed at the laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the electron storage ring BESSY II. The Monte Carlo simulation
    code Geant4 was applied to optimize its absorptance for photon energies of up
    to 60 keV, resulting in a cavity absorber with a gold base and a cylindrical shell
    made of copper, in combination with a thermal sensitivity of around 150 mK µW<sup>−1</sup>
    and a time constant of less than 3 min, which is short compared with the lifetime
    of many hours for the storage ring current. The measurement of the radiant power
    of monochromatized synchrotron radiation was achieved with relative standard uncertainties
    of less than 0.2%, covering the entire photon energy range of three beamlines
    from 50 eV to 60 keV. Monochromatized synchrotron radiation of high spectral purity
    was used to calibrate silicon photodiodes against the ESR for photon energies
    up to 60 keV with relative standard uncertainties below 0.3%.</p>"
