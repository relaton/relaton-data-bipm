  content: "<p>The new guideline <italic>GUM Supplement 1—Propagation of Distributions
    Using a Monte Carlo Method</italic> (GS1) is currently published by JCGM/WG1.
    It describes an approximate method to calculate the measurement uncertainty in
    nearly all areas of metrology. In this way it overcomes the various limitations
    and drawbacks of the uncertainty propagation detailed in GUM. However, GS1 demands
    a software implementation in contrast to the uncertainty propagation. Therefore
    we have developed a software tool called MUSE (Measurement Uncertainty Simulation
    and Evaluation), which is a comprehensive implementation of GS1. In this paper
    we present the major computational aspects of the software which are the sampling
    from probability density functions (PDFs), an efficient way to propagate the PDFs
    with the help of a block design through the equation of the measurand and the
    calculation of the summarizing parameters based on these blocks. Also the different
    quality measures which are in place during the life cycle of the tool are elaborated.</p>"
