abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe a novel double-shield configuration applied to ac quantum
    Hall devices which is a very significant advance in that it eliminates the effect
    of all presently known ac losses. The ac quantum Hall resistance measured in this
    way is therefore an excellent quantum standard of impedance having a relative
    uncertainty well below 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>.</p>"
