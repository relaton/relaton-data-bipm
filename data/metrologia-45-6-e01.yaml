abstract:
- content: '<p>This special issue of Metrologia presents selected papers from the
    Fifth International Time Scale Algorithm Symposium (VITSAS), including some of
    the tutorials presented on the first day. The symposium was attended by 76 persons,
    from every continent except Antarctica, by students as well as senior scientists,
    and hosted by the Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada (ROA) in San Fernando,
    Spain, whose staff further enhanced their nation''s high reputation for hospitality.</p><p>Although
    a timescale can be simply defined as a weighted average of clocks, whose purpose
    is to measure time better than any individual clock, timescale theory has long
    been and continues to be a vibrant field of research that has both followed and
    helped to create advances in the art of timekeeping. There is no perfect timescale
    algorithm, because every one embodies a compromise involving user needs. Some
    users wish to generate a constant frequency, perhaps not necessarily one that
    is well-defined with respect to the definition of a second. Other users might
    want a clock which is as close to UTC or a particular reference clock as possible,
    or perhaps wish to minimize the maximum variation from that standard. In contrast
    to the steered timescales that would be required by those users, other users may
    need free-running timescales, which are independent of external information. While
    no algorithm can meet all these needs, every algorithm can benefit from some form
    of tuning. The optimal tuning, and even the optimal algorithm, can depend on the
    noise characteristics of the frequency standards, or of their comparison systems,
    the most precise and accurate of which are currently Two Way Satellite Time and
    Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) and GPS carrier phase time transfer.</p><p>The interest
    in time scale algorithms and its associated statistical methodology began around
    40 years ago when the Allan variance appeared and when the metrological institutions
    started realizing ensemble atomic time using more than one single atomic clock.
    An international symposium dedicated to these topics was initiated in 1972 as
    the first International Symposium on Atomic Time Scale Algorithms and it was the
    beginning of a series:<list list-type="unordered"><list-item><p>1st Symposium:

    Symposium: in San Fernando, Spain at the ROA in 2008.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The
    early symposia were concerned with establishing the basics of how to estimate
    and characterize the behavior of an atomic frequency standard in an unambiguous
    and clearly identifiable way, and how to combine the reading of different clocks
    to form an optimal time scale within a laboratory. Later, as atomic frequency
    standards began to be used as components in larger systems, interest grew in understanding
    the impact of a clock in a more complex environment. For example, use of clocks
    in telecommunication networks in a Synchronous Digital Hierarchy created a need
    to measure the maximum time error spanned by a clock in a certain interval. Timekeeping
    metrologists became interested in estimating time deviations and time stability,
    so they had to find ways to convert their common frequency characteristics to
    time characteristics. Tests of fundamental physics provided a motivation for launching
    atomic frequency standards into space in long-lasting missions, whose high-precision
    measurements might be available for only a few hours a day, yielding a series
    of clock data with many gaps and outliers for which a suitable statistical analysis
    was necessary to extract as much information as possible from the data. In the
    21st century, the field has been transformed by the advent of atomic-clock-based
    Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the steady increase in precision brought
    about by rapidly improving clocks and measurement systems, and the growing number
    of relatively inexpensive small clock ensembles.</p><p>Although technological
    transformations have raised the intensity and changed the details of the debates,
    the VITSAS conference showed that even the issues raised by the early symposia
    are still current. This selection of papers encompasses the full breadth of the
    VITSAS, including tutorials, laboratory-specific innovations and practices, GNSS
    applications, UTC generation, TWSTFT applications, GPS applications, small-ensemble
    applications, robust algorithms, and statistical measures that are either robust
    themselves or which reflect nonstationarity and robustness characteristics of
    the clocks.</p><p>The Editors of this special issue of Metrologia would like to
    express their thanks to the referees of the papers published here for all their
    hard work, to Drs Juan Palacio and Javier Galindo and the people of the ROA, and
    to all the attendees for the excellent symposium they have created.</p>'
