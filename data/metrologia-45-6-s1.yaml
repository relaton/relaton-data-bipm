abstract:
- content: "<p>The grey system and grey forecast are being increasingly widely used.
    As we know, a system could be a white system of which all the information can
    be known, or a black system of which none of the information can be known, or
    a grey system of which not all the information can be known. An atomic clock is,
    in fact, a grey system. We can only know the historical information of it, whereas
    there is some uncertain information for the future. In order to predict the trend
    of an atomic clock, a linear model or a non-linear model is used frequently, but
    in this paper a new model named the dynamic grey-autoregressive model is studied.
    Compared with the older methods, the dominance of the dynamic grey-autoregressive
    model is discussed in this paper, and finally, the new method is used to forecast
    the velocity of caesium clocks and hydrogen masers.</p>"
