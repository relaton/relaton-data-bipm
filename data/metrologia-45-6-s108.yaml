    <p>In this paper we use a mathematical model based on stochastic differential equations to predict the behaviour of atomic clocks. We consider several different cases with deterministic and random signatures and we obtain the best clock prediction together with its uncertainty. The results given by our mathematical model are compared with the results of the traditional method of extrapolating clock behaviour from the past data.</p>
    <p>Wyye test our methods using experimental data from caesium and hydrogen masers maintained by the Italian time laboratory (INRIM), showing the good performance of our model.</p>
