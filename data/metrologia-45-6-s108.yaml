abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we use a mathematical model based on stochastic differential
    equations to predict the behaviour of atomic clocks. We consider several different
    cases with deterministic and random signatures and we obtain the best clock prediction
    together with its uncertainty. The results given by our mathematical model are
    compared with the results of the traditional method of extrapolating clock behaviour
    from the past data.</p><p>Wyye test our methods using experimental data from caesium
    and hydrogen masers maintained by the Italian time laboratory (INRIM), showing
    the good performance of our model.</p>"
