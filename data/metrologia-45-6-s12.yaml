abstract:
- content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) operates
    22 network time servers at various locations. These servers respond to requests
    for time in a number of different formats and provide time stamps that are directly
    traceable to the NIST atomic clock ensemble in Boulder. The link between the servers
    at locations outside of the NIST Boulder Laboratories and the atomic clock ensemble
    is provided by the Automated Computer Time Service (ACTS) system, which has a
    direct connection to the clock ensemble and which transmits time information over
    dial-up telephone lines with a two-way protocol to measure the transmission delay.
    I will discuss improvements to the ACTS servers and to the time servers themselves.
    These improvements have resulted in an improvement of almost an order of magnitude
    in the performance of the system.</p>"
