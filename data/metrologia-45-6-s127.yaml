abstract:
- content: "<p>When an anomaly occurs in an atomic clock, its stability and frequency
    spectrum change with time. The variation with time of the stability can be evaluated
    with the dynamic Allan variance. The variation with time of the frequency spectrum
    can be described with the spectrogram, a timeâ€“frequency distribution. We develop
    a method that uses the dynamic Allan variance and the spectrogram to detect and
    to identify the typical anomalies of an atomic clock. We apply the method to simulated
    data.</p>"
