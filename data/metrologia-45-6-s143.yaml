abstract:
- content: "<p>The frequency spectrum of the atomic clock noise can change with time
    for several reasons. We develop a method to represent the time–frequency spectrum
    of clock noise. The method can detect and identify clock anomalies, since they
    generate non-stationarities in the time–frequency spectrum. We apply the method
    to numerical and experimental data.</p>"
