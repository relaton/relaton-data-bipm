abstract:
- content: "<p>The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is a statistical fault
    detection method used for revealing fault occurrences in electronic systems. In
    this paper, the GLRT technique is analysed and customized for a rubidium frequency
    standard in order to reveal mean or standard deviation changes in the clock frequency.
    Experimental results are presented that confirm the effectiveness of the technique
    also when it is applied to data acquired from a rubidium clock. Monte Carlo simulations
    are shown in order to characterize the proposed method and to give a simple interpretation
    of the obtained results. The effectiveness of the GLRT has been already compared
    with standard tools such as the Allan variance (Nunzi E et al 2007 IEEE Trans.
    Instrum. Meas. 56 523–8). In particular, the sensitivity of the method with respect
    to the jump size has been analysed. In this paper, the fault detection technique
    is characterized with respect to its readiness in terms of the number of samples
    employed for obtaining a failure occurrence when applied to clock frequency. Results
    obtained are employed for giving practical indications on the design of this failure
    test.</p>"
