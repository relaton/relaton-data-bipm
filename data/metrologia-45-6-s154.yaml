  content: "<p>The detection of jumps in a frequency record is a challenging problem
    by either visual or mathematical means. The former takes considerable experience
    and judgment, and is therefore quite subjective, but has the advantage of providing
    insight into device behaviour. The latter is more impartial and consistent, and
    can be automated. In combination, mathematical jump detection can be applied for
    automatic clock testing and monitoring. If a jump is detected, the record can
    then be inspected visually before deciding on the action required. This paper
    describes frequency jump detection algorithms that are included in a program for
    frequency stability analysis.</p>"
