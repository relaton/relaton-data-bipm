abstract:
- content: "<p>I will discuss the three general methods that are commonly used to
    transmit time and frequency information: one-way methods, which measure or model
    the path delay using ancillary data, two-way methods, which depend on the symmetry
    of the delays in opposite directions along the same path, and common view, in
    which several stations receive data from a common source over paths whose delays
    are approximately equal. I will describe the advantages and limitations of the
    different methods including uncertainty estimates for systems that are based on
    them.</p>"
