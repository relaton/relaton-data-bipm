abstract:
- content: "<p>The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process is presented with its main mathematical
    properties and with original results on the first crossing times in the case of
    two threshold barriers. The interpretation of filtered white noise, its stationary
    spectrum and Allan variance are also presented for ease of use in the time and
    frequency metrology field. An improved simulation scheme for the evaluation of
    first passage times between two barriers is also introduced.</p>"
