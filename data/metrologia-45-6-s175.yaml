  content: "<p>The two-state model provides an effective description of the atomic
    clock noise. We present the construction of the two-state model, which is useful
    to understand the statistics of clock noise. Furthermore, we derive the discrete-time
    version of the model, which can be used for numerical simulations. We illustrate
    our results through numerical examples.</p>"
