abstract:
- content: "<p>The ability of the Allan variance (AVAR) to identify and estimate the
    typical clock noise is widely accepted, and its use is recommended by international
    standards. Recently, a time-varying version called Dynamic Allan variance (DAVAR)
    was suggested and exploited.</p><p>Currently, the AVAR is commonly used in applications
    to space and satellite systems, in particular in monitoring the clocks of the
    Global Positioning System, and also in the framework of the European project Galileo.
    In these applications stability estimation, either AVAR or DAVAR (or other similar
    variances), presents some peculiar aspects which are not commonly encountered
    when the clock data are measured in a laboratory. In particular, data from space
    clocks may typically present outliers and missing values. Hence, special attention
    has to be paid when dealing with such experimental measurements.</p><p>In this
    work we propose an estimation algorithm and its implementation in a robust software
    code (in MATLABÂ® language) able to estimate the AVAR in the case of missing data,
    unequally spaced data, outliers, and with long periods of missing observation,
    so that the Allan variance estimates turn out unbiased and with the maximum use
    of all the available data.</p>"
