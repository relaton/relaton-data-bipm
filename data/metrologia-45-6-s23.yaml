abstract:
- content: "<p>I will describe the backup time scale system that I have constructed
    at the site of the NIST radio stations near Fort Collins, Colorado, and I will
    compare its performance with the primary ensemble in Boulder. The Fort Collins
    system is designed to be a backup for the Boulder system and is intended to support
    all of the NIST time services should the primary scale become unavailable for
    any reason. The backup time has a number of unique problems and requirements,
    and I will discuss the design considerations that I used to address these issues.
    The backup scale tracks UTC(NIST) in frequency with an uncertainty (measured by
    the Allan deviation of the difference) of about 1 × 10<sup>−14</sup> by use of
    administrative steering that is applied not more often than once per week. The
    corresponding time deviation is less than 1 ns for all averaging times less than
    1 week, and the peak time difference between UTC(NIST) and its backup realization
    is less than ±25 ns and is generally much better than this value. This is much
    better than would be needed for supporting the radio stations, the digital time
    services (ACTS, a time service that provides time in a digital format using dial-up
    telephone lines, and the Internet services) and the Frequency Measurement Service.
    Its frequency stability and time accuracy would not be adequate for the most demanding
    users of the Global Time Service and for international time and frequency coordination.
    The primary limitations to the performance of the backup time scale are caused
    by environmental perturbations, especially temperature and supply voltage, and
    the existing hardware could probably support all of the NIST services if the environment
    were improved.</p>"
