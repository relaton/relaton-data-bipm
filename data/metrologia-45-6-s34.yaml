abstract:
- content: "<p>TA(NIM) is being updated now. The new TA(NIM) uses an active hydrogen
    maser as a reference clock, and the frequency of TA(NIM) is steered by an algorithm
    to keep it the same as the NIM4 fountain clock, which is NIM's primary frequency
    standard. This paper introduces the generation of new TA(NIM), including the equations
    to predict maser frequency and the steering algorithm. The time difference and
    the frequency difference between the new TA(NIM) and UTC are also reported.</p>"
