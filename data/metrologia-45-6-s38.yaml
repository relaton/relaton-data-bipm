  content: "<p>The frequency characteristics of two hydrogen masers at the National
    Time Service Center are studied in this paper by comparing the Allan deviation
    with the Hadamard deviation. The results show that the hydrogen masers exhibit
    a linear frequency drift (Lfd) within a period of about a few tens of days. The
    main purpose here is to test whether such hydrogen masers could contribute to
    a time scale composed of a clock ensemble and how to deal with the algorithm.
    It proves feasible and effective to remove the Lfds from the phase data of the
    masers according to the frequency prediction before data are added to the time
    scale computation.</p>"
