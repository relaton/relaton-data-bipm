  content: "<p>The French atomic time scale TA(F), which is computed with data from
    about 20 industrial caesium standards located in nine French institutions, aims
    to provide a stable national frequency reference to the contributing institutions.
    To improve its stability, it was decided a few years ago to steer the time scale,
    which up to that date was free running, on the LNE-SYRTE primary frequency standards
    (PFS). The frequency of TA(F) was first slowly corrected monthly by an arbitrary
    given frequency offset with respect to TAI, to compensate the drift without disturbing
    the 30 d relative frequency stability of the time scale. Once close enough to
    the SI second, the time scale was steered monthly to the frequency data issued
    from the LNE-SYRTE PFS, in that way providing a more stable reference. We describe
    the steering applied to TA(F) and show the results in terms of relative stability
    with respect to TAI, or by comparing TA(F) with the SI second on the geoid as
    published monthly by the BIPM in its <italic>Circular T</italic>. When applying
    this steering during recent years, the departure over 30 d intervals of TA(F)
    from the SI second on the geoid was maintained inside the limits ±3 × 10<sup>−15</sup>.
    Within these limits, the TA(F) scale unit interval is in agreement with the SI
    second, a result which was made possible thanks to the four PFS currently in operation
    in the LNE-SYRTE.</p>"
