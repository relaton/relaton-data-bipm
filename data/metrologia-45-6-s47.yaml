  content: "<p>We report on the Compass global satellite navigation system and its
    time reference system. China has sent three satellites into geostationary orbit
    since 2000, and the Compass Navigation Test System has been established. Compass
    time reference, named as BDT, is based on atomic time; BDT is derived from the
    atomic clock ensemble in Compass ground control centre and can be traced to the
    international time, UTC.</p>"
