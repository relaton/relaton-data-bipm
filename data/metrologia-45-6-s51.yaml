abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper proposes methods for calibration of two network time services—NTP
    servers and time-stamp authorities. The calibration is described in conformity
    with metrological principles like other time distribution systems. The authors
    have built up the calibration sets and tested them in cooperation with five European
    time and frequency laboratories. The paper also presents and discusses experimental
    results collected by measurement of time servers between involved laboratories.</p>"
