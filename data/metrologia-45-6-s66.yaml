  content: "<p>The National Physical Laboratory, India (NPLI), is responsible for
    maintenance and development of the Indian Standard Time (IST) and also contributes
    through the GPS network to the generation of UTC coordinated by BIPM. Recently
    NPLI has made some special efforts to improve the uncertainty of UTC(NPLI) with
    respect to UTC. One basic clock ensemble algorithm is implemented to make the
    time scale of UTC(NPLI) by combining the intercomparison data of five caesium
    clocks. Some initial tests have been carried out to check the validity of this
    algorithm. The recent UTC âˆ’ UTC(NPLI) values (shown in <italic>Circular T</italic>)
    and the corresponding frequency offset with respect to UTC have exhibited significant
    improvements. This paper describes these studies and presents the analysis of
    these observations.</p>"
