abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the GIOVE Mission (GIOVE-M), two experimental satellites called
    GIOVE-A and GIOVE-B have been launched by the European Space Agency. This paper
    analyses the different issues involved in GPS/GIOVE interoperability for positioning
    and timing, including GGTO (the GPS to Galileo time offset) and timing biases,
    and presents practical experience and results related to EGGTO, the GIOVE-M experimental
    version of GGTO broadcast within the GIOVE navigation messages.</p>"
