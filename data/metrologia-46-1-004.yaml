abstract:
- content: "<p>Four independent radiation temperature scales approximating the ITS-90
    at 900 nm, 950 nm and 1.6 µm have been realized from the indium point (429.7485 K)
    to the copper point (1357.77 K) which were used to derive by extrapolation the
    transition temperature T<sub>90</sub>(Co–C) of the cobalt–carbon eutectic fixed
    point. An INRIM cell was investigated and an average value T<sub>90</sub>(Co–C)
    = 1597.20 K was found with the four values lying within 0.25 K. Alternatively,
    thermodynamic approximated scales were realized by assigning to the fixed points
    the best presently available thermodynamic values and deriving T(Co–C). An average
    value of 1597.27 K was found (four values lying within 0.25 K). The standard uncertainties
    associated with T<sub>90</sub>(Co–C) and T(Co–C) were 0.16 K and 0.17 K, respectively.
    INRIM determinations are compatible with recent thermodynamic determinations on
    three different cells (values lying between 1597.11 K and 1597.25 K) and with
    the result of a comparison on the same cell by an absolute radiation thermometer
    and an irradiance measurement with filter radiometers which give values of 1597.11 K
    and 1597.43 K, respectively (Anhalt et al 2006 Metrologia 43 S78–83). The INRIM
    approach allows the determination of both ITS-90 and thermodynamic temperature
    of a fixed point in a simple way and can provide valuable support to absolute
    radiometric methods in defining the transition temperature of new high-temperature
    fixed points.</p>"
