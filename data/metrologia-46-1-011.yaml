abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we show that an atom interferometer inertial sensor,
    when associated with the auxiliary measurement of external vibrations, can be
    operated beyond its linear range and still keep a high acceleration sensitivity.
    We propose and compare two measurement procedures (fringe fitting and non-linear
    lock) that can be used to extract, without adding any bias, the mean phase of
    the interferometer when the interferometer phase fluctuations exceed 2π. Despite
    operating in the urban environment of inner Paris without any vibration isolation,
    the use of a low noise seismometer for the measurement of ground vibrations allows
    our atom gravimeter to reach at night a sensitivity as good as 5.5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>g
    at 1 s. Robustness of the measurement to large vibration noise is also demonstrated
    by the ability of our gravimeter to operate during an earthquake with excellent
    sensitivity. For such low vibration frequency though, high pass filtering of the
    seismometer degrades its correlation with the interferometer signal, so that low
    frequency seismic vibrations appear on the gravity measurement. Nevertheless,
    our high repetition rate allows for efficient sampling of these perturbations,
    ensuring proper averaging. Such techniques open new perspectives for applications
    in other fields, such as navigation and geophysics.</p>"
