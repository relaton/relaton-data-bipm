abstract:
- content: "<p>To determine a new value of the Avogadro constant with a relative combined
    standard uncertainty of 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, the mass determination of a 1 kg<sup>28</sup>Si
    sphere is crucial and should be determined with the highest level of accuracy.
    In the next two years the laboratories involved in the International Avogadro
    Project should be able to determine the mass of a 1 kg silicon sphere under vacuum
    with a combined standard uncertainty within 5 µg. To obtain such a target it is
    essential to gain experience and to promote cooperation in mass measurement on
    silicon spheres among the laboratories involved. For this purpose an international
    comparison has been performed to evaluate the weighing procedure and to reveal
    the difficulties encountered in the mass determination of a silicon sphere.</p><p>This
    particular comparison, which is the first international mass comparison under
    vacuum conditions, has demonstrated that the reference value for the mass of a
    1 kg silicon sphere can be determined traceable to the International Prototype
    with a standard uncertainty of 4.0 µg.</p>"
