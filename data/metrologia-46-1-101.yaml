abstract:
- content: "<p>The properties of the sub-range inconsistency (SRI or Type-I non-uniqueness)
    of the standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) sub-ranges of the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) are investigated. Mathematically, SRI has the
    form of an interpolation error with zeros at each of the fixed points shared by
    the two interpolating equations, and a magnitude dependent on the differences
    in the ratios (W<sub>r</sub> − 1)/(W − 1) for each of the fixed points, where
    W is the resistance ratio R(T)/R(0.01 °C) and W<sub>r</sub> is the reference resistance
    ratio defined by ITS-90. The calibration results for a set of 60 SPRTs were analysed
    to determine the SRI for the water–zinc and water–aluminium sub-ranges. The maximum
    SRI occurs near 93.15 °C, and has an average value of 0.12 mK and a standard deviation
    of 0.48 mK. The reciprocal of the ratio (W<sub>r</sub> − 1)/(W − 1), which is
    proportional to the sensitivity of the SPRT, was found to be 1.0 ± 0.0004 for
    all 60 SPRTs, and was within 0.00005 for all fixed points for any one SPRT. This
    suggests that a single constraint on the value of the ratio might be a more useful
    and discerning SPRT-quality constraint than the current three ITS-90 constraints.</p>"
