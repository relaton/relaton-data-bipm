  content: "<p>The properties of the sub-range inconsistency (SRI or Type-I non-uniqueness)
    of the standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) sub-ranges of the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) are investigated. Mathematically, SRI has the
    form of an interpolation error with zeros at each of the fixed points shared by
    the two interpolating equations, and a magnitude dependent on the differences
    in the ratios (<italic>W</italic><sub>r</sub> − 1)/(<italic>W</italic> − 1) for
    each of the fixed points, where <italic>W</italic> is the resistance ratio <italic>R</italic>(<italic>T</italic>)/<italic>R</italic>(0.01 °C)
    and <italic>W</italic><sub>r</sub> is the reference resistance ratio defined by
    ITS-90. The calibration results for a set of 60 SPRTs were analysed to determine
    the SRI for the water–zinc and water–aluminium sub-ranges. The maximum SRI occurs
    near 93.15 °C, and has an average value of 0.12 mK and a standard deviation of
    0.48 mK. The reciprocal of the ratio (<italic>W</italic><sub>r</sub> − 1)/(<italic>W</italic>
    − 1), which is proportional to the sensitivity of the SPRT, was found to be 1.0
    ± 0.0004 for all 60 SPRTs, and was within 0.00005 for all fixed points for any
    one SPRT. This suggests that a single constraint on the value of the ratio might
    be a more useful and discerning SPRT-quality constraint than the current three
    ITS-90 constraints.</p>"
