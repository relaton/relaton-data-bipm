abstract:
- content: "<p>The Italian National Institute for Metrological Research (INRIM) primary
    standard facility for low airspeed called the towing tank is presented here. This
    is a dragging facility, i.e. it is based on the reciprocity principle. This means
    that the relative movement between air and measurement instrument is achieved
    by the translation of the latter through nominally still air. The instrument is
    mounted on a carriage which is translated over a 30 m long tank; the velocity
    measurement is obtained through the measure of the distance covered and the time
    required to cover it. The velocity measurement is therefore traceable to measurement
    of length and time primary standards. In the paper, the working principle, the
    design and the measurement chain of the towing tank are described in detail, including
    a critical discussion about the admissibility of the Galilean invariance hypothesis
    and its limits. Specific details and operating procedures aimed at reducing the
    uncertainty contributions are described. Finally, an evaluation of the uncertainty
    budget is discussed.</p>"
