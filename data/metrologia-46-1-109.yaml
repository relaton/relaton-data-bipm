  content: "<p>The Italian National Institute for Metrological Research (INRIM) primary
    standard facility for low airspeed called the <italic>towing tank</italic> is
    presented here. This is a dragging facility, i.e. it is based on the reciprocity
    principle. This means that the relative movement between air and measurement instrument
    is achieved by the translation of the latter through nominally still air. The
    instrument is mounted on a carriage which is translated over a 30 m long tank;
    the velocity measurement is obtained through the measure of the distance covered
    and the time required to cover it. The velocity measurement is therefore traceable
    to measurement of length and time primary standards. In the paper, the working
    principle, the design and the measurement chain of the <italic>towing tank</italic>
    are described in detail, including a critical discussion about the admissibility
    of the Galilean invariance hypothesis and its limits. Specific details and operating
    procedures aimed at reducing the uncertainty contributions are described. Finally,
    an evaluation of the uncertainty budget is discussed.</p>"
