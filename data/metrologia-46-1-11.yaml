abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The Consultative Committee for Length (CCL) has recommended that red
    (633 nm) unstabilized helium–neon lasers, operating on the 3s<sub>2</sub> → 2p<sub>4</sub>
    transition, should be included in the list of standard frequencies for realization
    of the metre. This paper discusses several topics relating to the recommendation:
    motivations for including an unstabilized laser in the list of standard frequencies,
    considerations in assigning a value and an uncertainty for the frequency and vacuum
    wavelength of the 633 nm transition, and problems associated with the possible
    presence of 640 nm radiation in the laser output. The fractional uncertainty assigned
    to the vacuum wavelength of the 633 nm transition is 1.5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (relative
    standard uncertainty). This uncertainty is sufficiently large to capture all sources
    of variability associated with construction or operating details of the laser
    and variations in isotopic mix that might be encountered in commercial laser tubes.</p>"
