abstract:
- content: "<p>An experiment aimed at the determination of the Newtonian constant
    of gravitation G is in progress at the Politecnico di Torino. This experiment
    is based on measurement of the period of a simple pendulum, when its gravitational
    potential is forced to cycle by moving two source masses between two positions,
    respectively, near and far from the oscillation plane. In previous papers various
    geometrical and physical effects were analysed, including internal, environmental
    and technical ones. Most effects are made irrelevant at the desired level of uncertainty
    (10<sup>−4</sup>) by the common mode rejection provided by the differential measurement
    scheme. The remaining effects were shown to impose reasonable constraints of symmetry
    and geometrical accuracy, and are quickly reviewed here. In this paper the energy
    exchange between the oscillating mass and the gravitational potential is analysed,
    and its effect on the period is evaluated. It is shown that the uncertainty contribution
    of the latter does not constitute a problem for the desired 10<sup>−4</sup> accuracy
    of G determination.</p>"
