  content: "<p>An experiment aimed at the determination of the Newtonian constant
    of gravitation <italic>G</italic> is in progress at the Politecnico di Torino.
    This experiment is based on measurement of the period of a simple pendulum, when
    its gravitational potential is forced to cycle by moving two source masses between
    two positions, respectively, near and far from the oscillation plane. In previous
    papers various geometrical and physical effects were analysed, including internal,
    environmental and technical ones. Most effects are made irrelevant at the desired
    level of uncertainty (10<sup>−4</sup>) by the common mode rejection provided by
    the differential measurement scheme. The remaining effects were shown to impose
    reasonable constraints of symmetry and geometrical accuracy, and are quickly reviewed
    here. In this paper the energy exchange between the oscillating mass and the gravitational
    potential is analysed, and its effect on the period is evaluated. It is shown
    that the uncertainty contribution of the latter does not constitute a problem
    for the desired 10<sup>−4</sup> accuracy of <italic>G</italic> determination.</p>"
