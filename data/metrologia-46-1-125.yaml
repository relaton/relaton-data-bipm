  content: "<p>The accurate measurement of differential pressure at low line pressure
    is important in many industrial and commercial activities. A new differential
    pressure standard has been developed at the Korea Research Institute of Standards
    and Science. This standard covers a measuring range of 1 Pa to 31 kPa of differential
    pressure for operation with line pressures near 100 kPa. As part of its realization,
    a new automatic weight handling device has been developed, which enables the various
    weights to be added to or removed easily from the piston without breaking the
    reference vacuum during measurements. The system can generate differential pressures
    with an expanded uncertainty of 0.026 Pa + 2.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup><italic>p</italic>
    (<italic>k</italic> = 2) in the range 1 Pa to 31 kPa.</p>"
