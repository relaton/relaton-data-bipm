abstract:
- content: "<p>The measurement errors caused by stray light of array spectrometers
    in the spectral colour measurement for light emitting diodes (LEDs) are studied.
    A stray light correction method and a filter-wheel stray light blocking technology
    are compared both by simulation and by experiment. The results show that the stray
    light may cause unacceptable measurement errors. Both the correction method and
    the filter-wheel technology are very effective in correcting the stray light errors
    for all the LEDs. The correction method needs infrared filters for white LEDs.
    An optimized design of the filter wheel is given.</p>"
