  content: "<p>Because of both scattering and absorption, ozone and aerosols lead
    to an attenuation in the surface UV irradiance. These factors can be efficiently
    retrieved from ground-based measurements of the spectral direct UV irradiance
    performed by using spectroradiometer systems. In this paper, we applied a Monte
    Carlo based exploitation technique of spectral direct UV irradiance measurements,
    which allowed us to obtain a bound within which the retrieved parameter (either
    the ozone column or an aerosol property) is expected to lie with a relatively
    high probability. The applied exploitation technique required sequentially comparing
    the ground-based measurements with a large number of spectra, each of them calculated
    by a radiative transfer model with randomly generated values of input parameters
    (i.e. the ozone column and aerosol properties). The dispersion of the generated
    values that led to acceptable matches between the measured and calculated spectra
    allowed us to compute both the estimates and the uncertainties of the retrieved
    parameters. The applied exploitation technique enabled us to describe the uncertainty
    propagation through the retrieval process and to assess the influence of the involved
    uncertainty sources. Methodological details are provided.</p>"
