  content: <p>Four independent radiation temperature scales approximating the ITS-90
    at 900 nm, 950 nm and 1.6 µm have been realized from the indium point (429.7485 K)
    to the copper point (1357.77 K) which were used to derive by extrapolation the
    transition temperature <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>(Co–C) of the cobalt–carbon
    eutectic fixed point. An INRIM cell was investigated and an average value <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>(Co–C)
    = 1597.20 K was found with the four values lying within 0.25 K. Alternatively,
    thermodynamic approximated scales were realized by assigning to the fixed points
    the best presently available thermodynamic values and deriving <italic>T</italic>(Co–C).
    An average value of 1597.27 K was found (four values lying within 0.25 K). The
    standard uncertainties associated with <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>(Co–C) and
    <italic>T</italic>(Co–C) were 0.16 K and 0.17 K, respectively. INRIM determinations
    are compatible with recent thermodynamic determinations on three different cells
    (values lying between 1597.11 K and 1597.25 K) and with the result of a comparison
    on the same cell by an absolute radiation thermometer and an irradiance measurement
    with filter radiometers which give values of 1597.11 K and 1597.43 K, respectively

    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>43</bold> S78–83</ext-link>). The INRIM approach
    allows the determination of both ITS-90 and thermodynamic temperature of a fixed
    point in a simple way and can provide valuable support to absolute radiometric
    methods in defining the transition temperature of new high-temperature fixed points.</p>
