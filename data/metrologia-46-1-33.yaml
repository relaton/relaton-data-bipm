  content: "<p>This paper describes a thorough investigation of the NPL Vega BB3500
    furnace to improve the quality and duration of the melt plateaux of a Re–C eutectic
    cell. The results of this investigation have shown that the position of the cell
    within the furnace is the most critical factor for optimizing fixed-point performance.
    It was found that better performance could be obtained from a furnace with uniform
    ring resistance than with highly non-uniform resistance profiles, but this effect
    was relatively small. When high resistance (hot) rings were deliberately introduced
    on either side of the cell, at a distance corresponding to several rings beyond
    the position of the cell, considerable improvement in the plateaux was observed.
    Nevertheless, the cell (or the cell performance or even plateaux) is very sensitive
    to the positioning of these hot rings. A new cell holder was designed and introduced.
    Raising the cell on supporting rings provided a radiative gap that increased the
    thermal uniformity of the cell itself. Carbon–carbon composite material (CC sheet)
    wrapped loosely around the cell further improved the uniformity of the cell wall
    and hence the plateau quality. Following these changes, the plateau duration was
    increased by a factor of 5.</p>"
