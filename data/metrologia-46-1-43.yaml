    <p>The paper explains relationships between various forms of efficiency curves and derives a new option for the ionization chamber efficiency representation.</p>
    <p>First, the ionization chamber efficiency term is analysed, being expressed in various units depending on experimental conditions. Then, the efficiency curve concept is explained and discussed. The next section introduces the quantities necessary for a calculation of photon energy conversion efficiency and derives its relationship to the customary form of efficiency curve. The considerations are demonstrated for the example of SIR ionization chambers whose characteristics are essential for activity determination worldwide as they serve as a pointer for international comparisons in the area of activity measurements.</p>
