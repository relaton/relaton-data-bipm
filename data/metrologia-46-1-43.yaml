abstract:
- content: "<p>The paper explains relationships between various forms of efficiency
    curves and derives a new option for the ionization chamber efficiency representation.</p><p>First,
    the ionization chamber efficiency term is analysed, being expressed in various
    units depending on experimental conditions. Then, the efficiency curve concept
    is explained and discussed. The next section introduces the quantities necessary
    for a calculation of photon energy conversion efficiency and derives its relationship
    to the customary form of efficiency curve. The considerations are demonstrated
    for the example of SIR ionization chambers whose characteristics are essential
    for activity determination worldwide as they serve as a pointer for international
    comparisons in the area of activity measurements.</p>"
