  content: <p>According to the <italic toggle="yes">Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement</italic> (GUM) on which the expression of uncertainty in the field
    of metrology is based, since 1995, ‘it is assumed that the results of a measurement
    have been corrected for all recognised significant systematic effects’. Since
    the International Temperature Scale of 1990 specifies that the substances used
    for the realization of the ‘fixed points’ be ‘ideally pure’, to fully implement
    the intent of the GUM corrections should be applied for any chemical impurities
    that affect the value of the measurand. In general, thermometrists' opinion is
    that significant laboratory research and more literature search are still needed
    for further progress towards reliable corrections. This paper, reviewing the available
    literature data, shows that the situation is more favourable in the case of the
    substances used for the realization of the Scale reference points in the range
    13.8 K to 273.16 K based on the use of hydrogen, neon, oxygen and argon. The appendix
    reports a similar review also for nitrogen. Then the paper discusses the other
    conditions, physical–chemical and thermal, of the substances inside the thermometric
    cells, concurring with the chemical impurity effects to the overall state of knowledge
    of the realized triple point temperature relevant to the solution of the problem
    of performing the corrections.</p>
