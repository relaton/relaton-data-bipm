abstract:
- content: "<p>According to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    (GUM) on which the expression of uncertainty in the field of metrology is based,
    since 1995, ‘it is assumed that the results of a measurement have been corrected
    for all recognised significant systematic effects’. Since the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 specifies that the substances used for the realization of the ‘fixed
    points’ be ‘ideally pure’, to fully implement the intent of the GUM corrections
    should be applied for any chemical impurities that affect the value of the measurand.
    In general, thermometrists' opinion is that significant laboratory research and
    more literature search are still needed for further progress towards reliable
    corrections. This paper, reviewing the available literature data, shows that the
    situation is more favourable in the case of the substances used for the realization
    of the Scale reference points in the range 13.8 K to 273.16 K based on the use
    of hydrogen, neon, oxygen and argon. The appendix reports a similar review also
    for nitrogen. Then the paper discusses the other conditions, physical–chemical
    and thermal, of the substances inside the thermometric cells, concurring with
    the chemical impurity effects to the overall state of knowledge of the realized
    triple point temperature relevant to the solution of the problem of performing
    the corrections.</p>"
