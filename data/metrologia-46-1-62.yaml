abstract:
- content: "<p>A new high-resolution automatic scanning method is developed for measuring
    the size-of-source effect (SSE) of radiation thermometers. The method has several
    advantages over the traditional direct and indirect methods for measuring the
    SSE, and is much easier to implement. A mathematical model of the SSE is developed
    and is used to relate the new method to the direct and indirect methods, demonstrating
    that all three are equivalent. Experimental results are presented that confirm
    the equivalence of these methods to a high degree of accuracy. Equations are also
    given for correcting the SSE for measurements on extended non-uniform sources.</p>"
