abstract:
- content: "<p>The applicability of biased and random error models for determining
    the uncertainty of photometer quality factor \n using Monte Carlo simulations
    is investigated. In the biased error model the contribution to the measured value
    has the same sign and almost the same magnitude at neighbouring wavelengths, whereas
    in the random error model contributions of varying signs appear at the neighbouring
    wavelengths. Both error models are used with real spectral responsivity data and
    uncertainty budgets of two photometers. Analytical considerations supported by
    simulation results show that the random error model alone may easily underestimate
    the uncertainty of. The biased error model is recommended as the basis of the
    uncertainty evaluation of. It is also demonstrated by real photometer data that
    the uncertainty of \n can be highly sensitive to fine details of the photometer
    spectral responsivity when the biased error model is used.</p>"
