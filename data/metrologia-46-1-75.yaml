  content: "<p>The applicability of biased and random error models for determining
    the uncertainty of photometer quality factor \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro290631in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    using Monte Carlo simulations is investigated. In the biased error model the contribution
    to the measured value has the same sign and almost the same magnitude at neighbouring
    wavelengths, whereas in the random error model contributions of varying signs
    appear at the neighbouring wavelengths. Both error models are used with real spectral
    responsivity data and uncertainty budgets of two photometers. Analytical considerations
    supported by simulation results show that the random error model alone may easily
    underestimate the uncertainty of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro290631in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>.
    The biased error model is recommended as the basis of the uncertainty evaluation
    of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro290631in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>. It
    is also demonstrated by real photometer data that the uncertainty of \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro290631in001.gif\"></inline-graphic> can be highly sensitive
    to fine details of the photometer spectral responsivity when the biased error
    model is used.</p>"
