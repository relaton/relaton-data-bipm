abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses a fiducial approach for constructing uncertainty
    intervals for the distance between k normal means and the origin. When k = 2 this
    distance is equivalent to the magnitude of a complex-valued quantity. A simulation
    study was conducted to assess the frequentist performance of the proposed fiducial
    intervals and to compare their performance with the methods from the Guide to
    the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement and from Supplement 1 to the ‘Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’—Propagation of Distributions
    using a Monte Carlo Method. Our results indicate that the fiducial intervals generally
    outperform the GUM and GUM Supplement 1 methods with respect to frequentist coverage
    probabilities. Computer programs for calculating the fiducial intervals, written
    using open-source software, are listed.</p>"
