  content: "<p>This paper discusses a fiducial approach for constructing uncertainty
    intervals for the distance between <italic>k</italic> normal means and the origin.
    When <italic>k</italic> = 2 this distance is equivalent to the magnitude of a
    complex-valued quantity. A simulation study was conducted to assess the frequentist
    performance of the proposed fiducial intervals and to compare their performance
    with the methods from the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>
    and from <italic>Supplement 1 to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
    Measurement’—Propagation of Distributions using a Monte Carlo Method</italic>.
    Our results indicate that the fiducial intervals generally outperform the GUM
    and GUM Supplement 1 methods with respect to frequentist coverage probabilities.
    Computer programs for calculating the fiducial intervals, written using open-source
    software, are listed.</p>"
