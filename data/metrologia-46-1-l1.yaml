abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent contribution to this journal describes a particular situation
    of uncertainty assessment where probabilistically symmetric coverage intervals,
    produced in accordance with the Supplement 1 to the GUM, cover the measurand with
    frequency much smaller than their nominal coverage probability, in a long sequence
    of simulated repetitions of the measurement process and corresponding uncertainty
    assessment, in each of which the value of the measurand is assumed known.</p><p>These
    findings motivate our contribution to the ongoing, accelerating discussion of
    that Supplement, which began years before its publication, and has only gained
    momentum with the recent release of its final form.</p><p>We begin by suggesting
    that the coverage intervals whose frequentist performance has been found to be
    poor, indeed are coverage intervals for a quantity different from the measurand
    that is the focus of attention, and we offer a fresh viewpoint wherefrom to appreciate
    the situation.</p><p>Next, we point out that the Monte Carlo method for uncertainty
    propagation that is the core contribution of Supplement 1 is valid under very
    general conditions, indeed much more general than the conditions Supplement 1
    lists as sufficient for its valid application.</p><p>To produce a coverage interval
    according to the Supplement 1 involves two steps: generating a sample of values
    of the measurand via a Monte Carlo procedure and then summarizing this sample
    into a coverage interval. Although the Supplement favours probabilistically symmetric
    intervals, it also states explicitly that other prescriptions are tenable. With
    this in mind, finally we explain that the choice of summarization can be interpreted
    as reflecting a priori beliefs about the measurand.</p><p>In the particular case
    under consideration in the motivating contribution, where the measurand is known
    to be non-negative, the choice of either a probabilistically symmetric interval
    or an interval whose left endpoint is 0 would correspond to two quite different
    prior beliefs. Considering this lesson, we suggest that, in all cases, the best
    course of action is to adopt a Bayesian approach that naturally reveals all participating
    assumptions and beliefs openly, and makes all of them accessible to examination
    and criticism, as befits every scientific procedure.</p>"
