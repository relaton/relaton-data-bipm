abstract:
- content: "<p>We reply to the comment by showing how our formula for the evaluation
    of global consumer's risk on the one hand is mathematically equivalent to that
    proposed by the commenter. On the other hand it is safer from potential misuse,
    since it makes clear the role, in such an evaluation, of the distribution p(x),
    which governs the behaviour of the production process. Then we discuss some practical
    ways for obtaining such a distribution.</p>"
