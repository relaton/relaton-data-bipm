    <p>A comparison of capacitance at 10 pF was conducted between thirteen participating laboratories from the Asia-Pacific region.  Measurements were made between 2004 and 2006.  The behaviour of the travelling artefact was consistent with a steady linear drift at a rate of approximately 0.1 ÂµF/F per year.  Despite the wide range of capabilities within the region, the results showed good agreement between all but one of the participating laboratories.</p>
