    <p>A bilateral comparison subsequent to key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/01005">CCEM.RF-K9</ext-link> was decided between VNIIFTRI and PTB. It was registered into the BIPM KCDB under the identifier CCEM.RF-K9.1. The results of this comparison were gathered by the pilot laboratory of comparison CCEM.RF-K9, the LNE, and a very good agreement was found between the two participants.</p>
