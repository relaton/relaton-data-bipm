abstract:
- content: "<p>The electrical conductivity of non-ferrous metals with conductivities
    in the range 2.2 MS/m to 35.8 MS/m, provided by NPL in the form of bars (600 mm
    by 80 mm by 10 mm) and square blocks (80 mm side by 10 mm), was measured using
    an AC method at NPL and a DC method at PTB and VSL. The purpose of the comparison
    was to establish if there is a difference in the electrical conductivity measured
    for AC and DC conditions. Conductivity standards are used by industries involved
    with non-destructive testing (NDT) and evaluation (NDE) to calibrate the instruments
    used. These instruments operate at frequencies of at least 60 kHz and it was therefore
    necessary to establish agreement between AC and DC methods.</p><p>For all cases
    the uncertainty for AC conductivity measurements is considerably larger than that
    for DC measurements due to the increased complexity of the unique NPL bridge method.
    For DC measurements on blocks the PTB and VSL values agreed within the measurement
    uncertainties provided. A small difference between the values for a bar made from
    Nordic gold was removed when the CMC uncertainty for PTB was used. A better agreement
    between the DC measurement for blocks is believed to be due to a reduced sensitivity
    to material homogeneity as well as fewer dimensional measurements for the Van
    der Pauw technique used. A significant difference between the measured AC and
    DC conductivities for the titanium bar was found. This is believed to be due to
    a variation in the properties of the material through the thickness. The AC method
    is surface sensitive and so such a change in properties will influence the value
    compared to DC methods that are a volume average.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach
