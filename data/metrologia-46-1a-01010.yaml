    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, in March 2009. For this exercise, three different measurement methods were carried out: the two different options of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol as well as the measurement protocol applied by NIST. The results of both participants are in very good agreement and the overall relative standard uncertainty is 9.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>.</p>
