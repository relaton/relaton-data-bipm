abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, in March 2009. For this exercise, three
    different measurement methods were carried out: the two different options of the
    BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol as well as the measurement protocol applied
    by NIST. The results of both participants are in very good agreement and the overall
    relative standard uncertainty is 9.5 parts in 10<sup>11</sup>.</p><p> Main text.
