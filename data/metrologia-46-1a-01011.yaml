    <p>This report describes the results obtained from a NMIA(Australia)–BIPM bilateral comparison of 1 Ω resistance standards in the period 2008–2009. The comparison was carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.a. Three BIPM 1 Ω travelling standards of CSIRO type were calibrated first at the BIPM, then at the NMIA and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability of the transfer standards was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer was significantly smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations.</p>
    <p>The BIPM results are based on the conventional value  <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub>. Those from the NMIA are traceable to a calculable capacitor. The uncertainty of the comparison includes therefore the standard uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> that applies to the use of the quantum Hall effect as a representation of the ohm.</p>
    <p>The NMIA and the BIPM calibrations were found to be in agreement, with a mean difference smaller than the expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the comparison.</p>
