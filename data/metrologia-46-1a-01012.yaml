    <p>This report describes the results obtained from a NML(Ireland)–BIPM bilateral comparison of 1 Ω resistance standards in 2008. The comparison was carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.a. Two BIPM 1 Ω travelling standards of CSIRO type were calibrated first at the BIPM, then at the NMLI and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability of the transfer standard was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer was significantly smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations. The NMLI and the BIPM calibrations were found to be in good agreement, with a mean difference smaller than the expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
