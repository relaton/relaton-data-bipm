abstract:
- content: "<p>This report describes the results obtained from a NML(Ireland)–BIPM
    bilateral comparison of 10 kΩ resistance standards in 2008. The comparison was
    carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.b.
    Two BIPM 10 kΩ travelling standards of SR104 type were calibrated first at the
    BIPM, then at the NMLI and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability
    of the transfer standards was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer
    was smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations. The NMLI and the
    BIPM calibrations were found to be in good agreement, with a mean difference smaller
    than the expanded uncertainty ( k  = 2) of the comparison.</p><p> Main text. \nTo

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
