    <p>From 2002 to 2004 the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) carried out a Key Comparison (KC) of water triple point cells (CCT-K7). In 2005 the Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) EURAMET decided to initiate an additional KC of water triple point cells, EUROMET.T-K7, to extend the metrological equivalence to a larger number of national metrology institutes (NMIs) from the EURAMET region.</p><p>The EUROMET.T-K7 comparison was carried out in 2006–2008 with the coordination of VSL and the participation of 24 EUROMET NMIs, 9 of them having participated in CCT-K7 as well (8 out of 9 used the same transfer cell they had used in CCT-K7).</p><p>This report presents the results of this comparison, provides detailed information of the measurements performed by all participating laboratories and links the comparison results to the CCT-K7 comparison.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
