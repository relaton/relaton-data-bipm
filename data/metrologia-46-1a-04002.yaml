    <p>The results of supplementary comparison EUROMET.L-S16 are reported. This was a comparison on the measurement of gauge block central length using mechanical comparators. Eleven NMIs took part, including the two pilot laboratories—NPL and MSA, and a EURAMET Corresponding NMI—INPL. The artefact circulation took place from June 2004 to December 2005 and sixteen gauges block were circulated, eight in steel, eight in tungsten carbide. The measurand was the central length of the gauge blocks, determined as the deviation from nominal length. Participants were also asked to measure, if possible, the variation in length, as determined from measurements at five locations on the gauge surface. The results were analysed using the weighted mean and all laboratories' results are in agreement with the weighted mean, within the 95% confidence level uncertainty bounds, i.e. there are no outliers. This is also the case for the determination of the central length and also the variation in length.</p><p>Main text.
