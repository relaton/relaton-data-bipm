    <p>The results of the APMP key comparison on calibration of gauge blocks by interferometry (APMP.L-K1.1) are reported. The comparison was planned to follow up the previous comparison APMP.L-K1. The comparison involved the measurement, by seven participating institutes, of ten steel gauge blocks ranging from 0.5 mm to 100 mm in length using techniques based on interferometry. The results are analyzed using E<sub>n</sub> values with weighted mean values as the reference values. For calculating the reference values some measurement results had to be excluded by application of the E<sub>n</sub>-criterion. Investigations of the reasons for the deviations have already been started by the respective institutes.</p><p>Main text.
