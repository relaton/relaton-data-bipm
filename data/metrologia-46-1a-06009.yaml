abstract:
- content: "<p>An indirect comparison of the standards for the quantity absorbed dose
    to water was carried out between the Van Swinden Laboratorium (VSL) and the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in September 2005. The comparison was
    based on the calibration coefficients determined for three NE2611A type ionization
    chambers under reference conditions in the<sup>60</sup>Co beams of both institutes.
    The comparison result, reported as a ratio of the VSL and the BIPM evaluations,
    is 0.9926 with a relative standard uncertainty of 4.9 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. This
    result replaces the previous indirect comparison result obtained in 2000 for the
    ongoing   BIPM.RI(I)-K4  comparison. The degrees of equivalence for the VSL standard
    and the nine other national metrology institutes in this comparison are presented
    in the form of a matrix, together with those of a linked regional comparison.
    The opportunity was also taken to undertake a pilot study using the VSL water
    calorimeter at the BIPM.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper,
