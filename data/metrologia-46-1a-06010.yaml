    <p>In 2009, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, submitted a sample of known activity of<sup>64</sup>Cu to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The value of the activity submitted was about 9.3 MBq. The result of this new comparison has been approved for publication by Section II of the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation (CCRI(II)), comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64.</p><p>Main text.
