abstract:
- content: "<p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Laboratoire
    National de Métrologie et d'Essais–Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (LNE–LNHB),
    France and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried
    out in the<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2008. The result,
    expressed as a ratio of the LNE–LNHB and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is
    0.9984 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The result
    of the earlier direct comparison in<sup>137</sup>Cs γ rays, made in 1995, was
    1.0019(30); taking into account the changes made to the BIPM standard and using
    the present correction factors for the LNE–LNHB standard, the 1995 result becomes
    0.9989(26), which is in agreement with the present comparison result.</p><p> Main
