    <p>A comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Institute of Metrology of China and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures was carried out in  <sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation at the BIPM in December 2001. The ratio of the NIM and the BIPM standards for air kerma is 0.9992, with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0018.</p>
    <p>The degrees of equivalence between the NIM and the other participants in the ongoing key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K1 have been calculated and the results are presented in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
