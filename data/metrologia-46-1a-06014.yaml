    <p>The international comparison of radioactivity measurements of<sup>133</sup>Ba (APMP.RI(II)-K2.Ba-133) was carried out within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). In total, ten institutes took part in the comparison, and five institutes undertook absolute measurements. Nine of the results agreed with each other within their specified uncertainties. The source from the same radioactive solution that was used in the comparison was sent to the BIPM/SIR in order to link this regional comparison to the BIPM key comparison reference value (KCRV). The degrees of equivalence between the APMP comparison and the other measurements for<sup>133</sup>Ba are presented.</p><p>Main text.

    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
