abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>This bilateral comparison of Rockwell scales involving the Kazakhstan Institute of Metrology (KazInMetr) was agreed upon in the year 2006 in the COOMET theme 371/KZ/06, in which should participate the hardness laboratories of the national metrology institutes of Germany (PTB) and Kazakhstan (KazInMetr). The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (Braunschweig, Germany) declared its readiness to act as pilot laboratory of this supplementary COOMET comparison.</p><p>The COOMET Rockwell PTB/KazInMetr comparison can be considered as a successful metrological exercise. The stated uncertainties were confirmed by the measurement result differences that were found. It is recommended to concentrate metrological investigations on the influence of ball indenter deviations at the HRT scale.</p><p>Main text.
