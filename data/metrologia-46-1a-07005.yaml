    <p>This report describes the key comparisons named CCM.F-K1.a and CCM.F-K1.b, for force with loads of 5 kN and 10 kN. The Draft A Report, reporting the measurement results of the key comparisons, has been accepted at the force expert group meeting in Pretoria on 23 March 2004. This became Part 1 of the preliminary Draft B Report. Then, there have been several discussions to find the best way for the determination of the reference value for force values 5 kN and 10 kN in the key comparisons CCM.F-K1.a and CCM.F-K1.b. Following the meeting held in Queretaro, Mexico, by CENAM, from 3 to 5 December 2007, the reference values have been calculated for each single transducer (see chapter 2), and as one reference value for 5 kN and a second reference value for 10 kN (see chapter 3). To get a better consistency a linear model for the drift of transducers has been applied. The results have been evaluated according to the paper from M G Cox, 'The evaluation of key comparison data' (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/39/6/10">2002  <italic>Metrologia</italic>  <bold>39</bold> 589â€“595</ext-link>).</p>
