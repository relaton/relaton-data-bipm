    <p>Hydrometers are instruments usually made of glass which are widely used for different levels of precision to measure liquid density and related quantities to control different products and processes. This bilateral comparison on the calibration of hydrometers shows that results reported by CENAM–Mexico and INRIM–Italy are consistent within the claimed uncertainty in the range of 800 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1200 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
    <p>This bilateral comparison is intended to link the two regional comparisons SIM.M.D-K4 and EURAMET.D-K4.</p>
