    <p>This SIM comparison on the calibration of high accuracy hydrometers was carried out within fourteen laboratories in the density range from 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 1300 kg/m<sup>3</sup> in order to evaluate the degree of equivalence among participant laboratories.</p>
    <p>This key comparison anticipates the planned key comparison CCM.D-K4, and is intended to be linked with CCM.D-K4 when results are available.</p>
