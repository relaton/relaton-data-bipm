    <p>This report describes the results of a key comparison of hydraulic high-pressure standards at three national metrology institutes (NMIs: NMIJ/AIST, MSL and NML-SIRIM), which was carried out during the period June 2007 to February 2008 within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) in order to determine their degrees of equivalence at pressures in the range from 10 MPa to 100 MPa for gauge mode. The pilot institute was the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST). All participating institutes used hydraulic pressure balances as their pressure standards. High-precision pressure transducers were used as a transfer standard. The sensing element of the transducer was a precision quartz crystal resonator. To ensure the reliability of the transfer standard, two pressure transducers were used in the transfer standard unit. During this comparison, the transfer standard was calibrated at the pilot institute five times in total. These results show that the transfer standard was sufficiently stable to meet the requirements of the comparison. The degrees of equivalence of each national measurement standard were expressed quantitatively by two terms, deviations from the key comparison reference values and pair-wise differences of their deviations. The hydraulic pressure standards in the range from 10 MPa to 100 MPa, for gauge mode, of the three participating NMIs were found to be fully equivalent within their claimed uncertainties. The degrees of equivalence in this comparison were also transferred to the corresponding CCM key comparison,  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/42/1A/07005">CCM.P-K7</ext-link>, and it is shown that the values of the participating NMIs were equivalent to the CCM KCRV within the claimed uncertainties.</p>
