- content: |-
    <p>Mass calibration is an important activity for national institutes of metrology, due to the number of measurements on scientific, industrial and legal activities that have traceability to the national mass standards of each country.</p><p>The main objectives of this SIM comparison were:<p>to evaluate the stated uncertainty offered by CENAM-Mexico and INEN-Ecuador in the calibration of mass standards by subdivision methods, and</p><p>to evaluate the degree of equivalence between CENAM-Mexico and INEN-Ecuador in the calibration of mass standards by subdivision methods.</p>
    In order to reach such objectives, two weights of stainless steel were measured in both laboratories from February to March 2009. For the measurements each laboratory used its own facilities, equipment, mass standards and procedures. The measurements done by the laboratories are traceable to CENAM's prototype (for CENAM), and  NIST's prototype (for INEN).</p><p>Results reported by both participants are consistent within the reported uncertainties, the largest normalized error calculated for this comparison being 0.73.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by SIM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
