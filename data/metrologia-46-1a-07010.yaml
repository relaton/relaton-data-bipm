    <p>This report summarizes the results of a EUROMET comparison of multiples and submultiples of the kilogram carried out between 25 laboratories. The transfer standards comprised five sets of weights (each set comprising 10 kg, 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg) which were circulated in parallel, each set between five of the listed participants. The majority of the results of the participants are consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value of comparison CCM.M-K2 to which this comparison has been linked.</p><p>Main text.
