    <p>This report summarizes the results of comparison EUROMET.M.M-K2.1 of multiples and submultiples of the kilogram carried out between 11 laboratories. The transfer standards comprised five weights of nominal mass 10 kg, 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg. The majority of the results of the participants are consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value of comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/07004">CCM.M-K2</ext-link> to which this comparison has been linked.</p>
