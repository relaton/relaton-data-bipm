    <p>In the sequence of CIPM key comparisons concerning volume calibrations an interregional comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/07005/">CCM.FF-K4</ext-link> was performed between December 2003 and March 2005 for volume standards of 20 L and 100 mL. The corresponding regional part of this comparison within Europe was performed in 2006 for a 100 mL Gay-Lussac Pycnometer—<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/07009/">EUROMET.M.FF-K4</ext-link> (EUROMET project number 692). It was decided during the EUROMET meeting in Istanbul 2007 to also perform the regional part of this key comparison at 20 L, as EURAMET.M.FF-K4.b (EURAMET project number 1008).</p>
    <p>This comparison was guided by IPQ (Portugal) with SP (Sweden) acting has the pilot laboratory having taken part in the interregional exercise. Fourteen countries decided to participate in this comparison.</p>
    <p>One of three 20 L pipettes, 710-04FyV used in the CCM.FF K4, was readjusted by CENAM (Mexico), which initiated this key comparison and produced the transfer standard.</p>
    <p>The main purpose of this project was to compare the experimental results and uncertainty calculations in calibrating this 20 L pipette and linking the intra-regional European results with the results obtained in the previous inter-regional CIPM key comparison.</p>
    <p>The results of all laboratories participating in EURAMET project 1008 are presented in this report as well as their equivalence with the reference value of the key comparison CCM.FF-K4.</p>
