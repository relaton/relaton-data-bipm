    <p>In the sequence of CIPM key comparisons concerning volume calibrations an interregional comparison CCM.FF-K4 was performed between December 2003 and March 2005 for volume standards of 20 L and 100 mL. The corresponding regional part of this comparison within Europe was performed in 2006 for a 100 mL Gay-Lussac Pycnometer—EUROMET.M.FF-K4 (EUROMET project number 692). It was decided during the EUROMET meeting in Istanbul 2007 to also perform the regional part of this key comparison at 20 L, as EURAMET.M.FF-K4.b (EURAMET project number 1008).</p><p>This comparison was guided by IPQ (Portugal) with SP (Sweden) acting has the pilot laboratory having taken part in the interregional exercise. Fourteen countries decided to participate in this comparison.</p><p>One of three 20 L pipettes, 710-04FyV used in the CCM.FF K4, was readjusted by CENAM (Mexico), which initiated this key comparison and produced the transfer standard.</p><p>The main purpose of this project was to compare the experimental results and uncertainty calculations in calibrating this 20 L pipette and linking the intra-regional European results with the results obtained in the previous inter-regional CIPM key comparison.</p><p>The results of all laboratories participating in EURAMET project 1008 are presented in this report as well as their equivalence with the reference value of the key comparison CCM.FF-K4.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
