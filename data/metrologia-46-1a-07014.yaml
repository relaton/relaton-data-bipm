    <p>This report summarizes the results of a comparison of mass standards conducted between eleven participating members, including the pilot laboratory, of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Program (APMP). One set of five weights with nominal mass values 10 kg, 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg were used as traveling artifacts.  These nominal values were chosen as they followed the nominal values of  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/07004">CCM.M-K2</ext-link>. The program was piloted by the National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi, India (NPLI), and the Center for Measurement Standards, Industrial Technology Research Institute (CMS-ITRI), Taiwan, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Korea, and Measurement Standards Laboratory (MSL), New Zealand, have provided all other help to successfully organize and run the comparison. The set of five weights was circulated among all the participating laboratories in July 2004 and received back from the last participant in March 2007. The final report of this comparison is being given in this document.</p>
