abstract:
- content: "<p>The bilateral comparison APMP.M.H-S2 of hardness measurement for Rockwell
    scales A and B was arranged by the National Institute of Metrology of Thailand,
    NIMT, as the pilot laboratory, comparing with Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    of Germany, PTB. The objective of this comparison was to confirm the calibration
    and measurement capabilities of NIMT in hardness measurement. The period of measurement
    covered March to August 2009. There were two sets of artefacts: scale A artefact
    set and scale B artefact set. The scale A artefact set consisted of seven hardness
    blocks: 35 HRA, 40 HRA, 55 HRA, 60 HRA, 70 HRA, 80 HRA, 85 HRA. The artefact set
    for scale B consisted of nine hardness blocks: 25 HRB, 30 HRB, 40 HRB, 50 HRB,
    60 HRB, 70 HRB, 80 HRB, 90 HRB, 100 HRB. Laboratories had to ensure that the primary
    Rockwell hardness machines passed the verification process according to ISO 6508-3.
    Then participants measured the hardness value by making ten indentations in a
    designated area of each artefact block. Hardness measurement results and uncertainty
    budget were then reported to the pilot laboratory and were used to compute the
    degrees of equivalence in terms of the Comparison Reference Value (CRV) and   E<sub>n</sub>
    \ ratio.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on   Final

    and approved for publication by APMP, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
