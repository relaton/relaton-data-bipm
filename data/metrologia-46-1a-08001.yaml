abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Ten compressed gas cylinders from NIST containing binary mixtures with propane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide or nitric oxide, all of them with nitrogen balance, were shipped to CENAM for the purpose of bilateral comparison between CENAM and NIST.</p><p>CENAM utilized its own gravimetrically prepared Primary Reference Materials (PRM) to measure the respective concentrations and reported to NIST. The cylinders were shipped back to NIST for verification of their value.</p><p>Main text.
