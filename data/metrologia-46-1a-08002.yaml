    <p>The CCQM-K58 key comparison was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM to test the abilities of the national metrology institutes to measure the mass fractions of nitrogen and trace elements in silicon nitride powder. Elements to be analysed were Al, Fe, Ca, Ti and N in silicon nitride powder. National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) acted as the coordinating laboratories. The number of participants was small, but they used various measurement methods. Comparability of measurement results was successfully demonstrated by the participating NMIs for the measurement of the mass fractions of Al, Fe, Ca, Ti and N in silicon nitride powder at the concentration levels of 824 mg/kg for Al, 351 mg/kg for Fe, 105 mg/kg for Ca, 13.8 mg/kg for Ti and 38.5% for N within related expanded uncertainties.</p><p>It is expected that metals at the concentration level of more than several mg/kg in fine ceramic powder can be determined by each participant with the same technique(s) used for this key comparison within the similar uncertainties mentioned in the present report. It is also expected that nitrogen in silicon nitride powder can be measured by each participant with the same technique used for this key comparison within the similar uncertainty mentioned in the present report.</p><p>Main text.
