    <p>As part of the on-going key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has been performed between the ozone national standard of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and the common reference standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone mole fraction range of 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol. Prior to the comparison, the NPL standard was upgraded with the NIST 'SRP upgrade kit' in the BIPM laboratories. The effect of this upgrade is reported here.</p>
