    <p>As part of the on-going key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has been performed between the ozone national standard of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and the common reference standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone mole fraction range of 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol. Prior to the comparison, the NPL standard was upgraded with the NIST 'SRP upgrade kit' in the BIPM laboratories. The effect of this upgrade is reported here.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
