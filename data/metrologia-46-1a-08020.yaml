    <p>After the successful completion of the pilot study, CCQM-P65 [1], the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM agreed to conduct key comparison CCQM-K57, Chemical composition of clay, in Paris, April 2006. The natural mass fraction levels of five elements—Si, Ca, Fe, Al and Mg—were measured and reported as oxides in clay. Six national metrology institutes participated in CCQM K57, and CENAM (Querétaro, Mexico) coordinated.</p><p>The methods employed were isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using the dehydration method and condensation method, gravimetric analysis, neutron activation analysis (NAA), prompt gamma activation analysis (PGAA) and x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) with the reconstitution method and external calibration.</p><p>This final report presents the capability of the participant institutes, based on the KCRV, which was approved at the IAWG spring meeting in 2008, and the equivalence statements regarding the KCRV, approved at its autumn meeting.</p><p>Main text.
