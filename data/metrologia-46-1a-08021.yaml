abstract:
- content: "<p>Key comparison CCQM-K61 was performed to demonstrate and document the
    capability of interested national metrology institutes in the determination of
    the quantity of specific DNA target in an aqueous solution. The study provides
    support for the following measurement claim:</p><p>\"Quantitation of a linearised
    plasmid DNA, based on a matched standard in a matrix of non-target DNA\".</p><p>The
    comparison was an activity of the Bioanalysis Working Group (BAWG) of the Comité
    Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière and was coordinated by NIST (Gaithersburg,
    USA) and LGC (Teddington, UK).</p><p>The following laboratories (in alphabetical
    order) participated in this key comparison. \nDMSC (Thailand); IRMM (European
    Union); KRISS (Republic of Korea); LGC (UK); NIM\n(China); NIST (USA); NMIA (Australia);
    NMIJ (Japan); VNIIM (Russian Federation)</p><p>Good agreement was observed between
    the reported results of all nine of the participants. Uncertainty estimates did
    not account fully for the dispersion of results even after allowance for possible
    inhomogeneity in calibration materials. Preliminary studies suggest that the effects
    of fluorescence threshold setting might contribute to the excess dispersion, and
    further study of this topic is suggested</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main text
    of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
