    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K20 was performed to demonstrate the capability of the participating national metrology institutes (NMIs) to measure the pH value of an unknown potassium tetroxalate buffer by the primary method. The buffer of nominal pH ~ 1.7 was measured at three temperatures: 15 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C. The comparison was an activity of the Electrochemical Working Group (EAWG) of the CCQM and was coordinated by NIST (USA).

    All participants applied the primary method for pH. The result for the unknown buffer solution is the acidity function at zero chloride molality. Values for the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and its uncertainty, and the degrees of equivalence (D<sub>i</sub>) are reported. Good agreement of the results was observed for the majority of participants.</p><p>Main text.
