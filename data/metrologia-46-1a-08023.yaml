    <p>The CCQM-K64 study was performed to demonstrate and document the measurement capabilities of national metrology institutes in the determination of main and minor elements in copper alloys. The key comparison was coordinated by BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Berlin, Germany as an activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM. Elements to be determined were Cu, Pb, Sn, Fe and Ni in a lead-containing brass. Five national metrology institutes registered to participate in CCQM-K64. Three of them analysed all five elements requested, two of them did not perform analyses for tin. The participants used different analytical methods: all of them seem to be suitable, especially for Cu determination.</p><p>The BAM reference material AKP 220/2 Special Brass (unknown to the participants) was used as a test sample in this study.</p><p>CCQM-K64 demonstrates the abilities of metrological institutes to measure the mass fractions of main, minor and trace components of a copper alloy for copper (main element, &gt;50% mass fraction), lead (minor element, 1% to 5% mass fraction) and iron, nickel and, with reservations, tin (as trace components, 0.01% to 0.5% mass fraction). Only three of the five participants determined tin.</p><p>The analytical methods used were electrogravimetry (for copper and lead), flame-AAS and ICP-MS.</p><p>The scope of the key comparison extends to other copper alloys comprising the same or similar constituents and other elements in the same mass fraction range when analysed using the technique(s) applied in CCQM-64. It extends also to other non-ferrous metal alloys if the sample preparation is similar.</p><p>Main text.
