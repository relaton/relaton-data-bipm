    <p>The first regional key comparison in vibration conducted under the auspices of the Inter American System of Metrology (SIM) was begun in 1996. The comparison was registered with the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) through the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) under the key comparison designation of SIM.AUV.V K1. The national measurement institutes (NMIs) of five countries participating in SIM performed and reported calibrations of one back-to-back and two single-ended accelerometers for this comparison during the time period of 1997 to 1999. The participants in the comparison were: Argentina (INTI), Brazil (INMETRO), Canada (NRC), Mexico (CENAM) and the United States (NIST). Reference Values (RVs) were established for the SIM.AUV.V-K1 comparison using maximum likelihood consensus estimation applied to the summary values of charge sensitivity with the nominal numbers of repeat measurements reported by the participating NMIs. Degrees of equivalence between the results reported by the NMIs and the RVs as well as pairwise degrees of equivalence between the results reported by the NMIs were computed using the uncertainties associated with the results reported by the NMIs and those of the RVs as appropriate. Transformation values were found in order to link the results of SIM.AUV.V-K1 with those of the first international key comparison in vibration conducted under the auspices of the CCAUV during 1999 to 2001 (CCAUV.V-K1). The degrees of equivalence between the NMIs participating in SIM.AUV.V-K1 and those participating in CCAUV.V-K1 were established using linkage values computed from the transformation values.</p><p>Main text.
