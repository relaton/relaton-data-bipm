- content: |-
    <p>A bilateral comparison of the pressure sensitivity calibration of an LS1P microphone has been performed between the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, Korea) and the Research and Development Center for Calibration Instrumentation and Metrology (KIM-LIPI, Indonesia) in 2008. The KRISS was the pilot laboratory and the results of the KIM-LIPI have been linked to those of the  CCAUV.A-K1 comparison through the KRISS. The degree of equivalence of KIM-LIPI with respect to the KCRV is given at each of the measured frequencies.</p><p>Main text.
