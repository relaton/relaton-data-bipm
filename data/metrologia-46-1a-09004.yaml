    <p>A regional key comparison on primary standards for sound in air, COOMET.AUV.A-K1, based on pressure reciprocity calibration of laboratory standard microphones, was held in 2002. The results were submitted to and approved by the CCAUV in October 2008. Six national metrology institutes took part and the results of five of the laboratories have been linked to the corresponding  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/09002/">CCAUV.A-K1</ext-link> comparison. A generalized least squares approach was used to determine the degrees of equivalence for 14 acoustic frequencies and the results demonstrate agreement within the stated uncertainties.</p>
