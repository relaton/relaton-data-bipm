abstract:
- content: "<p>A bilateral comparison of primary standards for sound in air, COOMET.AUV.A-K1.1
    was conducted in 2004 between the DNDI (Ukraine) and the PTB (Germany) with PTB
    acting as the linking laboratory to the previous   COOMET.AUV.A-K1  comparison.
    A similar protocol was followed, and although measurements were made at 23 acoustic
    frequencies, the results were analysed in terms of degrees of equivalence only
    at the recommended frequencies of the   CCAUV.A-K1  comparison so that the appropriate
    links could be made. The results were approved by CCAUV in October 2008 are in
    agreement with all the linked results within the uncertainties.</p><p> Main text.
