    <p>A bilateral comparison of primary standards for sound in air, COOMET.AUV.A-K1.1 was conducted in 2004 between the DNDI (Ukraine) and the PTB (Germany) with PTB acting as the linking laboratory to the previous  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/46/1A/09004">COOMET.AUV.A-K1</ext-link> comparison. A similar protocol was followed, and although measurements were made at 23 acoustic frequencies, the results were analysed in terms of degrees of equivalence only at the recommended frequencies of the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/09002/">CCAUV.A-K1</ext-link> comparison so that the appropriate links could be made. The results were approved by CCAUV in October 2008 are in agreement with all the linked results within the uncertainties.</p>
