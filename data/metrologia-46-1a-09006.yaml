    <p>A low-frequency, acoustics key comparison has been conducted by the CCAUV for the first time. There were nine participants from three different regional metrology organizations, which will enable regional comparisons to be linked to this CIPM key comparison. The measurements have been analysed, a key comparison reference value evaluated and the results are presented together with their degrees of equivalence in the format compatible with publication in the BIPM key comparison database. There is reasonable agreement between all the results, within the stated uncertainties, and consistency has been demonstrated between these results and those of the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/09002/">CCAUV.A-K1</ext-link> comparison.</p>
