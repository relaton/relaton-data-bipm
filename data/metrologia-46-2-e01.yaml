abstract:
- content: "<p>This special issue of Metrologia on radiation dosimetry is the second
    in a trilogy on the subject of ionizing radiation measurements, a field that is
    overseen by Sections I, II and III of the CIPM's Consultative Committee for Ionizing
    Radiation (CCRI). The work of Section II, on radionuclide metrology, was covered
    in issue 44(4), published in 2007, and that of Section III, on neutron metrology,
    will be covered in a special issue to be published shortly. This issue covers
    the work of Section I (x-rays and Î³ rays, and charged particles).</p><p>The proposal
    to publish special issues of Metrologia covering the work of the CCRI Sections
    was first made in 2003 and refined at the two subsequent meetings of the CCRI
    in 2005 and 2007. The overall aim is to present the work of the CCRI to a wider
    metrological audience and to highlight the relevance and importance of the field.
    The main focus of our special issue on dosimetry metrology is on the 'state of
    the art' in the various areas covered, with an indication of the current developments
    taking place and the problems and challenges that remain. Where appropriate, this
    is set in a brief historical context, although it is not the aim to give a historical
    review.</p><p>The need for accurate measurement has been appreciated from the
    pioneering days of the use of ionizing radiation in the early 20th century, particularly
    in the fields of diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. Over the years, the range
    of applications for ionizing radiation has expanded both in scope and in the types
    and energies of radiation employed. This has led to the need to develop a wide
    variety of measurement techniques and standards covering fields ranging from the
    low doses experienced in environmental and protection applications to the extremely
    high doses used in industrial processing. The different types of radiation employed
    give rise to the need for dose measurements in radiation beams whose effective
    penetration through a material such as water ranges from a few micrometres to
    several metres.</p><p>The wide variety of radiation types and dose ranges posed
    a particular problem in selecting the topics to be included in this special issue
    and has inevitably meant that some fields of application have received less attention
    than others. It is hoped, however, that the topics covered are broad and varied
    enough to provide useful information for those with an interest in radiation dosimetry,
    both experienced practitioners and those entering the field. The extensive reference
    lists also provide a valuable resource.</p><p>The issue begins with the important
    topic of mutual recognition of dosimetry standards and the procedures that have
    been put in place to achieve this, and continues with contributions on the principal
    measurement techniques employed: free-air chambers, air-kerma cavity standards,
    photon absorbed-dose standards and absorbed-dose standards for electron beams.
    The topics of brachytherapy and radiation protection dosimetry are covered in
    separate articles, and the issue concludes with a review of the mathematical modelling
    techniques that underpin much of the recent work described in the preceding sections.</p><p>The
    work involved in the production of a document such as this is considerable and
    we have been extremely fortunate in securing the involvement of many of the acknowledged
    experts in the field of ionizing radiation dosimetry, both as named authors and
    serving as anonymous referees. The editors would like to thank all those who have
    given their time and commitment to producing this special issue, and particularly
    Professor Georgio Moscati, former President of the CCRI, and Dr Penny Allisy-Roberts,
    Executive Secretary of the CCRI, for their support and encouragement.</p>"
