  content: "<p>An overview of the international framework that supports the dissemination
    of the dosimetry quantities for ionizing radiation is presented. The aim of international
    traceability is for confidence in such measurements around the world, which is
    particularly important for the equivalence of patient treatment regimes as required
    in international clinical trials for radiotherapy but also for fields as diverse
    as industrial processing, diagnostic medicine and radiation protection. This paper
    gives some explanation of the comparison system for national primary standards
    in the field of dosimetry and shows how these can support the claims for the calibration
    and measurement capabilities of national metrology institutes represented in the
    BIPM key comparison database.</p>"
