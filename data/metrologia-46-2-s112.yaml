abstract:
- content: "<p>The physical principles and approximations employed in Monte Carlo
    simulations of coupled electron–photon transport are reviewed. After a brief analysis
    of the assumptions underlying the trajectory picture used to generate random particle
    histories, we concentrate on the physics of the various interaction processes
    of photons and electrons. For each of these processes we describe the theoretical
    models and approximations that lead to the differential cross sections employed
    in general-purpose Monte Carlo codes. References to relevant publications and
    data resources are also provided.</p>"
