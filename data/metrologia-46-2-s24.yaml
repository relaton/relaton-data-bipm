  content: "<p>This paper reviews the current status of air-kerma cavity standards
    for gamma rays from <sup>60</sup>Co, <sup>137</sup>Cs and <sup>192</sup>Ir sources.
    It describes the basic principles and the theories to determine the air-kerma
    rate from the ionization current of graphite-walled cavity ionization chambers.
    A typical design of a cavity chamber is shown and described. The various correction
    factors to be applied to the standards and their determination by experimental
    and Monte Carlo methods are discussed. A typical uncertainty budget for a cavity
    standard is presented and the results of comparisons between primary standards
    are summarized and discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and proposals made
    for topics to be addressed in future studies.</p>"
