abstract:
- content: "<p>In this review the current status of absorbed dose to water standards
    for high-energy photon beams (<sup>60</sup>Co—50 MV nominal accelerating potential)
    is discussed. The review is focused on calorimeter-based absorbed dose standards
    for photon radiation therapy calibrations with typical dose rates of a few gray
    per minute. In addition, two alternative types of absorbed dose standards are
    also discussed. The overall uncertainty on measured dose to water in static reference
    fields is nowadays on the order of 0.4% to 0.5%. The components contributing to
    the uncertainty budgets are discussed. The discussed absorbed dose to water standards
    are expected to continue to have their place not only in the dissemination of
    absorbed dose to water but also in the determination of beam quality conversion
    factors essential in reference dosimetry in high-energy photon beams.</p>"
