  content: "<p>The development of primary standards of absorbed dose for electron
    beams has lagged somewhat the development of photon beam standards. However, this
    has not limited the diversity of designs, or the range of applications. This review
    describes the state-of-the-art in electron beam standards as practised today in
    a number of primary standards laboratories and research institutions around the
    world. The devices detailed cover electron energies from 80 keV to 25 MeV and
    doses from 1 Gy to tens of kilogray, although the focus of the majority of research
    is on dosimetry for radiation therapy.</p>"
