  content: "<p>Current primary standards for the calibration of both photon and beta
    particle emitting brachytherapy sources are reviewed. Methods for quality control
    being used as well as methods of transferring these standards to secondary laboratories
    and users are also discussed. Finally, dosimetry protocols for brachytherapy sources
    are described.</p>"
