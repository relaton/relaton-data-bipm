abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements for radiation protection dosimetry in medicine, industry,
    science and in the environment require instruments for photon, beta and neutron
    radiation and for combinations of them. To characterize and calibrate such instruments
    reference radiation fields are required, together with the dosimetry of these
    fields and the methods to calibrate the instruments. For all these tasks standards
    are available; an overview of them is given in this paper. In addition, an overview
    of secondary standard instruments is provided which serve as a tool to ensure
    the traceability between the primary standards laboratories and the calibrating
    and type testing laboratories. The part on neutrons is kept short as neutrons
    will be dealt with in a future special issue in this journal.</p><p>About 10 years
    ago, Böhm et al (1999 Radiat. Prot. Dosim. 86 87–105) summarized the ISO recommended
    reference radiations used in radiation protection. This paper updates that review
    and adds environmental radiation and secondary standard instruments.</p>"
