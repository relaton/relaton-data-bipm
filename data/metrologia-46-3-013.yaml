abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent supplement to the GUM (GUM S1) is compared with a Bayesian
    analysis in terms of a particular task of data analysis, one where no prior knowledge
    of the measurand is presumed. For the Bayesian analysis, an improper prior density
    on the measurand is employed. It is shown that both approaches yield the same
    results when the measurand depends linearly on the input quantities, but generally
    different results otherwise. This difference is shown to be not a conceptual one,
    but due to the fact that the two methods correspond to Bayesian analysis under
    different parametrizations, with ignorance of the measurand expressed by a non-informative
    prior on a different parameter. The use of the improper prior for the measurand
    itself may result in an improper posterior probability density function (PDF)
    when the measurand depends non-linearly on the input quantities. On the other
    hand, the PDF of the measurand derived by the GUM supplement method is always
    proper but may sometimes have undesirable properties such as non-existence of
    moments.</p><p>It is concluded that for a linear model both analyses can safely
    be applied. For a non-linear model, the GUM supplement approach may be preferred
    over a Bayesian analysis using a constant prior on the measurand. But since in
    this case the GUM S1 PDF may also have undesirable properties, and as often some
    prior knowledge about the measurand may be established, metrologists are strongly
    encouraged to express this prior knowledge in terms of a proper PDF which can
    then be included in a Bayesian analysis. The results of this paper are illustrated
    by an example of a simple non-linear model.</p>"
