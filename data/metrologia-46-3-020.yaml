abstract:
- content: "<p>The texture of surfaces within a piston–cylinder assembly (PCA) can
    influence the pressure performance of gas-operated dead weight pressure balances
    (DWPBs). In order to systematically study this response, it has been necessary
    to design, develop and manufacture uniquely interchangeable 35 mm diameter PCAs
    for use in a novel hybrid gas-operated DWPB with high mechanical, thermal and
    pressure stability. This work reports the development of the PCAs and the validation
    of the DWPB design, allowing the performance characteristics of the interchangeable
    PCAs to be understood, in terms of variations of effective area calculations.
    This is achieved by investigating the pressure responses of the DWPBs by changing
    the speed and direction of rotation. The results demonstrate the stability of
    the gas-operated DWPB design when used in gauge mode, and importantly allow the
    verification of the performance of the interchangeable PCAs.</p>"
