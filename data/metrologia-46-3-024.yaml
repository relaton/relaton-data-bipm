abstract:
- content: "<p>A generalized statistical approach for interlaboratory comparisons
    with linear trends is proposed. This new approach can be applied to the general
    case when the artefacts are measured and reported multiple times in each participating
    laboratory. The advantages of this approach are that it is consistent with the
    previous approaches when only the pilot lababoratory makes multiple measurements
    and it applies whether or not there exists a trend. The uncertainties for the
    comparison reference value and the degree of equivalence are also provided. As
    an illustration, the method is applied to the SIM.EM-K2 comparison for resistance
    at the level of 1 GΩ.</p>"
