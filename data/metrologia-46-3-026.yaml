abstract:
- content: "<p>The Metrology Light Source (MLS), the electron storage ring of the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), is operated as a primary radiometric
    source standard from the near infrared (NIR) to the vacuum ultraviolet spectral
    region with calculable synchrotron radiation according to electromagnetic theory
    (Schwinger equation). The operational parameters of the MLS can be varied in a
    wide range to adjust the spectral distribution and the intensity of the resulting
    spectrum to the specific measurement requirements. The electron beam energy can
    be set to values between 105 MeV and 630 MeV, and the electron beam current can
    be varied from 1 pA (one stored electron) up to 200 mA.</p><p>Using two calibrated
    filter radiometers with centre wavelengths of 476 nm and 1595 nm as transfer standards,
    the calculated spectral radiant power of the MLS into a well-defined aperture
    was compared with the spectral irradiance responsivity scale of PTB realized by
    cryogenic radiometers in the visible and NIR spectral range. The measurements
    were performed with the MLS operated at various electron energies. Good agreement
    was found within the combined relative uncertainties.</p>"
