abstract:
- content: "<p>The law of propagation of uncertainty requires the proper treatment
    of dependence between the estimates of quantities influencing the measurement.
    Sometimes these estimates are themselves obtained in previous separate measurements,
    and the correlation between these estimates is not recorded. In such a case, the
    corresponding correlation coefficient or covariance will wrongly be deemed to
    be zero. In other situations, the number of input or output quantities might be
    large and information about dependence might not be recorded because of the apparent
    need for the construction of a large matrix of covariances. This paper presents
    (i) a method whereby information about dependence is recorded in a table with,
    typically, fewer columns than the matrix and (ii) a corresponding re-expression
    of the law of propagation of uncertainty. Examples of the application of the method
    are given.</p>"
