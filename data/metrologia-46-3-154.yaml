abstract:
- content: "<p>Ideally, the output of one calculation of measurement uncertainty should
    be usable as an input to another calculation. This paper describes (i) how the
    output distribution of a Monte Carlo (MC) evaluation of uncertainty can be summarized
    for use in another analysis and (ii) how a general probability distribution can
    be summarized for efficient use as an MC input distribution. The principal technique
    discussed involves fitting an asymmetric form of ‘lambda distribution’ to the
    summarizing data. This distribution is defined by the inverse of its distribution
    function, so the generation of random samples from this distribution is straightforward.</p><p>The
    inverse of the distribution function is known as the ‘quantile function’. The
    principle advocated is that of working with distributions with convenient quantile
    functions instead of distributions with convenient probability density functions.
    This principle is applicable whether the distributions represent sampling distributions,
    as in frequentist statistics, or patterns of belief, as in Bayesian statistics.</p>"
