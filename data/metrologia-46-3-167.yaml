  content: "<p>Maxwell's equations in the context of Floquet's theorem for construction
    of a sequence of periodic precision air lines with surface roughness and ohmic
    resistance in the conductor walls offer a solution for finding the propagation
    constants in correspondence to the principal transverse magnetic mode. Boundary
    conditions to define surface roughness and ohmic wall loss through a tangent surface
    vector expression to incorporate composite axial and radial electromagnetic field
    components enable the construction of a system determinant to extract the propagation
    constant.</p>"
