abstract:
- content: "<p>A method is presented that can be used for the evaluation of the value
    of the Earth gravity field at any defined position inside or outside an instrument
    used for physical or metrological experiments. After a brief presentation of the
    gravimeters used and the evaluation of their respective uncertainties, we describe
    in detail the procedure developed to determine the gravitational acceleration
    g at the point of interest. Finally, a realistic evaluation of the uncertainty
    budget shows that the method can be used in many metrological applications and
    especially in all experiments aiming at a new definition of the kilogram by virtual
    comparison of mechanical and electromagnetic power.</p><p>In this paper, we denote
    with g the Earth gravity field or gravitational acceleration, which is the sum
    of all accelerations felt by a free falling body at the surface of the Earth.</p>"
