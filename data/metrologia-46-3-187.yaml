abstract:
- content: "<p>We revisited the treatment of the influence of the support conditions
    and the resulting bending of a scale on the positions of its graduation lines.
    In contrast to earlier publications, we did not calculate the position deviation
    with respect to the case without any bending. Due to the production processes
    used today, this is inappropriate and leads to an overestimation of the related
    uncertainty contribution. We also extended the treatment from two lines to all
    lines of the scale and included a finite starting point of the graduation. We
    verified our analytical model by means of FEM calculations. In addition, we showed
    that a first order Taylor expansion yields sufficiently accurate results for the
    position deviations and leads to simple equations for their size. Because line
    scale measurements are related to the zero line the constant term of the Taylor
    expansion cancels and the remaining coefficient is identical to the sensitivity
    coefficient required in the determination of the standard uncertainty contribution.
    If it is sufficient to suppress the position dependence and to consider only the
    case where the sample is supported at symmetric positions, then a new, simple
    equation is obtained for the resulting uncertainty contribution. Finally we showed
    that due to the position dependence of the deviations the scale coefficient of
    the scale, which is obtained by a linear fit to the deviations of the line positions
    of the scale from their nominal values, is also influenced, which has apparently
    not been noticed up to now. If the line standard used to disseminate the unit
    of length has not been designed carefully then the resulting change in the scale
    coefficient exposes a practical limit to the related achievable length-dependent
    uncertainty contribution.</p>"
