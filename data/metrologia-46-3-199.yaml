abstract:
- content: "<p>A review of the state of the art of electrochemical methods at the
    highest metrology level in national metrology institutes (NMIs) is given, with
    emphasis on standardization work (primary methods) in the fields of pH and electrolytic
    conductivity, as well as use of coulometry. Attention is also given to certain
    technical issues in the implementation of these methods.</p>"
