    <p>Since the 1st International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG) and accompanying Relative Gravity Campaign (RGC) held at the BIPM in 1981, repeated ICAG-RGCs have been organized every four years. A total of 19 absolute gravimeters (AG) and 15 relative gravimeters (RG) participated in the 7th ICAG-RGC, which took place in 2005. Co-located absolute and relative gravity measurements as well as precision levelling measurements were carried out.</p>
    <p>The final version of the absolute <italic>g</italic> values of the 7th ICAG has been officially released recently. This paper is the final report of the 7th RGC and replaces the preliminary results published earlier. It covers the organization of the RGC and the data processing, analyses RG behaviour, computes <italic>g</italic>, δ<italic>g</italic> and <italic>O</italic><sub>AG</sub> (offset of AG) and discusses their uncertainties. In preparation for the BIPM key comparison ICAG-2009, a standard data-processing procedure has been developed and installed in the BIPM ICAG-RGC software package, GraviSoft. This was used for the final data processing.</p>
