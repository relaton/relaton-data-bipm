  content: "<p>We report on Korea's first optically pumped primary frequency standard
    (KRISS-1) developed at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science.
    Although a relatively small microwave cavity (the cavity drift region is about
    36 cm in length) has been employed in this experiment, we achieved our desired
    frequency accuracy by applying the regularized inverse on the Ramsey spectrum
    analysis and compensating the effect of the evanescent field inside the cavity.
    KRISS-1 typically performs at a short term stability of \n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro298606in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>
    with a combined uncertainty of 1.0 × 10<sup>−14</sup>.</p>"
