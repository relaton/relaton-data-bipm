abstract:
- content: "<p>Uncertainty evaluations for kinematic viscosity measurements using
    a series of capillary master viscometers are given, based on model equations considering
    precise corrections for the U-tube-type viscometers used at the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan (NMIJ). Results of viscometer constant calibrations for the
    NMIJ viscosity scale calibrated by stepping up to high viscosities, and the kinematic
    viscosity measurements of standard liquids with master viscometers at temperatures
    from −40 °C up to 100 °C, are evaluated in detail. The relative expanded uncertainties
    at k = 2 for kinematic viscosity measurements of standard liquids are 0.04% to
    0.17% in the viscosity range up to 160 000 mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.</p>"
