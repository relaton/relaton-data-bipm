abstract:
- content: "<p>After the Gaussian distribution, the probability distribution most
    commonly used in evaluation of uncertainty in measurement is the rectangular distribution.
    If the half-width of a rectangular distribution is specified, the mid-point is
    uncertain, and the probability distribution of the mid-point may be represented
    by another (narrower) rectangular distribution then the resulting distribution
    is an isosceles trapezoidal distribution. However, in metrological applications,
    it is more common that the mid-point is specified but the half-width is uncertain.
    If the probability distribution of the half-width may be represented by another
    (narrower) rectangular distribution, then the resulting distribution looks like
    an isosceles trapezoid whose sloping sides are curved. We can refer to such a
    probability distribution as an isocurvilinear trapezoidal distribution. We describe
    the main characteristics of an isocurvilinear trapezoidal distribution which arises
    when the half-width is uncertain. When the uncertainty in specification of the
    half-width is not excessive, the isocurvilinear trapezoidal distribution can be
    approximated by an isosceles trapezoidal distribution.</p>"
