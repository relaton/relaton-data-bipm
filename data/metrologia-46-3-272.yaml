abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Systematic errors due to evanescent field inside an <italic>E</italic>-plane
    type Ramsey cavity are corrected by introducing an extended square pulse profile
    in our Ramsey spectral analysis. This procedure is crucial for the proper operation
    of thermal beam based atomic frequency standards with short cavities. By accounting
    for the spatial extent of the field inside the cavity, the method enables a correct
    calculation of transition probability for atoms at the interaction region. The
    authors demonstrate that the systematic errors in quadratic Doppler and end-to-end
    cavity phase shifts can be reduced by an order of magnitude.</p>"
