abstract:
- content: "<p>Systematic errors due to evanescent field inside an E-plane type Ramsey
    cavity are corrected by introducing an extended square pulse profile in our Ramsey
    spectral analysis. This procedure is crucial for the proper operation of thermal
    beam based atomic frequency standards with short cavities. By accounting for the
    spatial extent of the field inside the cavity, the method enables a correct calculation
    of transition probability for atoms at the interaction region. The authors demonstrate
    that the systematic errors in quadratic Doppler and end-to-end cavity phase shifts
    can be reduced by an order of magnitude.</p>"
