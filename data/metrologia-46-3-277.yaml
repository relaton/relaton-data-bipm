  content: "<p>A new differential nanoforce facility, based on a disc-pendulum with
    electrostatic stiffness reduction and an electrostatic force compensation for
    the measurement of horizontal forces in the range below 1 µN, is presented. First
    measurements in air over an averaging time of 50 s show a noise level of the facility
    of 42 pN. The method and the results of measuring the light pressure of a red
    He–Ne laser with a power of 7 mW (<italic>F</italic><sub>L</sub> = 47 pN) are
    presented. The force measurement uncertainty of the device is below 5%, for a
    force to be measured of 1 nN and a measuring duration of 50 s.</p>"
