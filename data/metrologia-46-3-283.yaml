abstract:
- content: "<p>The design and first results of two free-fall absolute gravimeters
    are reported: a stationary gravimeter is designed and can be used as a reference
    system and a portable gravimeter is aimed at field measurements.</p><p>The determination
    of the acceleration due to gravity is done interferometrically in both instruments.
    The whole fringe signal is digitized by a high-speed analogue-to-digital converter,
    which is locked to a rubidium frequency standard. This fringe recording and processing
    is novel as compared with commercial free-fall gravimeters, which use an electronic
    zero-crossing discrimination. Advantages such as the application of a zero-phase-shifting
    digital filter to the digitized data are depicted. The portable gravimeter's mechanics
    deviate from the conventional type. Springs are used to accelerate and decelerate
    the carriage supporting the falling object.</p><p>A detailed uncertainty budget
    is given for both gravimeters. The combined standard uncertainty for the portable
    and for the stationary gravimeter is estimated at 38.8 µGal and 16.6 µGal, respectively.
    The corresponding statistical uncertainties are 1.6 µGal (over one day of measurement)
    and 0.6 µGal (over one month of measurement).</p><p>The different designs and
    dimensions of the new free-fall gravimeters can help to reveal unknown or so far
    underestimated systematic effects. The assessments of the uncertainties due to
    seismic noise and shock vibrations, and electronic phase shifts give validity
    to this assumption.</p>"
