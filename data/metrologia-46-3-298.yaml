abstract:
- content: "<p>The method for realization of the kilogram using ‘superconducting magnetic
    levitation’ was re-evaluated at MIKES. The realization of the kilogram based on
    the traditional levitation method is limited by the imperfections of the superconducting
    materials and the indefinable dependence between supplied electrical energy and
    the gravitational potential energy of the superconducting mass. This indefiniteness
    is proportional to the applied magnetic field and is caused by increasing losses
    and trapped magnetic fluxes. A new design of an electromechanical system for the
    levitation method is proposed. In the proposed system the required magnetic field
    and the corresponding force are reduced, as the mass of the body (hanging from
    a mass comparator) is compensated by the reference weight on the mass comparator.
    The direction of the magnetic force can be upward (levitation force, when the
    body is over the coil) or downward (repulsive force, when the body is under the
    coil). The initial force to move the body from the coil is not needed and magnetic
    field sensitivity is increased, providing linearization of displacement versus
    applied current. This new construction allows a lower magnetic induction, reduces
    energy losses compared with previous designs of electromechanical system and reduces
    the corresponding systematic error.</p>"
