  content: "<p>The usefulness of weighted means statistics as a consensus mean estimator
    in collaborative studies is discussed. A random effects model designed to combine
    information from several sources is employed to justify their appeal to metrologists.
    Some methods of estimating the uncertainties and of constructing confidence intervals
    are reviewed.</p>"
