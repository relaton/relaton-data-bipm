  content: "<p>There has been considerable discussion about the merits of redefining
    four of the base units of the SI, including the mole. In this paper, the options
    for implementing a new definition for the mole based on a fixed value for the
    Avogadro constant are discussed. They are placed in the context of the macroscopic
    nature of the quantity amount of substance and the opportunity to introduce a
    system for molar and atomic masses with unchanged values and consistent relative
    uncertainties.</p>"
