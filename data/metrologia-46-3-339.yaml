  content: "<p>This paper describes a new approach to link air and vacuum mass measurements
    using magnetic levitation techniques. This procedure provides direct traceability
    to national standards, presently defined in ambient air. We describe the basic
    principles, challenges, initial modelling calculations and performance expectations.</p>"
