    <bold>43</bold> L56â€“61</ext-link>) is an alternative computational procedure to
    the Law of Propagation of Uncertainty (LPU) described in the <italic>Guide to
    the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>. One advantage of the method
    is that data processing can be carried out in an arbitrary series of steps and
    much of the mathematical analysis normally associated with the LPU can be automated
    by software. This has applications for measuring systems, which are modular in
    design and use internal data processing to apply corrections to raw data. Several
    scenarios involving radio frequency power measurements are used to illustrate
    the new method in this context. The scenarios show something of the difficulty
    inherent in calculating uncertainty for modern measurement systems and in particular
    highlight the occurrence of systematic errors arising from internal instrument
    correction factors. Such errors introduce correlation to a series of measurements
    and must be handled with care when functions of results, such as means, differences
    and ratios, are required.</p>
