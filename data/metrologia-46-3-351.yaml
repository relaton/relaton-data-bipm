abstract:
- content: "<p>The uncertain-numbers method (Hall B D 2006 Metrologia 43 L56â€“61) is
    an alternative computational procedure to the Law of Propagation of Uncertainty
    (LPU) described in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.
    One advantage of the method is that data processing can be carried out in an arbitrary
    series of steps and much of the mathematical analysis normally associated with
    the LPU can be automated by software. This has applications for measuring systems,
    which are modular in design and use internal data processing to apply corrections
    to raw data. Several scenarios involving radio frequency power measurements are
    used to illustrate the new method in this context. The scenarios show something
    of the difficulty inherent in calculating uncertainty for modern measurement systems
    and in particular highlight the occurrence of systematic errors arising from internal
    instrument correction factors. Such errors introduce correlation to a series of
    measurements and must be handled with care when functions of results, such as
    means, differences and ratios, are required.</p>"
