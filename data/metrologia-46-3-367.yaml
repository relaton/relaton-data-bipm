  content: "<p>This work presents the uncertainties in the effective radiating area
    (<italic>A</italic><sub>ER</sub>) and beam non-uniformity ratio (<italic>R</italic><sub>BN</sub>)
    for ultrasound (US) transducers in the range of 1.0 MHz to 3.5 MHz, and for head
    diameters of 1.27 cm and 2.54 cm. Measurements were performed using the US pressure
    field mapping system developed at the Laboratory of Ultrasound located at the
    Brazilian National Metrology Institute, which provides national traceability for
    the assessed quantities. The calculation protocol was developed based on Standard
    IEC 61689:2007. The type A uncertainty was estimated from four repetitions of
    the full measurement procedure for determinations of <italic>A</italic><sub>ER</sub>
    and <italic>R</italic><sub>BN</sub>, and the type B uncertainty was estimated
    from mathematical models for both parameters, based on IEC 61689:2007 and the
    ISO ‘<italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>’.
    The maximum combined expanded uncertainties (95% confidence level) were 6.8% for
    <italic>A</italic><sub>ER</sub> and 14.9% for <italic>R</italic><sub>BN</sub>.</p>"
