abstract:
- content: "<p>Quantitation of the trace amount of DNA by counting individual DNA
    molecules using a high-sensitivity flow cytometric setup has been developed and
    evaluated for the purpose of establishing a reference analytical procedure. Model
    DNA molecules, represented by lambda (λ) viral DNA (48 502 bp, double-stranded),
    were electro-focused to form a tightly bound flow stream on a detection point
    situated on the centre axis of fused silica tubing measuring 50 µm × 50 µm. The
    individual DNA particles that were stained with a fluorescent dye were detected
    individually with a high-sensitivity laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection
    system. Assuming all DNA particles in a given sample volume were detected and
    counted (‘exhaustive counting’), its molar concentration can be calculated without
    the need for calibration materials. The validity of the proposed measurement method
    was thoroughly examined and discussed.</p>"
