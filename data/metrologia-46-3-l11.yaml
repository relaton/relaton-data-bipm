abstract:
- content: "<p>The third edition of the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM)
    has introduced the concept of kind of quantity as the ‘aspect common to mutually
    comparable quantities’. While the concept is a fundamental one, as it is relevantly
    used in several definitions throughout VIM, its definition is critical for several
    reasons. Not only is the division of the concept of ‘quantity’ according to ‘kind
    of quantity’ to some extent arbitrary, as noted in the Vocabulary, but also the
    distinction between the concepts of ‘quantity’ and ‘kind of quantity’ is to some
    extent arbitrary. This article discusses this subject and suggests a possible
    solution to some of the issues identified.</p>"
