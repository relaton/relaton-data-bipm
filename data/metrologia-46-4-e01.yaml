abstract:
- content: "<p>This special issue of Metrologia contains selected papers from the
    NEWRAD 2008 Conference, held in Daejeon, Korea, on 12–16 October 2008. NEWRAD
    2008 continues a series of conferences on radiometry entitled 'New Developments
    and Applications in Optical Radiometry', which have taken place as follows:</p><p>Cambridge,
    MA, USA (1985) \nTeddington, UK (1988) \nDavos, Switzerland (1990) \nBaltimore,
    MD, USA (1992) \nBerlin, Germany (1994) \nTucson, AZ, USA (1997) \nMadrid, Spain
    (1999) \nGaithersburg, MD, USA (2002) \nDavos, Switzerland (2005) \nDaejeon, Korea
    (2008)</p><p>As the first NEWRAD Conference arranged in Asia, NEWRAD 2008 opened
    a new era for this series of conferences. The conference was followed by a Workshop
    on High Temperature Fixed Points and meetings of the Working Groups of the Consultative
    Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR). The organizer of all these events
    was Dr In Won Lee of the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS).
    The NEWRAD Scientific Committee thanks him and his team for their tremendous efforts
    which maintained and developed the high standards of previous NEWRAD Conferences.</p><p>The
    specific themes of NEWRAD 2008 included optical measurements related to displays,
    energy and terahertz applications. Furthermore, half a day of sessions was devoted
    to both remote sensing and to few-photon sources and detectors. A total of 140
    papers were presented, including 11 invited and 30 contributed talks. The conference
    proceedings containing two-page extended abstracts were distributed to the participants
    as a paper volume and on a USB memory stick. The authors of selected contributions
    were invited to submit a full paper for this special issue. The submitted papers
    were handled by the normal reviewing procedures of Metrologia. On behalf of the
    Scientific Committee, I thank the reviewers and editorial staff of Metrologia
    for careful processing of the manuscripts. It is evident that this special issue,
    like its predecessors, will serve as an important reference for radiometry for
    years to come.</p><p>The next conference in the series, NEWRAD 2011, will take
    place in Hawaii on 19–23 September 2011. The primary contact is Mark Yarbrough
    of the University of Hawaii Marine Center. Dr Yarbrough can be contacted via e-mail
    at yarbrough@mlml.calstate.edu.</p>"
