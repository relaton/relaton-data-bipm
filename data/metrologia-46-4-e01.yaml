  content: "<p>This special issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> contains selected
    papers from the NEWRAD 2008 Conference, held in Daejeon, Korea, on 12–16 October
    2008. NEWRAD 2008 continues a series of conferences on radiometry entitled 'New
    Developments and Applications in Optical Radiometry', which have taken place as
    follows:</p>\n<p>Cambridge, MA, USA (1985) \nTeddington, UK (1988) \nDavos, Switzerland
    (1990) \nBaltimore, MD, USA (1992) \nBerlin, Germany (1994)   \nTucson, AZ, USA
    (1997) \nMadrid, Spain (1999) \nGaithersburg, MD, USA (2002) \nDavos, Switzerland
    (2005) \nDaejeon, Korea (2008)</p>\n<p>As the first NEWRAD Conference arranged
    in Asia, NEWRAD 2008 opened a new era for this series of conferences. The conference
    was followed by a Workshop on High Temperature Fixed Points and meetings of the
    Working Groups of the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR).
    The organizer of all these events was Dr In Won Lee of the Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science (KRISS). The NEWRAD Scientific Committee thanks him and
    his team for their tremendous efforts which maintained and developed the high
    standards of previous NEWRAD Conferences.</p>\n<p>The specific themes of NEWRAD
    2008 included optical measurements related to displays, energy and terahertz applications.
    Furthermore, half a day of sessions was devoted to both remote sensing and to
    few-photon sources and detectors. A total of 140 papers were presented, including
    11 invited and 30 contributed talks. The conference proceedings containing two-page
    extended abstracts were distributed to the participants as a paper volume and
    on a USB memory stick. The authors of selected contributions were invited to submit
    a full paper for this special issue. The submitted papers were handled by the
    normal reviewing procedures of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>. On behalf of the
    Scientific Committee, I thank the reviewers and editorial staff of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>
    for careful processing of the manuscripts. It is evident that this special issue,
    like its predecessors, will serve as an important reference for radiometry for
    years to come.</p>\n<p>The next conference in the series, NEWRAD 2011, will take
    place in Hawaii on 19–23 September 2011. The primary contact is Mark Yarbrough
    of the University of Hawaii Marine Center. Dr Yarbrough can be contacted via e-mail
