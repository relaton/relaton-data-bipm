  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A near-IR radiometer standard with similar performance to silicon trap
    detectors has been developed to calibrate detectors and radiometers for absolute
    spectral power, irradiance and radiance responsivities between 950 nm and 1650 nm.
    The new radiometer standard is utilized at the Spectral Irradiance and Radiance
    Responsivity Calibrations using Uniform Sources (SIRCUS) which is the reference
    calibration facility of NIST for absolute responsivity. The radiometer standard
    is a sphere detector with a unique geometrical arrangement and it can convert
    the radiant power responsivity scale of the primary-standard cryogenic radiometer
    into a reference irradiance responsivity scale. The 0.05% (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2) scale conversion uncertainty is dominated by the two largest uncertainty
    components of the radiometer: the spatial non-uniformity of responsivity of less
    than 0.05% in power mode and the 0.03% angular responsivity deviation from the
    cosine function in a 5° angular range in irradiance mode. These small uncertainty
    components are the results of a tilted input aperture (relative to the sphere
    axis) and four symmetrically positioned InGaAs detectors around the incident beam
    spot in the sphere. With the new radiometer standard, it is expected that a thermodynamic
    temperature uncertainty of 10 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2) can be achieved at 157 °C,
    the freeze temperature of the In fixed-point blackbody.</p>"
