  content: "<p>Commercially available absolute cryogenic radiometers (ACRs) have combined
    uncertainties that grow rapidly above 1% (<italic>k</italic> = 1) at power levels
    below 10 nW. There are solid state detectors, however, used in sensors and radiometers
    that cannot be calibrated at levels as high as 10 nW because they begin to saturate.
    For this reason new detector-based standards are being developed to provide the
    low-background infrared calibration community with absolute traceability to powers
    down to 1 pW with ∼0.1% (<italic>k</italic> = 1) combined uncertainty. The scale
    will be established using an ACR with a combined uncertainty of the order of 1 fW
    and a trap detector based on arsenic-doped silicon blocked impurity band devices
    with similar noise floor performance.</p>"
