abstract:
- content: "<p>Calculations of reflectance required for designing a predictable quantum
    efficient detector (PQED) are presented. The PQED will be based on natural inversion
    layer photodiodes and it is expected to measure optical power with an uncertainty
    of 1 ppm. To achieve such a low level of uncertainty, the associated reflectance
    of the PQED must be of the same order of magnitude. The wavelength range from
    450 nm to 900 nm and the oxide layer thickness from 10 nm to 500 nm were used
    in the calculations of specular reflectance. The results show that a simple two-photodiode
    design is suitable for the PQED if scattering from the surface of the photodiode
    is less than 1 ppm. For higher scattering up to 100 ppm, a more advanced detector
    structure may allow control of this uncertainty component at the level of 1 ppm.</p>"
