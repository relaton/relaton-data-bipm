  content: "<p>Routine NIST spectral responsivity calibrations are needed for the
    infrared range. Low-NEP pyroelectric radiometers have been developed for traditional
    monochromator applications to extend the responsivity scale to the infrared. After
    NEP tests, the best pyroelectric detectors were converted to transfer-standard
    radiometers. The relative spectral responsivities were determined from spectral
    reflectance measurements of the organic black detector coatings. The absolute
    tie points were measured against a domed pyroelectric radiometer standard and
    a sphere-input extended-InGaAs transfer-standard radiometer. The infrared spectral
    power responsivity scale has been extended for the 2 µm to 14 µm wavelength range.
    A single-grating monochromator has been adapted to the calibration facility and
    used to characterize and calibrate infrared detectors.</p>"
