abstract:
- content: "<p>The spectral responsivity of the detector is important for the layout
    and quantitative interpretation of spectroscopic experiments. In the terahertz
    (THz) spectral range the knowledge of the total (integral) responsivity of a detector,
    as well as its spectral distribution, is often insufficient. PTB determined the
    spectral irradiance responsivity of two THz detectors, a pyroelectric DLATGS detector
    working at room temperature and a silicon-composite bolometer working at 4 K,
    in the wavelength range from 62 µm (4.82 THz) to 1340 µm (0.22 THz) with temperature
    radiation from blackbody radiators. Our approach is to use two THz cavity radiators
    in combination with THz bandpass filters to provide calculable spectral irradiances,
    according to Planck's law of radiation, at several wavelength bands in the THz
    spectral range. One cavity radiator is working at an adjustable fixed temperature
    in the range from 15 °C to 90 °C while the other cavity radiator operates at LN<sub>2</sub>
    temperature. The radiation of the two cavity radiators is alternately imaged on
    the detector via a gold-coated chopper wheel. Hereby the background radiation
    is cancelled and also the necessary modulation for the lock-in detection is provided.
    The cavity of the high temperature radiator is coated with a dedicated paint providing
    high wall emissivity in the FIR and THz spectral range to ensure true blackbody
    behaviour of the radiator. The bottom of the low temperature radiator consists
    of THz absorber foam providing hereby also nearly blackbody behaviour. All individual
    filters and, additionally, the employed filter combinations are characterized
    for their transmittance in the entire wavelength range from 0.8 µm to 1700 µm
    to obtain a precise knowledge of the transmitted blackbody spectrum. The very
    reproducible results indicate that this setup allows a fast, simple and reliable
    determination of the spectral responsivity of THz detectors. In a next step, the
    uncertainty of this technique will be further evaluated and investigations will
    be extended to other types of detectors (e.g. LiTaO<sub>3</sub> detectors and
    Golay cells).</p>"
