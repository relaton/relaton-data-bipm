abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been demonstrated that under specific conditions absorption
    bands in the spectrum of graphite high-temperature cavity radiators can be observed.
    These irregularities affect the Planckian spectra that are expected for a blackbody.
    Several investigations were made to investigate and to avoid these absorptions.
    It was shown that absorptions could be totally avoided at temperatures below 3100 K
    and, for some absorptions bands, even at higher temperatures. However, at temperatures
    above 3100 K, especially in the visible spectral range, absorption bands occur
    that unfortunately cannot be avoided. The absorptions have been identified to
    originate from molecular carbon that is increasingly subliming at the highest
    temperatures. These absorptions presently limit the use of graphite-based high-temperature
    radiators as ideal Planckian radiators.</p>"
