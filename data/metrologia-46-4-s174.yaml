abstract:
- content: "<p>In 1997, the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR)
    initiated a supplementary comparison of spectral radiance in the wavelength range
    from 220 nm to 2500 nm (CCPR-S1) using tungsten strip-filament lamps as transfer
    standards. Five national metrology institutes (NMIs) took part in the comparison:
    BNM/INM (France), NIST (USA), NRC (Canada), PTB (Germany) and VNIIOFI (Russia),
    with VNIIOFI as the pilot laboratory. Each NMI provided the transfer lamps that
    were used to transfer their measurements to the pilot laboratory. The intercomparison
    sequence began with the participant measurements, then the pilot measurements,
    followed by a second set of measurements by the participant laboratory. The measurements
    were carried out from 1998 to 2002, with the final report completed in 2008. This
    paper presents the descriptions of measurement facilities and uncertainties of
    the participants, as well as the comparison results that were analysed in accordance
    with the Guidelines for CCPR Comparisons Report Preparation, and a re-evaluation
    of the results taking into account the instability of some of the transfer lamps.
    Excluding a few wavelengths, all participants agree with each other within ±1.5%.
    The disagreement decreases to approximately ±1.0% when the anomalous data are
    excluded from the analysis.</p>"
