abstract:
- content: "<p>An automatic multi-wavelength filter radiometer (MWFR) was developed
    at the National Metrology Centre (NMC) of Singapore to realize the spectral irradiance
    scale in the wavelength range from 250 nm to 1600 nm. The UV–VIS range (250 nm
    to 900 nm) is covered by a silicon trap detector with 17 filters, while the near
    IR range (900 nm to 1600 nm) is covered by an InGaAs photodiode with 7 filters.
    A complete run of measurements at all 24 wavelength points takes only 12 min.
    The spectral irradiance scales of NMC and MIKES/TKK (Finland) in the spectral
    range from 280 nm to 900 nm were compared successfully using this instrument.
    Measurement results of three standard lamps calculated using MIKES/TKK's algorithm
    showed excellent repeatability and very good agreement with their assigned values.
    It is concluded that, compared with the conventional monochromator based spectroradiometers,
    a properly designed MWFR with sufficient spectral coverage is a good alternative
    instrument for spectral irradiance comparison owing to its faster speed and better
    short-term reproducibility.</p>"
