abstract:
- content: "<p>A new method using integrating spheres for absolute reflectance measurements
    has been developed to establish a spectral diffuse reflectance scale in the near-IR
    (NIR) region. This method is a modified version of the double-sphere method developed
    in 1966, and the modification reduces the uncertainty due to the area measurement
    of the auxiliary sphere. In this new technique, the modified double-sphere method,
    a known absolute reflectance scale in the visible region derived from another
    absolute reflectance measurement is used to extend the absolute reflectance scale
    from the visible to the NIR region without requiring a strict area measurement.
    By using this modified double-sphere method, a spectral diffuse reflectance scale
    is established from 800 nm to 1600 nm with a relative expanded uncertainty (k
    = 2) of 0.48% to 0.54% depending on the wavelength. The same principle can be
    applied to determine a spectral diffuse reflectance standard in the ultraviolet
    region as well. In this paper, an outline of the modified double-sphere method
    is described with emphasis on its theoretical and instrumental features.</p>"
