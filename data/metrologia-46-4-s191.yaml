abstract:
- content: "<p>We report theory and measurements of a simple and absolute technique
    for the determination of the total emitted spectral fluorescence yield inside
    an integrating sphere from the sphere coating under irradiation with a monochromatic
    beam. This technique measures the spectral response of a monochromatorâ€“detector
    system to the radiation exiting from an integrating sphere. The total spectral
    fluorescence yield can be calculated from the response measurement and an overall
    responsivity function that is obtained by calibrating the system with a standard
    source. This technique provides quantitative fluorescence analysis of the coating
    of an integrating sphere wall.</p>"
