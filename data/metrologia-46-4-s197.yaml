abstract:
- content: "<p>The commonly made assumption of Lambertian behaviour of fluorescence
    emission has been studied in solid amorphous material. A goniofluorometer capable
    of measurements in measurement geometries from 0 : 10 to 0 : 85 has been used
    for this purpose. The measurements indicate that the fluorescence emission from
    solid amorphous material is clearly non-Lambertian.</p>"
