abstract:
- content: "<p>A dispersion-relation-based method to determine luminous gloss and
    monochromatic-definition gloss is introduced. Through analysis of the spectral
    specular reflectance, the Sellmeier equation that determines gloss is obtained.
    The dispersion-relation-based method and the glossmeter-employed method are compared
    by determining the luminous gloss of a KRISS gloss certified reference material,
    resulting in agreement within a relative expanded uncertainty of 1.0% (k = 2).</p>"
