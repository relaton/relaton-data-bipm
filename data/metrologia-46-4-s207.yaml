abstract:
- content: "<p>The radiometric calibration spectral source (RCSS) is a very low photon
    flux radiation source based on an integrating sphere, operated under vacuum and
    cryogenic conditions, for the testing and calibration of the near infrared multiobject
    dispersive spectrograph (NIRSpec). NIRSpec itself is a part of the scientific
    instrumentation of the James Webb Space Telescope. For the traceable calibration
    of the photon flux emitted by the RCSS in the wavelength range from 0.7 µm to
    5 µm, dedicated calibration schemes were developed at PTB. To achieve this goal,
    the Spectral Radiance Comparator Facility and the Reduced Background Calibration
    Facility of the PTB have been significantly improved with respect to their detector
    instrumentation.</p>"
