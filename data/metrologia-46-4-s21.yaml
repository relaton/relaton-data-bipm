abstract:
- content: "<p>Solid-state lighting and display technology are under rapid development.
    Photometric measurement devices such as imaging systems or tristimulus sensors
    encounter complex spatial, spectral and temporal conditions. Sufficiently large
    uniform calibration sources are required to adequately match the field application
    and to facilitate acceptable calibration uncertainties. We present a relatively
    compact, large-area uniform source employing plate diffusers and a patterned mask.
    The source is easily configured with colour-selectable, temperature-stabilized
    high power LED modules. We achieve 99% spatial uniformity within a 16 cm × 16 cm
    square field with Lambertian angular characteristics.</p>"
