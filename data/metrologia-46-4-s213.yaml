abstract:
- content: "<p>The low-background infrared (LBIR) facility at the US National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been calibrating infrared test chambers
    that are used to calibrate spacebased remote sensors. These test chambers typically
    operate at temperatures of 20 K to 80 K and have collimators in them to simulate
    faint objects at great distances in a low-background environment. Since 2001 the
    LBIR facility has used a transfer radiometer, the BXR, to calibrate nine IR test
    chambers. The BXR has shown that the output of these chambers can differ from
    the modelled output by ±10%. In this paper the methodology of the BXR calibration
    activity will be described along with specific examples to highlight important
    calibration performance parameters of the BXR and of other hardware in the calibration
    chain from the primary standard.</p>"
