  content: "<p>Absolute stellar photometry is based on 1970s terrestrial measurements
    of the star Vega with instruments calibrated using the Planckian radiance from
    a Cu fixed-point blackbody. Significant advances in absolute radiometry have been
    made in the last 30 years that offer the potential to improve both terrestrial
    and space-based absolute stellar photometry. These advances include the development
    of detector-based radiometry utilizing spectrally tunable laser sources and improved
    atmospheric transmittance modelling and characterization. We describe the applications
    of these new technologies for ground-based spectral irradiance measurements of
    standard stars at wavelengths ranging from 0.35 µm to 1.7 µm.</p>"
