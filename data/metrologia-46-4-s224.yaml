abstract:
- content: "<p>An extensive database of star (and Moon) images has been collected
    by the ground-based RObotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) as part of the US Geological
    Survey program for lunar calibration. The stellar data are used to derive nightly
    atmospheric corrections for the observations from extinction measurements, and
    absolute calibration of the ROLO sensors is based on observations of Vega and
    published reference flux and spectrum data. The ROLO telescopes were designed
    for imaging the Moon at moderate resolution, thus imposing some limitations for
    the stellar photometry. Attaining accurate stellar photometry with the ROLO image
    data has required development of specialized processing techniques. A key consideration
    is consistency in discriminating the star core signal from the off-axis point
    spread function. The analysis and processing methods applied to the ROLO stellar
    image database are described.</p>"
