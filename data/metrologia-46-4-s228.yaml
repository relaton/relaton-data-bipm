abstract:
- content: "<p>This work provides a thorough insight into the performance of a new
    approach to the measurement of astronomical magnitudes. This new photometric procedure
    only considers as part of the source those pixels with a value higher than the
    sky background value within a specified confidence interval. The resultant procedure
    is robust, simple and fast, and it provides the instrumental magnitude and corresponding
    uncertainty for each celestial object within a CCD image. A numerical and observational
    comparison with the more traditional aperture photometry method is also presented.</p>"
