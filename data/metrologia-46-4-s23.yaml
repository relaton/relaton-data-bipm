abstract:
- content: "<p>From general statements made about the cooling of the CCD sensor within
    image luminance measuring devices (ILMD), one tends to conclude that cooling has
    an important effect on the luminance measurement results. However, this general
    statement is not valid. Based on a detailed model for the properties and the operation
    of ILMDs, we present results of the measurements for parameters of cooled and
    non-cooled systems. The influence of the two different parameter sets on the results
    of luminance measurements is illustrated for variations in the signal level and
    the temperature conditions. In summary, it can be said that only for very special
    applications does the cooling of the CCD have a significant influence on the measurement
    uncertainty associated with the luminance measurement results. Normally, one can
    compensate for the little drawbacks of non-cooled systems by selecting the most
    appropriate measuring algorithms.</p>"
