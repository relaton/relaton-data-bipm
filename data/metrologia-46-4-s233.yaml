abstract:
- content: "<p>Transmittance haze is increasingly important to the LCD and solar cell
    industry. Most commercial haze measurement instruments are designed according
    to the method recommended in the documentary standards like ASTM D 1003 (ASTM
    2003 Standard Test Method for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Plastics),
    JIS K 7361 (JIS 1997 Plastics—Determination of the Total Luminous Transmittance
    of Transparent Materials—Part 1: Single Beam Instrument) and ISO 14782 (ISO 1997
    Plastics—Determination of Haze of Transparent Materials). To improve the measurement
    accuracy of the current standards, a new apparatus was designed by the Center
    for Measurement Standards (Yu et al 2006 Meas. Sci. Technol. 17 N29–36). Besides
    the methods mentioned above, a double-beam method is used in the design of some
    instruments. There are discrepancies between the various methods. But no matter
    which method is used, a white standard is always needed. This paper compares the
    measurement results from different methods, presents the effect of the white standard,
    and analyses the measurement uncertainty.</p>"
