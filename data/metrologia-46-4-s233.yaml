  content: '<p>Transmittance haze is increasingly important to the LCD and solar cell
    industry. Most commercial haze measurement instruments are designed according
    to the method recommended in the documentary standards like ASTM D 1003 (ASTM
    2003 <italic>Standard Test Method for Haze and Luminous Transmittance of Transparent
    Plastics</italic>), JIS K 7361 (JIS 1997 <italic>Plastics—Determination of the
    Total Luminous Transmittance of Transparent Materials—Part 1: Single Beam Instrument</italic>)
    and ISO 14782 (ISO 1997 <italic>Plastics—Determination of Haze of Transparent
    Materials</italic>). To improve the measurement accuracy of the current standards,
    a new apparatus was designed by the Center for Measurement Standards (Yu <italic>et

    <italic>Meas. Sci. Technol.</italic> <bold>17</bold> N29–36</ext-link>). Besides
    the methods mentioned above, a double-beam method is used in the design of some
    instruments. There are discrepancies between the various methods. But no matter
    which method is used, a white standard is always needed. This paper compares the
    measurement results from different methods, presents the effect of the white standard,
    and analyses the measurement uncertainty.</p>'
