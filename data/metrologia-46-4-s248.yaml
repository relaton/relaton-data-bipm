abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurement results and applications of a recently developed device
    for the measurement of the spatial uniformity of integrating spheres are presented.
    Due to the complexity of their implementation, sphere scanners are mainly used
    by national metrology institutes to increase the accuracy of relative and absolute
    luminous flux measurements (Ohno et al 1997 J. IES 26 107–14, Ohno and Daubach
    2001 J. IES 30 105–15, Ohno 1998 Metrologia 35 473–8, Hovila et al 2004 Metrologia
    41 407–13). The major drawback of traditional scanners for integrating spheres
    is the necessity of a complex and time-consuming sphere modification, as the lamp
    holder has to be replaced by a new scanner holder with additional cables for power
    supply and for communication with the stepping motor control unit (Ohno et al
    1997 J. IES 26 107–14). Therefore, with traditional scanners the relative spatial
    sphere responsivity already changes due to the installation of a special scanner
    holder. The new scanner simply substitutes the lamp under test: it can be screwed
    into an E27 lamp socket, as it needs only two electrical contacts. Two wires are
    simultaneously used for the power supply of the stepping motor control unit, the
    scanner light source (LED) and for the signal transmission of commands and results.
    The benefits of scanner-assisted measurements are shown for spotlight lamp calibrations.</p>"
