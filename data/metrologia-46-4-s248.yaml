  content: '<p>Measurement results and applications of a recently developed device
    for the measurement of the spatial uniformity of integrating spheres are presented.
    Due to the complexity of their implementation, sphere scanners are mainly used
    by national metrology institutes to increase the accuracy of relative and absolute
    luminous flux measurements (Ohno <italic>et al</italic> 1997 <italic>J. IES</italic>
    <bold>26</bold> 107–14, Ohno and Daubach 2001 <italic>J. IES</italic> <bold>30</bold>
    105–15, Ohno <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/35/4/45">1998
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>35</bold> 473–8</ext-link>, Hovila <italic>et
    al</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/41/6/008">2004
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>41</bold> 407–13</ext-link>). The major drawback
    of traditional scanners for integrating spheres is the necessity of a complex
    and time-consuming sphere modification, as the lamp holder has to be replaced
    by a new scanner holder with additional cables for power supply and for communication
    with the stepping motor control unit (Ohno <italic>et al</italic> 1997 <italic>J.
    IES</italic> <bold>26</bold> 107–14). Therefore, with traditional scanners the
    relative spatial sphere responsivity already changes due to the installation of
    a special scanner holder. The new scanner simply substitutes the lamp under test:
    it can be screwed into an E27 lamp socket, as it needs only two electrical contacts.
    Two wires are simultaneously used for the power supply of the stepping motor control
    unit, the scanner light source (LED) and for the signal transmission of commands
    and results. The benefits of scanner-assisted measurements are shown for spotlight
    lamp calibrations.</p>'
