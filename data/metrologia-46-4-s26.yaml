abstract:
- content: "<p>We have developed Schottky barrier photodiodes of AlN, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>N,
    GaN and In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1−y</sub>N grown on n-SiC. Spectral responsivity
    measurements demonstrate that the devices fabricated have sharp cut-offs with
    a rejection ratio of over 3 decades and the cut-off wavelength can be varied by
    changing the alloy or the composition of the alloys. The internal quantum efficiency
    of an Al<sub>0.19</sub>Ga<sub>0.81</sub>N photodiode is estimated to reach 64%
    around 300 nm. It is also confirmed that the photodiodes do not notably degrade
    in responsivity to the UV radiant exposure of 5 kJ cm<sup>−2</sup> in contrast
    to Si photodiodes. Characterization on uniformity, temperature dependence and
    angular response is also conducted and gives satisfactory results for all items.
    In conclusion, the Schottky barrier photodiodes of AlN, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>N,
    GaN and In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1−y</sub>N work properly as expected and look very
    promising for precise measurements in the VUV and UV regions.</p>"
