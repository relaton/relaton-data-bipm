abstract:
- content: "<p>A radiance camera was used to investigate the radiation field emitted
    by high-temperature blackbodies and fixed-point cavities up to temperatures of
    3000 K. In a first step the applicability of the camera to measure the spectral
    radiance at such high temperatures was investigated. In a second step the radiation
    characteristics of several sources were studied using the camera system, in particular,
    large area fixed-point blackbodies of Cu, Pt–C and ZrC–C. Especially for the ZrC–C
    fixed points the radiation field at the cavity opening was found to be non-uniform.
    This observation explains systematic differences in the plateau shape of large
    aperture eutectic fixed-point cells for radiometers with different fields of view.
    Using the two-dimensional radiance distribution measured with the camera system
    the deviation of the temperatures measured with interference filter radiometers
    and radiation thermometers was studied.</p>"
