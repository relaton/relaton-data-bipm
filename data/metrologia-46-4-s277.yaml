abstract:
- content: "<p>Supercontinuum (SC) sources are novel laser-based sources that generate
    a broad, white-light continuum in single-mode photonic crystal fibres. Currently,
    up to 6 W of optical power is available, spanning the spectral range from 460 nm
    to 2400 nm. Advances in these sources promise polarized radiant flux with expanded
    spectral coverage down to 380 nm. We evaluate the use of SC sources for fundamental
    optical metrological applications.</p>"
