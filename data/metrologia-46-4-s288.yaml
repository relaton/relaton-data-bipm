  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Photon number resolving detectors based on titanium-transition edge
    sensors with high speed and high quantum efficiency have been developed for quantum
    sensors in the fields of quantum information and quantum radiometry. The two devices
    optimized at wavelengths of interest showed 81% and 64% system detection efficiencies
    at 850 nm and 1550 nm, respectively. The response speed of the device optimized
    for a high counting operation is 190 ns, which corresponds to a counting rate
    over 1 MHz.</p>"
