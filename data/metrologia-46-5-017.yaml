abstract:
- content: "<p>Critical tests of the accuracy of ab initio theoretical values of the
    helium virial coefficients have been made based on experiments with a new dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry (DCGT) setup established at PTB. As the main starting point, most
    accurate experimental results for the thermodynamic temperature and the dielectric
    polarizability of<sup>3</sup>He and<sup>4</sup>He have been deduced recently.
    This paper now concentrates on the results for the two- and three-particle interaction
    described by the second and third density virial coefficients of helium. A comparison
    between experimental DCGT results and new highly accurate theoretical ab initio
    results shows an impressive agreement. The experimental uncertainties have been
    estimated via Monte-Carlo simulations and are comparable to the uncertainty of
    the latest theory.</p>"
