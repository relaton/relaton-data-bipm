abstract:
- content: "<p>An opto-electronic device for the stabilization of laser beam intensity
    in a narrow frequency band based on a numeric corrector driving the radio-frequency
    signal of an acousto-optic modulator is applied to improve the signal-to-noise
    ratio of the detected signal in saturation spectroscopy of iodine in a cell at
    501.7 nm, both in the FM spectroscopy technique and in the transfer modulation
    technique. In the latter case, a 30 dB rejection of the amplitude noise of the
    probe beam is achieved and, when the laser frequency is locked to the saturation
    signal, the enhancement of the sensitivity of the frequency jitter detection is
    demonstrated in a frequency band extending up to 1 kHz. For the long term stabilization
    the laser is locked to a narrow line detected in a low pressure cell. A relative
    Allan deviation of about 10<sup>−13</sup> is found for 1 s integration time and
    a deviation of 10<sup>−14</sup> is reached for 500 s. Linewidths smaller than
    40 kHz (FWHM) are also demonstrated at low saturating power for hyperfine components
    of the transition R(26)62-0 at 501.7 nm.</p>"
