abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes the metrological characterization of a new large
    area piston gauge (FRS5, Furness Rosenberg Standard) installed at the vacuum metrology
    laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The operational
    procedure and the uncertainty budget for pressures between 30 Pa and 11 kPa are
    given. Comparisons between the FRS5 and a mercury manometer, a rotary piston gauge
    and a force-balanced piston gauge are described. We show that the reproducibility
    of the calibration values of capacitance diaphragm gauges is enhanced by a factor
    of 6 compared with a static expansion primary standard (SE2). Improvements of
    the SE2 performance by reducing the number of expansions and smaller uncertainties
    of expansion ratios are discussed.</p>"
