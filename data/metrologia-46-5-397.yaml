abstract:
- content: "<p>A method for evaluating the uncertainty in linking a bilateral key
    comparison to another key comparison with several participants is presented theoretically
    and demonstrated with an actual comparison. Equations are derived for the uncertainties
    of the unilateral and mutual degrees of equivalence for the linked participant
    in the bilateral comparison. It is shown that the uncertainty components related
    to uncorrelated effects in the measurements of the linking participant play a
    critical role in determining the additional uncertainties due to the linking process.
    As a practical example, the results are applied to a bilateral comparison of the
    spectral irradiance scales of MIKES (Finland) and NIMT (Thailand) in the spectral
    range from 290 nm to 900 nm.</p>"
