  content: "<p>The Monte Carlo method is recommended to propagate distributions through
    the equation of the measurand in the <italic>first supplement to the GUM</italic>.
    The result of this method is an approximation of the probability density function
    (PDF) representing the output quantity of the measurement. This approximation
    can be used to calculate all necessary statistical parameters such as the expectation
    value or the standard uncertainty of the measurand. For computational reasons,
    it is advisable to use a block-by-block evaluation, the Monte Carlo block design,
    when implementing this method. The statistical parameters of the measurand are
    then calculated using the statistical parameters of equal sized blocks. This paper
    demonstrates that this procedure delivers reasonable estimators for the true statistical
    parameters of the PDF representing the measurand.</p>"
