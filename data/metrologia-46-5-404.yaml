abstract:
- content: "<p>The Monte Carlo method is recommended to propagate distributions through
    the equation of the measurand in the first supplement to the GUM. The result of
    this method is an approximation of the probability density function (PDF) representing
    the output quantity of the measurement. This approximation can be used to calculate
    all necessary statistical parameters such as the expectation value or the standard
    uncertainty of the measurand. For computational reasons, it is advisable to use
    a block-by-block evaluation, the Monte Carlo block design, when implementing this
    method. The statistical parameters of the measurand are then calculated using
    the statistical parameters of equal sized blocks. This paper demonstrates that
    this procedure delivers reasonable estimators for the true statistical parameters
    of the PDF representing the measurand.</p>"
