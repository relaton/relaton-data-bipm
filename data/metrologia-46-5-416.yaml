abstract:
- content: "<p>For the new definition of the SI unit of mass based on a fundamental
    constant, a redetermination of Avogadro's constant is the goal of an international
    collaboration of numerous national laboratories and universities. Since a relative
    uncertainty of about 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> is aimed at, the macroscopic density,
    the isotopic composition and the volume of the unit cell of a silicon single crystal
    have to be measured with high precision. One step to improve the precision was
    the production of a silicon crystal of highly enriched<sup>28</sup>Si. This paper
    addresses the effect of thermal expansion of that material in order to account
    for a possible discrepancy between the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)
    of natural silicon and that of<sup>28</sup>Si. The results of two independent
    CTE measuring methods are presented and compared in this paper.</p>"
