abstract:
- content: "<p>The half-life of<sup>233</sup>U was determined by a specific activity
    method, in the frame of an international collaboration project of four metrology
    institutes. A purified, highly enriched<sup>233</sup>U solution was prepared with
    certified concentration of uranium isotopes. The isotopic composition of the uranium
    material was determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The ingrowth
    of daughter nuclides was calculated and confirmed by α-particle and γ-ray spectrometry
    measurements. Quantitative sources were prepared from aliquots of the<sup>233</sup>U
    solution and their disintegration rate was determined by means of α-particle counting
    at a defined small solid angle, liquid-scintillation counting and 4π counting
    in a pressurized proportional counter and in a CsI(Tl) sandwich spectrometer.
    A half-life value of 1.5867 (14) × 10<sup>5</sup> a was obtained, in which the
    relative standard uncertainty amounts to 0.09%. The result is lower than the currently
    recommended value of 1.592 (2) × 10<sup>5</sup> a and a new best estimate of T<sub>1/2</sub>(<sup>233</sup>U)
    = 1.5903 (13) × 10<sup>5</sup> a was calculated from a partially weighted mean
    of a set of published data.</p>"
