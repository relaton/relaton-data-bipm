  content: "<p>The half-life of <sup>233</sup>U was determined by a specific activity
    method, in the frame of an international collaboration project of four metrology
    institutes. A purified, highly enriched <sup>233</sup>U solution was prepared
    with certified concentration of uranium isotopes. The isotopic composition of
    the uranium material was determined by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. The
    ingrowth of daughter nuclides was calculated and confirmed by α-particle and γ-ray
    spectrometry measurements. Quantitative sources were prepared from aliquots of
    the <sup>233</sup>U solution and their disintegration rate was determined by means
    of α-particle counting at a defined small solid angle, liquid-scintillation counting
    and 4π counting in a pressurized proportional counter and in a CsI(Tl) sandwich
    spectrometer. A half-life value of 1.5867 (14) × 10<sup>5</sup> a was obtained,
    in which the relative standard uncertainty amounts to 0.09%. The result is lower
    than the currently recommended value of 1.592 (2) × 10<sup>5</sup> a and a new
    best estimate of <italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub>(<sup>233</sup>U) = 1.5903 (13)
    × 10<sup>5</sup> a was calculated from a partially weighted mean of a set of published
    data.</p>"
