  content: "<p>We present an investigation of iodine cell purity and influence of
    contaminations upon frequency shifts of iodine-stabilized frequency-doubled Nd : YAG
    lasers. The study combines measurements of laser-induced fluorescence and evaluation
    through the Stern–Volmer formula, with direct measurement of frequency shifts
    referenced by means of an optical comb to a radiofrequency clock etalon. These
    indirect and direct approaches are compared and provide feedback on the cell manufacturing
    procedure. Significant improvement of the apparatus for the measurement of induced
    fluorescence is reported, leading to better repeatability of the results. The
    ultimate precision that can be achieved in measurements of the absolute frequency
    of a stabilized laser is discussed in terms of the cell quality.</p>"
