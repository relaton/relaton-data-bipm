abstract:
- content: "<p>The trend towards an International System of Units (SI) based on fundamental
    constants has been confirmed and recent actions could result in the redefinition
    of the four units still necessary to cover all the quantities of interest for
    physics and chemistry. In this paper some issues whose solution is becoming critical
    with the approach of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) of
    2011 are discussed. The traditional kinds of definition and the new proposals
    are considered on the basis of their mathematical expressions and the advantageous
    features of the most advanced proposal are pointed out. The problem of choosing
    the set of fundamental constants to be adopted as reference quantities for the
    SI units is addressed and a general rule for verifying that the set is sufficient
    and non-redundant is pointed out in the form of a linear system giving also expressions
    of all the units as functions of the reference constants. A partial application
    to the most important units and different sets of constants offers some comparative
    criteria and shows the advantages of a set including both h and m<sub>e</sub>.
    A general condition to be fulfilled by an experiment in order to realize an SI
    unit is given and a procedure suitable to optimize the availability of the best
    relization on a global basis is outlined. Finally, the dissemination process is
    analysed to show that the implied comparisons of standards at any level are not
    affected by the realization uncertainty, so that the process can be continued
    with the same standards, independently of any change in the basic reference quantities
    of the unit system.</p>"
