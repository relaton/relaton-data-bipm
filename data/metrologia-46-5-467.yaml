  content: "<p>A watt balance relates mechanical power to electrical power by comparing
    the gravitational force on a mass with the electromagnetic force on a current-carrying
    coil in a magnetic field. It is one of the favoured approaches to replacing the
    present artefact kilogram as it will allow the kilogram to be redefined in terms
    of the Planck constant. In this paper, we propose an oscillatory approach to the
    dynamic or moving mode of a watt balance experiment as an alternative to the traditional
    constant velocity approach. Features of an oscillatory dynamic mode include frequency
    selection and Fourier analysis to reduce noise due to vibration, the option of
    larger coil velocities (above 2 mm s<sup>−1</sup>) and smaller coil movement amplitudes
    (of order ±1 mm) than the constant velocity approach, and direct measurement at
    the weighing position of the factor γ relating coil current to the gravitational
    force on the mass. An oscillatory dynamic mode can be used with some of the existing
    watt balance experiments with the potential to measure γ faster and more precisely
    than the constant velocity approach.</p>"
