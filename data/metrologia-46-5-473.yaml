abstract:
- content: "<p>A Pd–C eutectic fixed point cell (1492 °C) was constructed to investigate
    its utility for thermocouple calibration. The primary aim of the study was to
    evaluate the long-term stability, immersion characteristics (influence of heat
    conduction along the thermocouple stem) and robustness of a Pd–C fixed point using
    a Pt/Pd thermocouple, especially constructed for this purpose. The performance
    of both devices at this relatively high temperature could therefore be tested.
    The melting and freezing plateaux at the Pd–C eutectic point were measured using
    the Pt/Pd thermocouple. The total exposure to the Pd–C melting temperature was
    about 850 h for the fixed point cell and 550 h for the thermocouple. The standard
    deviations of the melting and freezing points were 1.03 µV (0.041 °C) and 0.77 µV
    (0.031 °C) respectively. The emfs of the thermocouple at the melting point were
    observed to drift by about 0.1 °C. The immersion measurements show that for the
    current cell design, the measuring junction should be at most 30 mm from the bottom
    of the thermowell to be properly immersed. The long-term performance and robustness
    of the fixed point indicate a promising future for its use as a fixed point for
    calibration of noble metal thermocouples.</p>"
