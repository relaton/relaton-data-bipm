abstract:
- content: "<p>Various techniques are used to measure the mean particle size (PS)
    and the particle size distribution (PSD) and relevant uncertainties of the measured
    mean PS and PSD can be obtained by using statistical treatments. Among those techniques,
    microscopic analysis methods provide the possibility to observe individual particles,
    allowing detailed information about the PS. However, there is no existing method
    to estimate the uncertainty of the PSD from a finite number of data obtained by
    microscopic measurement. We found that it is possible to adopt the method of deducing
    the standard deviation of the sample standard deviation to estimate the PSD uncertainty
    from the result of a microscopic analysis when the sample data follow a normal
    or log-normal distribution. The recommended minimum number of data for the application
    of developed statistical methods was deduced by simulation with population data
    sets of pseudorandom numbers. It was found that the PS of gold nanoparticles (NPs)
    synthesized by the conventional reduction method in aqueous solution followed
    a log-normal distribution, indicating that this method is applicable to estimate
    the PSD uncertainty of synthetic Au NPs from the measured PS data obtained by
    microscopic methods.</p>"
