    <p>A set-up for the calibration of a heterodyne laser-vibrometer is described. By a distinctive optical set-up it is possible to use the laser of the device under test as the single source for the calibration device. In this way many difficulties of the optical adjustment usually encountered in set-ups for laser-vibrometer calibration are avoided and exceptionally low measurement uncertainties are achieved.</p>
    <p>This article describes the set-up for the case of a commercially available device which is additionally modified to provide the means for primary traceability. The measurement results are discussed for the analogue output usually used in industrial applications as well as for the output of the photodetector signal, which is used if the device is part of a primary calibration system. Special attention is given to the provisions necessary to achieve low measurement uncertainties.</p>
