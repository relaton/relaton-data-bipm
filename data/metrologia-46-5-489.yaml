abstract:
- content: "<p>A set-up for the calibration of a heterodyne laser-vibrometer is described.
    By a distinctive optical set-up it is possible to use the laser of the device
    under test as the single source for the calibration device. In this way many difficulties
    of the optical adjustment usually encountered in set-ups for laser-vibrometer
    calibration are avoided and exceptionally low measurement uncertainties are achieved.</p><p>This
    article describes the set-up for the case of a commercially available device which
    is additionally modified to provide the means for primary traceability. The measurement
    results are discussed for the analogue output usually used in industrial applications
    as well as for the output of the photodetector signal, which is used if the device
    is part of a primary calibration system. Special attention is given to the provisions
    necessary to achieve low measurement uncertainties.</p>"
