abstract:
- content: "<p>Surface tension effects in capillary viscometry play an important role
    in the accuracy of the measurements of kinematic viscosity. An experimental evaluation
    of these effects has been carried out using capillary viscometers having the same
    shape and size of the upper and lower bulbs, the same timing bulb, the same capillary
    radius, but different capillary lengths. The measurement method applied for evaluating
    the correction factor and its associated uncertainty is described. As an example,
    results of the kinematic viscosity of the liquid n-nonane, obtained with two Ubbelohde
    viscometers, which have been calibrated with bi-distilled water, are presented.</p>"
