abstract:
- content: "<p>National measurement institutes (NMIs) participate in international
    key comparisons organized by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM),
    the Regional Metrology Organizations (RMOs) or the Consultative Committees of
    the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) in order to provide evidence
    of equivalent reference standards and measurement capabilities. The US National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Measurement Institute
    of Australia (NMIA) have recently examined power loading and several other influences
    on the value of precision transportable 1 Ω resistors that can increase the uncertainty
    of key comparisons. We have studied the effects of temperature, barometric pressure,
    humidity, power loading and heat dissipation in oil on transportable wire-wound
    1 Ω resistance standards that are based on different alloys and construction principles.
    This work focuses on standards manufactured from 1970 through 2000 by the NMIA
    made of Evanohm alloy and on Thomas-type resistors designed in the 1930s and made
    of Manganin alloy. We show that the relative standard uncertainty related to transport
    can be less than 0.01 μΩ Ω<sup>−1</sup> when using certain resistors of these
    two types that are characterized and selected for stability. We describe the characterization
    process, and relate the environmental influences to the physical design, as well
    as to the mechanical properties and condition of the standards.</p>"
