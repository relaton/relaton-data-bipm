abstract:
- content: "<p>The variance of temperature measurements made with the NIST Johnson
    noise thermometer has been reduced by the use of improved cross-correlation electronics
    and a unique method for measuring and reducing non-linearities. The spectral response
    of the voltage noise and the reproducibility of the measured temperature were
    improved by the use of a lower-noise preamplifier with better common-mode rejection
    and by removal of a systematic aliasing error through additional filtering. Even
    with these improvements, however, measurements with precision multi-tone comb
    and two-tone waveforms, which were synthesized with the quantum voltage noise
    source, showed that distortion generated by non-linearities in the electronics
    still limited the measurement standard deviation to (3–5) µK/K greater than that
    expected for uncorrelated white noise. The new electronics and the measurement
    techniques used to characterize the non-linearities are described. Synthesized
    waveforms that have higher tone density are shown to reduce the distortion generated
    by the remaining non-linearities so that the variance of the measurement is no
    longer limited and continues to decrease with measurement time as expected.</p>"
