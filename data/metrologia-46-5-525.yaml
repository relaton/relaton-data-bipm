  content: "<p>Critical tests of the accuracy of <italic>ab initio</italic> theoretical
    values of the helium virial coefficients have been made based on experiments with
    a new dielectric-constant gas thermometry (DCGT) setup established at PTB. As
    the main starting point, most accurate experimental results for the thermodynamic
    temperature and the dielectric polarizability of <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He
    have been deduced recently. This paper now concentrates on the results for the
    two- and three-particle interaction described by the second and third density
    virial coefficients of helium. A comparison between experimental DCGT results
    and new highly accurate theoretical <italic>ab initio</italic> results shows an
    impressive agreement. The experimental uncertainties have been estimated via Monte-Carlo
    simulations and are comparable to the uncertainty of the latest theory.</p>"
