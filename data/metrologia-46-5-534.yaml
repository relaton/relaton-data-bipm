  content: "<p>In this paper it is shown that the size-of-source effect (SSE) of a
    radiation thermometer measured for a range of source diameters <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>,
    can be fitted by means of empirical analytical approximations <italic>F</italic>(<italic>D</italic>),
    selected on the basis of quite general arguments. This is necessary to analytically
    process SSE data and to rigorously quantify the uncertainties associated with
    the correction for the SSE. To test the proposed fitting scheme 35 size-of-source
    curves, measured by five institutes for different radiation thermometers, have
    been analysed. In a companion paper the uncertainty in the correction for the
    SSE will be elaborated in detail for two examples.</p>"
