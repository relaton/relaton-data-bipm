abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper it is shown that the size-of-source effect (SSE) of a
    radiation thermometer measured for a range of source diameters D<sub>i</sub>,
    can be fitted by means of empirical analytical approximations F(D), selected on
    the basis of quite general arguments. This is necessary to analytically process
    SSE data and to rigorously quantify the uncertainties associated with the correction
    for the SSE. To test the proposed fitting scheme 35 size-of-source curves, measured
    by five institutes for different radiation thermometers, have been analysed. In
    a companion paper the uncertainty in the correction for the SSE will be elaborated
    in detail for two examples.</p>"
