  content: "<p>In the first part of this paper a procedure is described for calculating
    the standard uncertainty <italic>u</italic>[<italic>F</italic>(<italic>D</italic>)]
    in the approximation <italic>F</italic>(<italic>D</italic>) to the size-of-source
    effect σ(<italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>), measured for a range
    of source diameters <italic>D</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, for two examples
    out of a total of 35 considered in an accompanying paper. The overall uncertainty
    includes the uncertainty <italic>s</italic><sub>fit</sub> of the approximation
    <italic>F</italic>(<italic>D</italic>) to the experimental data and other components
    such as the repeatability of the measurements, the effect of interreflections
    and the in-focus/out-of-focus shift. In the main part of the paper this procedure
    is tailored to the calculation of the uncertainty <italic>u</italic><sub>SSE</sub>[<italic>S</italic>(<italic>D</italic><sub>ref</sub>)]/<italic>S</italic>(<italic>D</italic><sub>ref</sub>)
    in the correction for the size-of-source effect as a function of the reference
    diameter <italic>D</italic><sub>ref</sub>, a relationship characteristic for a
    given thermometer–source combination. The source considered here is a eutectic
    fixed-point radiator, Re–C, radiating at the eutectic temperature of 2747 K. The
    correction is carried out by transformation of the directly obtained results,
    in terms of the signals <italic>S</italic> measured under the local prevailing
    measurement conditions, to univocal results associated with a specified reference
    condition. The utility of the formalism is demonstrated by some practical applications
    given in an appendix to the paper.</p>"
