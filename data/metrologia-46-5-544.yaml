abstract:
- content: "<p>In the first part of this paper a procedure is described for calculating
    the standard uncertainty u[F(D)] in the approximation F(D) to the size-of-source
    effect σ(D<sub>i</sub>), measured for a range of source diameters D<sub>i</sub>,
    for two examples out of a total of 35 considered in an accompanying paper. The
    overall uncertainty includes the uncertainty s<sub>fit</sub> of the approximation
    F(D) to the experimental data and other components such as the repeatability of
    the measurements, the effect of interreflections and the in-focus/out-of-focus
    shift. In the main part of the paper this procedure is tailored to the calculation
    of the uncertainty u<sub>SSE</sub>[S(D<sub>ref</sub>)]/S(D<sub>ref</sub>) in the
    correction for the size-of-source effect as a function of the reference diameter
    D<sub>ref</sub>, a relationship characteristic for a given thermometer–source
    combination. The source considered here is a eutectic fixed-point radiator, Re–C,
    radiating at the eutectic temperature of 2747 K. The correction is carried out
    by transformation of the directly obtained results, in terms of the signals S
    measured under the local prevailing measurement conditions, to univocal results
    associated with a specified reference condition. The utility of the formalism
    is demonstrated by some practical applications given in an appendix to the paper.</p>"
