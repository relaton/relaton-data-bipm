abstract:
- content: "<p>The dependence of the eigenvalues of the TM1n and TE1n electromagnetic
    triplet modes on the shape of a triaxial ellipsoid cavity resonator is investigated.
    For an ellipsoid with semi-axes proportional to 1: (1 + ϵ<sub>1</sub>): (1 + ϵ<sub>2</sub>)
    the fractional perturbations of the triplet components are found to second order
    in ϵ<sub>1</sub> and ϵ<sub>2</sub>. The formulae are derived from the results
    of Kokkorakis and Roumeliotis (1997 J. Electromagn. Waves Appl. 11 279–92) for
    prolate and oblate spheroids. Finite-element calculations were carried out to
    confirm the accuracy of the formulae and to determine the next correction terms.</p>"
