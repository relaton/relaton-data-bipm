abstract:
- content: "<p>Test leaks with a gas flow to atmospheric pressure are often called
    sniffer test leaks. They are used to calibrate leak detectors for sniffing applications.
    Sniffer test leaks need calibration against a standard. A primary standard for
    the calibration of sniffer test leaks with relatively low measurement uncertainties
    is described. It is assured that the measurement result is traceable to the relevant
    SI units and that there is a well-known and complete measurement uncertainty budget.
    The measurement range of the system is from 4 × 10<sup>−11</sup> mol s<sup>−1</sup>
    (corresponding to 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa l s<sup>−1</sup> at 23 °C) to 4 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mol s<sup>−1</sup>
    (10<sup>−2</sup> Pa l s<sup>−1</sup> at 23 °C), which is the most often needed
    range in industry of around 1 g loss per year of the cooling agent R134a. The
    temperature where the calibration can be carried out may vary from 18 °C to 30 °C.
    The flow rate of any test gas not condensing in this temperature range can be
    measured.</p>"
