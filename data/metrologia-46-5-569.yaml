  content: "<p>We show how to solve two problems of optimal linear estimation from
    a set of noisy measurements of clock phase. The phase is modelled as a process
    with stationary <italic>d</italic>th increments, e.g. a sum of processes with
    power-law spectra. The additive measurement noise can be any mean-zero process
    with a known autocovariance function. The estimation targets are the phase at
    a given time and the coefficient of the overall trend, e.g. the frequency drift.
    A feasibility condition called ‘invariance’ is imposed according to the target
    and the degree of non-stationarity of the phase model. The solution of a set of
    linear equations gives the regression coefficients and the mean squared error
    of the best linear invariant estimate. Proofs of these results are available from
    the online version of this journal.</p>"
