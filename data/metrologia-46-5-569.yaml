abstract:
- content: "<p>We show how to solve two problems of optimal linear estimation from
    a set of noisy measurements of clock phase. The phase is modelled as a process
    with stationary dth increments, e.g. a sum of processes with power-law spectra.
    The additive measurement noise can be any mean-zero process with a known autocovariance
    function. The estimation targets are the phase at a given time and the coefficient
    of the overall trend, e.g. the frequency drift. A feasibility condition called
    ‘invariance’ is imposed according to the target and the degree of non-stationarity
    of the phase model. The solution of a set of linear equations gives the regression
    coefficients and the mean squared error of the best linear invariant estimate.
    Proofs of these results are available from the online version of this journal.</p>"
