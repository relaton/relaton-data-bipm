  content: "<p>Recent developments have cast doubt on the value for the electron stopping
    power for graphite used in dosimetry. Information has come from a number of areas:
    a new measurement of the mean excitation energy, <italic>I</italic>, for graphite;
    experiments indicating that the crystallite density for graphite, rather than
    its bulk density, should be used to evaluate the stopping power; experiments in
    medium-energy x-rays comparing free-air and cavity ionization chambers and Monte
    Carlo calculations of the behaviour of graphite-walled cavity chambers in <sup>60</sup>Co
    gamma-rays and medium-energy x-rays. The stopping powers for graphite currently
    recommended were evaluated using an <italic>I</italic>-value of 78 eV. The use
    of the more recent value <italic>I</italic> = 86.9 eV reduces the graphite stopping
    power for <sup>60</sup>Co by around 1.5%, which in a simple analysis increases
    the <italic>W</italic>-value for air by a similar amount. However, such an increase
    is in conflict with the evidence that the <italic>W</italic>-value is close to
    the value 33.97 eV currently recommended. This paper presents the various components
    and constraints, analyses the uncertainties and shows that the use of a graphite
    <italic>I</italic>-value of 82.5 eV, a <italic>W</italic>-value of 33.97 eV and
    the crystallite density of graphite reasonably explain the experimental observations.
    The standard uncertainty of this <italic>I</italic>-value determination is 1.5 eV.</p>"
