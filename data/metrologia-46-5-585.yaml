abstract:
- content: "<p>Recent developments have cast doubt on the value for the electron stopping
    power for graphite used in dosimetry. Information has come from a number of areas:
    a new measurement of the mean excitation energy, I, for graphite; experiments
    indicating that the crystallite density for graphite, rather than its bulk density,
    should be used to evaluate the stopping power; experiments in medium-energy x-rays
    comparing free-air and cavity ionization chambers and Monte Carlo calculations
    of the behaviour of graphite-walled cavity chambers in<sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays
    and medium-energy x-rays. The stopping powers for graphite currently recommended
    were evaluated using an I-value of 78 eV. The use of the more recent value I =
    86.9 eV reduces the graphite stopping power for<sup>60</sup>Co by around 1.5%,
    which in a simple analysis increases the W-value for air by a similar amount.
    However, such an increase is in conflict with the evidence that the W-value is
    close to the value 33.97 eV currently recommended. This paper presents the various
    components and constraints, analyses the uncertainties and shows that the use
    of a graphite I-value of 82.5 eV, a W-value of 33.97 eV and the crystallite density
    of graphite reasonably explain the experimental observations. The standard uncertainty
    of this I-value determination is 1.5 eV.</p>"
