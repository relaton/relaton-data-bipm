abstract:
- content: "<p>Two methods for comparing the pressures of different media generated
    by gas and hydraulic pressure balances are examined in order to improve the consistency
    between gas and hydraulic pressure standards. One method uses a gas–liquid separator
    and the other uses a liquid-lubricated pressure balance. The pressure range examined
    is 0.5 MPa to 7 MPa. For both methods, a precise pressure transducer is used as
    a comparator to determine the equilibrium state between the two pressure balances.
    In this paper, the measurement results and the uncertainties obtained for the
    respective methods are presented. It is shown that the results obtained by using
    both methods agree within the combined standard uncertainty over the entire pressure
    range. Thus, both methods examined in this study are found to be useful for comparing
    gas and hydraulic pressure balances accurately.</p>"
