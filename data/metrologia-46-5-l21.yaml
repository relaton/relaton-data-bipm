- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>A re-evaluation of the BIPM standards for air kerma in low- and medium-energy
    x-rays has been made. The changes to the air-kerma rate determination arise from
    three sources: (i) the results of Monte Carlo calculations of diaphragm correction
    factors for the standards, (ii) a measurement of the effect of scatter from the
    diaphragm support and (iii) a re-evaluation of the electron-loss corrections for
    the medium-energy standard. Scatter from the diaphragm support explains a long-standing
    trend observed in the results of international comparisons for medium-energy x-rays.
    The new standards were implemented on 1 September 2009.</p>"
