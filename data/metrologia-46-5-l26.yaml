  content: "<p>From 1 May 2009 the United Kingdom National Physical Laboratory (NPL)
    has changed its air kerma standards for Cs-137 and Co-60 γ-rays. Adoption of the
    new correction factors results in an increase in the NPL air kerma standard by
    ∼1% for both Cs-137 and Co-60 γ-rays. All NPL secondary standard calibrations
    issued after 1 May 2009 contain the revised correction factor.</p>"
