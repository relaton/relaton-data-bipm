abstract:
- content: "<p>In view of the progress achieved in the field of the alternating current
    (ac) quantum Hall effect (QHE), the Working Group of the Comité Consultatif d'Électricité
    et Magnétisme (CCEM) on the ac QHE asked the authors of this article to write
    a compendium which integrates their experiences with ac measurements of the quantum
    Hall resistance. In addition to the important early work performed at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures and the National Physical Laboratory, UK, further
    experience has been gained during a collaboration of the authors' institutes NRC,
    METAS and PTB, and excellent agreement between the results of different national
    metrology institutes has been achieved. This compendium summarizes the present
    state of the authors' knowledge and reviews the experiences, tests and precautions
    that the authors have employed to achieve accurate measurements of the ac QHE.
    This work shows how the ac QHE can be reliably used as a quantum standard of ac
    resistance having a relative uncertainty of a few parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.</p>"
