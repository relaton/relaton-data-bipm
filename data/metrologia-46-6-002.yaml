abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been argued that the probability associated with a coverage
    interval calculated following the procedure proposed in Supplement 1 to the GUM
    should be about equal to the proportion of independent intervals reckoned over
    time that contain the measurand (Willink  2006  Metrologia   43  L39–42, Hall
    \ 2008  Metrologia   45  L5–8, Possolo  et al   2009  Metrologia   46  L1–7 ).
    The opposite point of view maintains that a coverage probability can only be interpreted
    as the degree of belief in the quoted interval containing the unknown value of
    the measurand (Lira  2008  Metrologia   45  L21–3 ). In this paper, two simple
    examples are presented to reinforce the latter interpretation.</p>"
