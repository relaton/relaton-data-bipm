  content: "<p>This paper addresses the international humidity community's need for
    standardization of methods for propagation of uncertainty associated with humidity
    generators and for handling uncertainty associated with the reference water vapour-pressure
    and enhancement-factor equations. The paper outlines uncertainty calculations
    for the mixing ratio, dew-point temperature and relative humidity output from
    humidity generators, and in particular considers controlling equations for a theoretical
    hybrid humidity generator combining single-pressure (1-P), two-pressure (2-P)
    and two-flow (2-F) principles. Also considered is the case where the humidity
    generator is used as a stable source with traceability derived from a reference
    hygrometer, i.e. a dew-point meter, a relative humidity meter or a wet-bulb psychrometer.
    Most humidity generators in use at national metrology institutes can be considered
    to be special cases of those considered here and sensitivity coefficients for
    particular types may be extracted. The ability to account for correlations between
    input variables and between different instances of the evaluation of the reference
    equations is discussed. The uncertainty calculation examples presented here are
    representative of most humidity calculations.</p>"
