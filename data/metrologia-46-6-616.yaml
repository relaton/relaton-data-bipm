  content: <p>It has been argued that the probability associated with a coverage interval
    calculated following the procedure proposed in Supplement 1 to the GUM should
    be about equal to the proportion of independent intervals reckoned over time that
    contain the measurand (Willink <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/43/6/N02">2006

    of view maintains that a coverage probability can only be interpreted as the degree
    of belief in the quoted interval containing the unknown value of the measurand

    two simple examples are presented to reinforce the latter interpretation.</p>
