abstract:
- content: "<p>Since the quantum Hall resistance (QHR) measured with alternating current
    (ac) has reached the state of an excellent quantum standard of impedance, we have
    realized a quadrature bridge with two ac QHRs to accurately calibrate capacitance
    standards in terms of the SI value of the von-Klitzing constant, without the need
    for any calculable artefact. The advantages of the realized measuring chain, experimental
    tests of the coaxial ac bridges involved and the achieved relative uncertainty
    of 6 × 10<sup>−9</sup> (k = 1) are discussed.</p>"
