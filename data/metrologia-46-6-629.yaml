abstract:
- content: "<p>Caesium-fountain frequency standards realize the second in the International
    System of Units with a relative uncertainty approaching 10<sup>−16</sup>. Among
    the main contributions to the accuracy budget, cold collisions play an important
    role because of the atomic density shift of the reference atomic transition. This
    paper describes an application of the Bayesian analysis of the clock frequency
    to estimate the density shift and describes how the Bayes theorem allows the a
    priori knowledge of the sign of the collisional coefficient to be rigorously embedded
    into the analysis. As an application, data from the INRIM caesium fountain are
    used and the Bayesian and orthodox analyses are compared. The Bayes theorem allows
    the orthodox uncertainty to be reduced by 28% and demonstrates that it is an important
    tool in primary frequency metrology.</p>"
