abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The paper presents modifications of the sine-approximation method (SAM)
    specified in ISO 16063-11:1998, focusing on two of the various well-established
    versions: (i) SAM version using heterodyne quadrature signals (HQS) and (ii) SAM
    version using time interval analysis (TIA), and their implementation in the national
    medium-frequency vibration standard of NIM, China. For the HQS version, modified
    techniques and procedures have been introduced applicable to suppress disturbing
    effects from frequency instability of the carrier signal and from displacement
    drift. For the TIA version, a new algorithm has been developed for which the frequency
    demodulation is based on the estimation of time intervals between neighbouring
    peaks and valleys of the laser Doppler interferometer instead of successive positive
    or negative zero crossings. A spline approximation has been implemented allowing
    relatively slow sampling rates (e.g. 5 MS s<sup>−1</sup>) to be applied. The low
    requirements on hardware techniques allow primary vibration calibrations with
    high accuracy to be performed efficiently and cost effectively. Some results of
    investigations of the modified versions of SAM are demonstrated. The results achieved
    by these modified SAM versions are compared with each other and with PTB results
    measured within the complementary key comparison CCAUV.V-K1.1 piloted by PTB from
    2006 to 2007.</p>"
