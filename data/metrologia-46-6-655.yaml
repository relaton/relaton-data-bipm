abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, the aspects of gas-operated pressure balances that affect
    their performance are discussed. These aspects include both the features that
    make gas-operated pressure balances suitable for use as pressure standards and
    the factors that must be managed to achieve good performance. As key features,
    gas-operated pressure balances are pressure generators, have excellent relative
    short-term stability (∼5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) and long-term stability (∼1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>),
    and can be used as primary standards. Factors to manage include harmonic oscillation
    of the piston in the cylinder, pressure balance temperature and operating height,
    and geometric imperfections. Three applications are used to illustrate the performance
    aspects of gas-operated pressure balances: a primary standard, a standard for
    differential pressure from &lt;1 Pa to &gt;1000 Pa and a standard for absolute
    pressure from &lt;10 Pa to 10 kPa.</p>"
