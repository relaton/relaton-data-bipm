abstract:
- content: "<p>When identical readings are independently obtained under low instrument
    resolution d, so that a reading x implies an actual value between x − (d/2) and
    x + (d/2), the method of fiducial inference yields the result that the commonly
    assumed standard uncertainty \n applies only to the case where the input standard
    deviation is known to be very low, ≈ 0.03d or less. The standard uncertainty \n
    is the standard deviation of a rectangular distribution whose base is of length
    d. If there is little knowledge of the input standard deviation, the standard
    uncertainty is closer to. The standard uncertainty \n is the standard deviation
    of a symmetrical (isosceles) triangular distribution whose base is of length d.
    This latter standard uncertainty increases above \n as the number of identical
    independent readings decreases.</p>"
