  content: "<p>Considerations have been made to derive a correction for the diameter
    measurements of a sphere by means of a special sphere interferometer. This correction
    is caused by the finite diameter of the light source acting as the entrance ‘pinhole’
    aperture in the light collimating system. The finite diameter has the effect that
    the wave which is incident on the sphere is a superposition of spherical waves
    which are slightly inclined with respect to each other. The resulting correction
    is essential for high accuracy dimensional measurements of silicon spheres to
    determine the Avogadro constant—a new determination of which is a contribution
    to a new definition of the kilogram.</p>"
