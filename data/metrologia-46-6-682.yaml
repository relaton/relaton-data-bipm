abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Harmonized sample pre-treatment is an essential first step in ensuring
    quality of measurements as regards repeatability, interlaboratory reproducibility
    and commutability. The development of standard preparation methods for single-wall
    carbon nanotube (SWCNT) samples is therefore essential to progress in their investigation
    and eventual commercialization. Here, descriptions of sample preparation and pre-treatment
    for the physicochemical characterization of SWCNTs are provided. Analytical methods
    of these protocols include scanning electron microscopy (dry, wet), transmission
    electron microscopy (dry, wet), atomic force microscopy, inductively coupled plasma
    mass spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, Raman spectroscopy (dry, wet),
    UV–Vis–NIR absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, manometric isothermal
    gas adsorption and thermogravimetric analysis. Although sample preparation refers
    to these specific methods, application to other methods for measurement and characterization
    of SWCNTs can be envisioned.</p>"
