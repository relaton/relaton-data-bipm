  content: "<p>This paper presents a prototype real-time clock ensemble system that
    utilizes a Kalman filter-based ensemble algorithm to combine remote clocks linked
    via a real-time GPS carrier-phase time transfer network. The calculated ensemble
    clock is realized by the use of an optimal control technique, where emphasis is
    placed on seeking a balance between the short-term stability of a hydrogen maser
    clock and the long-term stability of the ensemble clock. The performance of the
    system is investigated by conducting a five-month long ensemble experiment based
    on local realizations of UTC from four timing laboratories, and the frequency
    stability of the real-time ensemble time scale as well as its realizations are
    assessed with reference to UTC.</p>"
