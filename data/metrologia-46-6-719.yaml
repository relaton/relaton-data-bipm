    <p>In table 2 of this paper, the values of the normal effective emissivity are presented, instead of values of the hemispherical effective emissivity for an isothermal cavity with β = 30°. Here, we present the corrected portion of table 2.  Also, in figure 5 (right-side plot) and figure 6 (left column, second row), instead of a cavity with β = 58°, the plots for a cavity with slightly different geometric parameters are shown. We show here the corrected map of reflections and a three-dimensional plot of the distribution of the local normal effective emissivity.</p>
    <p>The corrected portions of table 2, figure 5 and figure 6 are given in the pdf file.</p>
