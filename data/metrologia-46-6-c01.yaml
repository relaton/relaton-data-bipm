abstract:
- content: "<p>In table 2 of this paper, the values of the normal effective emissivity
    are presented, instead of values of the hemispherical effective emissivity for
    an isothermal cavity with β = 30°. Here, we present the corrected portion of table
    2.  Also, in figure 5 (right-side plot) and figure 6 (left column, second row),
    instead of a cavity with β = 58°, the plots for a cavity with slightly different
    geometric parameters are shown. We show here the corrected map of reflections
    and a three-dimensional plot of the distribution of the local normal effective
    emissivity.</p><p>The corrected portions of table 2, figure 5 and figure 6 are
    given in the pdf file.</p>"
