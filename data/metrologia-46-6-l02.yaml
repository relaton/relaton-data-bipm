abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO TS21748:2003 statement that the laboratory component of ‘bias’
    included in the model and indicated by B in ISO 5725-2:1994 has “zero expectation”
    is evaluated critically. It is found that this condition should apply not to the
    B<sub>k</sub> of each laboratory modelled in ISO 5725-2:1994, but to the expectation
    of the distribution of the B<sub>k</sub> in a comparison when the method of choosing
    the participant laboratories supports the hypothesis that it becomes a ‘random
    effect’. A few related inconsistencies are also discussed.</p>"
