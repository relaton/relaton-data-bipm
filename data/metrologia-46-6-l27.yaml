abstract:
- content: "<p>Supplement 1 to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    states that if a best estimate and associated standard uncertainty are the only
    information available regarding a certain quantity, then, according to the principle
    of maximum entropy, a Gaussian probability distribution with support on the real
    line should be assigned to that quantity. This recommendation holds true if one
    does not know the range of the possible values of the quantity. However, usually
    such a range will also be known. It is shown that in this case a Gaussian distribution
    supported on (−∞, ∞) can be used, but only if the standard uncertainty is sufficiently
    small. Otherwise, the parameters of the distribution have to be computed numerically.</p>"
