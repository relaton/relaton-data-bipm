  content: "<p>Supplement 1 to the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement</italic> states that if a best estimate and associated standard
    uncertainty are the only information available regarding a certain quantity, then,
    according to the principle of maximum entropy, a Gaussian probability distribution
    with support on the real line should be assigned to that quantity. This recommendation
    holds true if one does not know the range of the possible values of the quantity.
    However, usually such a range will also be known. It is shown that in this case
    a Gaussian distribution supported on (−∞, ∞) can be used, but only if the standard
    uncertainty is sufficiently small. Otherwise, the parameters of the distribution
    have to be computed numerically.</p>"
