  content: "<p>The ISO TS21748:2003 statement that the laboratory component of ‘bias’
    included in the model and indicated by <italic>B</italic> in ISO 5725-2:1994 has
    “zero expectation” is evaluated critically. It is found that this condition should
    apply not to the <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> of each laboratory
    modelled in ISO 5725-2:1994, but to the expectation of the distribution of the
    <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> in a comparison when the method
    of choosing the participant laboratories supports the hypothesis that it becomes
    a ‘random effect’. A few related inconsistencies are also discussed.</p>"
