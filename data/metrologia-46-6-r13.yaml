  content: "<p>In March 2009, the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism
    (CCEM) reviewed and re-endorsed its recommendations originally proposed during
    its 25th meeting (April 2007) for changes in the SI electrical units (Recommendation
    E-1). Among its considerations, the document stated that the representation of
    the volt using the Josephson effect and the conventional value of the Josephson
    constant, <italic>K</italic><sub>J−90</sub>, has provided practical, accessible,
    reproducible, low noise and highly linear references worldwide since 1990. We
    summarize the measurement results of comparisons between Josephson voltage standards
    that help support this statement, especially concerning the accuracy and the simplicity
    of the Josephson relationship between voltage and frequency. We also detail a
    list of influence parameters and the ranges over which the Josephson relationship
    has been tested.</p>"
