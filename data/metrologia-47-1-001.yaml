abstract:
- content: "<p>There are currently nine caesium fountain primary frequency standards
    regularly reporting calibrations of International Atomic Time to the Bureau International
    des Poids et Measures (BIPM). An investigation has been carried out using data
    from the BIPM publication Circular T to evaluate the frequency differences among
    these standards and to determine whether these offsets are consistent with the
    stated uncertainties. The fractional frequency uncertainties of some Cs fountains
    are now in the range of 4 × 10<sup>−16</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. The results
    of this investigation show that the standards agree well with each other. An overall
    estimate of the caesium frequency is made using the weighted mean of all the fountains.</p>"
