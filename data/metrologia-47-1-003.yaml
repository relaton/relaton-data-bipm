abstract:
- content: "<p>At the new SPring-8 extreme ultraviolet free-electron laser in Japan,
    a radiometric comparison between a gas-monitor detector from Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt/Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron/Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute
    (Ioffe) and a cryogenic radiometer from National Institute of Advanced Industrial
    Science and Technology was carried out. Radiant power in the range between 30 µW
    and 350 µW was measured at the wavelengths of 51.3 nm, 56.1 nm and 61.2 nm. The
    results obtained with the two different detectors agree within 2.6%, which is
    well below their combined relative standard uncertainty, which varies from 4.1%
    to 5.5%.</p>"
