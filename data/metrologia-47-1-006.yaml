abstract:
- content: "<p>The INRIM standard facility for low airspeed (0.20 m s<sup>−1</sup>
    to 5.00 m s<sup>−1</sup>), called rotating arm (RA), is presented. This is a dragging
    facility, i.e. it is based on the reciprocity principle. This means that the relative
    movement between air and measurement instrument is obtained through the translation
    of the latter through nominally still air. The instrument is mounted on the tip
    of an arm approximately 3.5 m long, which rotates about an axis; measurement of
    the tip velocity is traceable to measurements of length and time primary standards
    because it is obtained through measuring the instrument positioning radius and
    the rotation frequency. The working principle, the design and the measurement
    chain of the RA are described in detail. Because of the movement of the arm, air
    movements arise in the measurement ambient; this can be seen as a systematic error
    connected to the functioning of the system; the methods for correcting this and
    other systematic errors are described in the paper, together with specific details
    and operating procedures aimed at reducing the uncertainty contributions. Finally,
    an evaluation of the uncertainty budget is discussed.</p>"
