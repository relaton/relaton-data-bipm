abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper continues a discussion generated by a recent paper of Hall
    (2008 Metrologia 45 L5–8) regarding the performance of methods of uncertainty
    evaluation. The ‘validity’ of a method of generating intervals of measurement
    uncertainty is identified principally with the frequency with which these intervals
    contain the measurand. Two approaches to the evaluation of such intervals are
    described, and their performances are compared for the simple measurement function
    appearing in Hall's paper. The first is a Bayesian approach, which is consistent
    with the numerical method described in Supplement 1 to the Guide to the Expression
    of Uncertainty in Measurement. The second is an approach based on frequentist
    principles. Simulations with fixed values of the unknown parameters are conducted
    to find the rate at which the methods generate intervals containing the value
    of the measurand and to find the mean widths of the intervals produced. The results
    show that the standard Bayesian procedure and its modifications can perform poorly.
    In contrast, the frequentist procedure achieves the required rate of 0.95 while
    generating intervals of similar width.</p>"
