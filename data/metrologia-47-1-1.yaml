  content: "<p>There are currently nine caesium fountain primary frequency standards
    regularly reporting calibrations of International Atomic Time to the Bureau International
    des Poids et Measures (BIPM). An investigation has been carried out using data
    from the BIPM publication <italic>Circular T</italic> to evaluate the frequency
    differences among these standards and to determine whether these offsets are consistent
    with the stated uncertainties. The fractional frequency uncertainties of some
    Cs fountains are now in the range of 4 × 10<sup>−16</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>−16</sup>.
    The results of this investigation show that the standards agree well with each
    other. An overall estimate of the caesium frequency is made using the weighted
    mean of all the fountains.</p>"
