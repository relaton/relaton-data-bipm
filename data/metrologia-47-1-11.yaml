  content: "<p>ARPANSA has calculated new Monte Carlo corrections for their low and
    medium energy x-ray free-air chambers. The new calculations include a diverging
    beam and details of the limiting aperture. The diverging beam simulations are
    compared with previous parallel beam simulations. The electron loss, scattering
    and fluorescence corrections do not change when beam divergence is included, even
    for the short source–detector distance of 30 cm used in post-2008 low energy calibrations.
    Transmission and scattering from the aperture are significant for both free-air
    chambers and dependent on the beam divergence. The constancy of the correction
    factors with changing air path length was investigated at low energies. In the
    extreme conditions of 100 kV and a distance of 30 cm the correction factors showed
    significant deviation.</p>"
