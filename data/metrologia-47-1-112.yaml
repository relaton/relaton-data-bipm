- content: "<p>Equations (21), (22) and (23) should be corrected by \n \nThe text
    following equation (23) should be replaced by:</p><p>\"The relation between ρ<sub>λ</sub>
    and ρ<sub>550</sub> can be simplified in equation (23) because the reflectance
    factor is considered equal to one and stable over the spectral range from 380
    nm to 780 nm.\"</p>"
