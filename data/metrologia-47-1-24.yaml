  content: "<p>The weighted mean is widely used in combining data sets of experimental
    measurements with a weight proportional to the value of the data number divided
    by the sample variance in a conventional method. However, this standard procedure
    is not appropriate for obtaining the weighted mean frequency of a phase-stabilized
    signal with white phase noise, since the data are autocorrelated. The autocorrelation
    is obtained in the case of white phase noise and a new weighting method is proposed.
    Using this, the uncertainty associated with the weighted mean frequency of a phase-stabilized
    signal with white phase noise is given. The effect of counter dead-time is also
    discussed.</p>"
