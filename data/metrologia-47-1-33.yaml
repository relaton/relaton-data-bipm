  content: "<p>An algorithm of the Monte Carlo method applied to the computation of
    the spectral and total effective emissivity of a specularâ€“diffuse, non-isothermal
    blackbody cavity formed by a cylindrical tube and a flat inclined bottom is described.
    The effect of cavity wall temperature non-uniformity on the cavity radiation characteristics
    is studied for various combinations of the affecting parameters.</p>"
