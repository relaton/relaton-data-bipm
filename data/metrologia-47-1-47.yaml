  content: "<p>The INRIM standard facility for low airspeed (0.20 m s<sup>−1</sup>
    to 5.00 m s<sup>−1</sup>), called <italic>rotating arm</italic> (RA), is presented.
    This is a dragging facility, i.e. it is based on the reciprocity principle. This
    means that the relative movement between air and measurement instrument is obtained
    through the translation of the latter through nominally still air. The instrument
    is mounted on the tip of an arm approximately 3.5 m long, which rotates about
    an axis; measurement of the tip velocity is traceable to measurements of length
    and time primary standards because it is obtained through measuring the instrument
    positioning radius and the rotation frequency. The working principle, the design
    and the measurement chain of the RA are described in detail. Because of the movement
    of the arm, air movements arise in the measurement ambient; this can be seen as
    a systematic error connected to the functioning of the system; the methods for
    correcting this and other systematic errors are described in the paper, together
    with specific details and operating procedures aimed at reducing the uncertainty
    contributions. Finally, an evaluation of the uncertainty budget is discussed.</p>"
