    <p>During the monitoring of the long term stability of two accelerometers intended for use in the CIPM Key Comparison CCAUV.V-K2, significant deviations of the magnitude results of the single-ended transducer were discovered. These deviations depend on whether the calibration was performed on an armature made of beryllium or of ceramic. Further investigations showed that this effect must be attributed to some not yet readily understood dynamic process between the contact surfaces of the accelerometer and the armature. The relative motion underlying the deviations has a significant systematic influence already at 5 kHz and beyond. Therefore, the effect needs to be considered in some way while comparing results within the key comparison, as some laboratories use beryllium armatures and some use ceramic armatures.</p>
    <p>The contribution describes the details and outcome of the investigations performed on the topic so far and is intended to trigger the necessary discussion on consequences and solutions.</p>
