abstract:
- content: "<p>During the monitoring of the long term stability of two accelerometers
    intended for use in the CIPM Key Comparison CCAUV.V-K2, significant deviations
    of the magnitude results of the single-ended transducer were discovered. These
    deviations depend on whether the calibration was performed on an armature made
    of beryllium or of ceramic. Further investigations showed that this effect must
    be attributed to some not yet readily understood dynamic process between the contact
    surfaces of the accelerometer and the armature. The relative motion underlying
    the deviations has a significant systematic influence already at 5 kHz and beyond.
    Therefore, the effect needs to be considered in some way while comparing results
    within the key comparison, as some laboratories use beryllium armatures and some
    use ceramic armatures.</p><p>The contribution describes the details and outcome
    of the investigations performed on the topic so far and is intended to trigger
    the necessary discussion on consequences and solutions.</p>"
