  content: <p>This paper continues a discussion generated by a recent paper of Hall
    (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/45/2/N01">2008
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>45</bold> L5–8</ext-link>) regarding the performance
    of methods of uncertainty evaluation. The ‘validity’ of a method of generating
    intervals of measurement uncertainty is identified principally with the frequency
    with which these intervals contain the measurand. Two approaches to the evaluation
    of such intervals are described, and their performances are compared for the simple
    measurement function appearing in Hall's paper. The first is a Bayesian approach,
    which is consistent with the numerical method described in <italic>Supplement
    1</italic> to the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>.
    The second is an approach based on frequentist principles. Simulations with fixed
    values of the unknown parameters are conducted to find the rate at which the methods
    generate intervals containing the value of the measurand and to find the mean
    widths of the intervals produced. The results show that the standard Bayesian
    procedure and its modifications can perform poorly. In contrast, the frequentist
    procedure achieves the required rate of 0.95 while generating intervals of similar
    width.</p>
