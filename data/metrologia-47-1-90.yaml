abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of the melting temperatures of four Co–C eutectic
    fixed-point cells by using two Pt/Pd thermocouples was performed. The cells are
    usable for the calibration of thermocouples and were constructed in the participating
    laboratories of PTB, NPL, LNE and NMIJ/AIST. The measurements were performed in
    four different high-temperature furnaces but by applying the same measurement
    procedure. In spite of slightly different cell designs and different material
    sources the melting temperatures of the investigated Co–C cells agreed very well
    within their expanded uncertainties of k = 2. Furthermore, the mean maximum difference
    of the melting temperatures of the four Co–C cells measured in different laboratories
    by using different furnaces and Pt/Pd thermocouples was found to be of the order
    of 85 mK (2 µV).</p>"
