abstract:
- content: "<p>A procedure is proposed for linking the results of a RMO key comparison
    to those of a related CIPM key comparison when different travelling standards
    are used. The approach is based on a relationship between unilateral and bilateral
    degrees of equivalence (DOEs) as defined in the MRA, and it assumes that the quantities
    being estimated by the unilateral DOEs for the linking laboratories are the same
    in the CIPM and the RMO key comparisons.</p><p>We show that in the particular
    situation of single stable travelling standards in the two key comparisons the
    assumptions and the results of the approach are in line with previously proposed
    linking procedures which employ an additive shift to the RMO data prior to their
    comparison with the CIPM key comparison reference value. However, the procedure
    put forward here yields (slightly) smaller linking uncertainties compared with
    these methods and, more important, it is generally applicable also in situations
    when several travelling standards are used or when the travelling standard shows
    a drift.</p>"
