    <p>A procedure is proposed for linking the results of a RMO key comparison to those of a related CIPM key comparison when different travelling standards are used. The approach is based on a relationship between unilateral and bilateral degrees of equivalence (DOEs) as defined in the MRA, and it assumes that the quantities being estimated by the unilateral DOEs for the linking laboratories are the same in the CIPM and the RMO key comparisons.</p>
    <p>We show that in the particular situation of single stable travelling standards in the two key comparisons the assumptions and the results of the approach are in line with previously proposed linking procedures which employ an additive shift to the RMO data prior to their comparison with the CIPM key comparison reference value. However, the procedure put forward here yields (slightly) smaller linking uncertainties compared with these methods and, more important, it is generally applicable also in situations when several travelling standards are used or when the travelling standard shows a drift.</p>
