    <p>The supplementary comparison was carried out between CMI, Czech Republic and BIM, NCM Bulgaria in the field of current transformer ratio measurements. The current errors and phase displacement of the traveling standards, current transformers: Tettex 4720, CLA 2.2, CLA 2.2, CLA 3.2, CLB 10, I 523 were determined at 50 Hz, 5 VA burden at unity power factor at ratios: primary (4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 5, 1 and 0.5) A/secondary 5 A. Both participants used their own standard measurement method.</p>
    <p>The obtained results show good agreement for all of the current ratio error measurements (except for the measurements at 2 kA) and for the current phase displacement measurements (the agreement on several measurement points is marginal). The aim of the comparison was to demonstrate the improvement and extension of the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of BIM in this working field and to support the improved CMCs in Appendix C of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
