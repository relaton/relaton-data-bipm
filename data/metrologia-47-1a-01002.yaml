abstract:
- content: "<p>As a part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a
    comparison of the 1.018 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and
    the Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Industrial (INTI), Buenos Aires, Argentina,
    was carried out from August to October 2009.</p><p>The final result of the comparison
    is presented as the difference between the value assigned to DC voltage standard
    by INTI, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at INTI,  U<sub>INTI</sub>, and that
    assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM,  U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of
    the 17th of September 2009:</p><p>U<sub>INTI</sub> −  U<sub>BIPM</sub> = − 0.01
    μV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 0.03 μV, at 1.018 V \n U<sub>INTI</sub> −  U<sub>BIPM</sub>
    = − 0.24 μV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 0.38 μV, at 10 V</p><p>where  u<sub>c</sub> is the
    combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including
    the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at INTI, based
    on  K<sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>Main
    text.\nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database
    \ kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for
    publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
