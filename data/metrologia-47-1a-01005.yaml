    <p>This report describes the results obtained from a NIMT (Thailand)–BIPM bilateral comparison of 10 kΩ resistance standards in 2009. The comparison was carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.b. Two BIPM 10 kΩ travelling standards of SR104 type were calibrated first at the BIPM, then at the NMIT and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability of the transfer standards was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer was smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations. The mean difference between the NIMT and the BIPM calibrations was found to be significantly larger than the expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the comparison. However, this exercise allowed previously undetected sources of errors to be detected in the NIMT facility. A new bilateral comparison can be organized as soon as these problems are fixed.</p>
