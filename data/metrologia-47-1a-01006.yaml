- content: |-
    <p>Twenty-four national metrology institutes, among them 22 EURAMET members, participated in the comparison EUROMET.EM-K2 aimed at evaluating the degrees of equivalence of the measurements of 10 MΩ and 1 GΩ resistance standards. The link to the CCEM comparison CCEM-K2 and the degrees of equivalence with respect to the key comparison reference value were also evaluated. With three exceptions at 10 MΩ, all results supplied by the participants agreed with the comparison reference value within the expanded uncertainty.</p><p>The method of constrained least squares was applied to calculate the comparison reference value. This method has proven to be useful in this analysis, because it provides a single, consistent and transparent approach for the determination of the key values of this measurement comparison involving multiple artefacts and overlapping loops.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
