    <p>We report the results of an international comparison of measurements of radio frequency voltage in the frequency range 1 MHz to 1 GHz. This comparison was performed as a Key Comparison under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM) of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM). Participating laboratories were the designated national metrology institutes (NMIs) for their respective countries.</p><p>Main text.
