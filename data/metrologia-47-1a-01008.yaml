    <p>A key comparison of resistance standards at 100 Ω began in 2003. The pilot laboratory, 26 national metrological institutes and the BIPM participated in that comparison. The results of all laboratories show good equivalence with the comparison reference value. It can also be concluded that the results of laboratories, which directly derive their unit of resistance from the quantum Hall effect, agree within ±3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. This is less than one order of magnitude worse than a direct comparison of QHR-systems and limited by the transportability of the transfer standards. The results have also been linked to the corresponding CIPM comparison CCEM.K-10.</p>
