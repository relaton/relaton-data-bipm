abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the Hellenic Institute of Metrology (EIM), Greece, in March 2010. For this exercise, the option B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol was applied, in which the BIPM only provides a reference voltage that has to be measured by the EIM using its Josephson voltage standard and its own measuring  device. The results of the two participants are in very good agreement and the overall relative standard uncertainty is 2.0 parts in 10<sup>10</sup>.</p><p>Main text.
