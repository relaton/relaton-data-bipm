    <p>A measurement comparison of scattering parameters has been carried out between nineteen national metrology institutes in coaxial line using 50 Ω Type N precision connectors at frequencies between 2 GHz and 18 GHz. The identification of this intercomparison is CCEM.RF-K5b.CL in the BIPM key comparison database. Seven devices have been measured: three attenuators (3 dB, 20 dB and 50 dB), two matched terminations (one male, one female) and two mismatched terminations (one male, one female). The National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) acted as the pilot laboratory for the comparison. The report contains the results of the measurements made at 2 GHz, 9 GHz and 18 GHz for a selection of the measured scattering parameters, chosen to give a sample of a low-, medium- and high-loss transmission coefficient, a nominally zero reflection coefficient and a non-zero reflection coefficient.</p><p>Main text.
