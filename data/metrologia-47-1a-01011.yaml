    <p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison of the measurements on an inductive voltage divider within the framework of EURAMET. The aim of the project is a comparison of AC voltage ratio measurements between INM, Romania, and VSL, the Netherlands.</p>
    <p>Measurements of the decade ratios 0.1, 0.2, ... 0.9 were performed at the following frequencies and voltages: 55 Hz/5 V, 400 Hz/10 V and 1 kHz/10 V.</p>
    <p>The agreement between the results from both laboratories is well within 0.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> V/V for the in-phase ratio deviations and within 1.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup> V/V for the quadrature deviations.</p>
