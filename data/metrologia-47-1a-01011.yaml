    <p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison of the measurements on an inductive voltage divider within the framework of EURAMET. The aim of the project is a comparison of AC voltage ratio measurements between INM, Romania, and VSL, the Netherlands.</p><p>Measurements of the decade ratios 0.1, 0.2,... 0.9 were performed at the following frequencies and voltages: 55 Hz/5 V, 400 Hz/10 V and 1 kHz/10 V.</p><p>The agreement between the results from both laboratories is well within 0.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> V/V for the in-phase ratio deviations and within 1.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup> V/V for the quadrature deviations.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EURAMET, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
