    <p>This report describes the results of a bilateral comparison of capacitance between the NIST (United States) and the BIPM carried out in 2007–2008. Four 10 pF travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of one month, then for a similar period at the NIST, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1592 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 100 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM K14.a.</p>
    <p>The BIPM results are based on the conventional value of the von Klitzing constant,  <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub>. Those from the NIST are traceable to a calculable capacitor. The uncertainty of the comparison includes therefore the standard uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> that applies to the use of the quantum Hall effect as a representation of the ohm.</p>
    <p>The NIST and the BIPM measurements were found to be in agreement, with a mean difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95% confidence,  <italic>k</italic> = 2) of the comparison, 2.2 × 10<sup>−7</sup>. This final uncertainty was dominated by the uncertainty included for the use of  <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub>, not by the uncertainty of either set measurements or the transport of the standards.</p>
