    <p>This report gives the results of a bilateral comparison of capacitance between the CMI (Czech Republic) and the BIPM carried out in 2009. One 100 pF travelling standard belonging to the CMI was used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standard was measured first at the CMI for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIPM, and finally again at the CMI. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b.</p><p>The results from the CMI and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95% confidence, k = 2) of 2.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
