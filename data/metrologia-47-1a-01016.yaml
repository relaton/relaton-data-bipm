    <p>The international key comparison APMP.EM-K9 of AC–DC high voltage transfer standards with 12 participants was carried out from June 2000 to January 2004. This comparison offers the same range and frequencies as BIPM key comparison  CCEM-K9, voltages at 500 V and 1000 V, frequency from 1 kHz to 100 kHz. This comparison provides the national metrology institutes (NMIs) of the APMP member economies with an opportunity to link the values of their standards for AC–DC transfer difference to the international reference values.</p><p>The results of the majority of the participating NMIs show an agreement with the reference value within the associated expanded uncertainty given by the individual NMI. The agreement of the results and the tables of the degree of equivalence of the participants are included. The results have been linked to the key comparison CCEM-K9.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
