    <p>As a part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison of the 1.018 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and of the National Standards Authority of Ireland–National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI–NML), Dublin, Ireland, was carried out from March to April 2010.</p>
    <p>Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards were transported by freight to NSAI–NML. At NSAI–NML, the reference standard for DC voltage is maintained at the 10 V level by means of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic voltage standards. The output EMF of each travelling standard, at the 10 V output terminals, was measured by direct comparison with the group standard. Measurements of the output EMF of the travelling standards at the 1.018 V output terminals were made using a potentiometer, standardized against the local 10 V reference standard. At the BIPM, the travelling standards were calibrated at both voltages before and after the measurements at NSAI–NML, using the BIPM Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages on internal temperature and ambient pressure.</p>
    <p>The comparison results show that the voltage standards maintained by NSAI–NML and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated expanded uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p>
