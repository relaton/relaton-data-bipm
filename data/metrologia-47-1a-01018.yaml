    <p>The APMP international comparison of ac–dc transfer standards at the lowest attainable level of uncertainty, APMP.EM-K6a, started in 2000 and concluded in 2003. This comparison has offered the same range and frequencies as the key comparison CCEM-K6a with the view of providing the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of the APMP member economies with an opportunity to link the values of their standards for ac–dc transfer difference to the international reference values. The ac–dc difference of the travelling standard was measured with 3 V applied at standard frequencies of 1 kHz, 20 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz, and optional frequencies of 50 kHz and 500 kHz.</p>
    <p>The travelling standard has not been damaged and has shown excellent stability. The results submitted by the overwhelming majority of the participants lie well within the reported uncertainty. At the standard frequencies the results have been linked to those of the CCEM-K6a key comparison.</p>
