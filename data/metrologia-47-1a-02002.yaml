    <p>An international comparison of spectral responsivity in the near infrared region, 900 nm to 1600 nm, designated CCPR-K2.a, has been conducted under the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) as one of the key comparisons to support the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA). This comparison was participated in by 15 laboratories and was piloted by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The comparison was carried out through calibration of a group of transfer standard detectors, which were indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photodiodes with sapphire windows, mounted with a thermistor. The comparison was organized in a star pattern, and conducted in four groups of participants. The report describes in detail the measurements made at NIST and summarizes the reports submitted by the participants. Key comparison reference values and degrees of equivalence have been determined from the comparison results.</p><p>Main text.
