    <p>The EUROMET.PR-S2 intercomparison of Radiant Power of High Power Lasers for five measurands was carried as a combined round-robin/star type comparison. In total nine participants took part, five from Europe (national metrology institutes of France, Germany (pilot), Great Britain, Romania, Sweden) and four outside Europe (national metrology institutes of Australia, Japan, South Africa and The United States of America). Therefore, this comparison can be considered as a worldwide one. The measurements took place from January 2005 to September 2007.</p>
    <p>All participants supplied detailed reports of their measurements including full uncertainty statements. All measurement results reported by the participants were used for the intercomparison and no measurement was subject to rejection. The analysis method introduced in section 6 follows the Guidelines for CCPR Comparison Report Preparation and has been accepted by all participants.</p>
    <p>For the calculation of the supplementary key comparison reference value no participant had to be excluded and the weighted mean with cut-off used here has been supported by all participants.</p>
    <p>The unilateral degrees of equivalence (DoE) calculated for each participant are approximately 63% consistent with their uncertainties at the  <italic>k</italic> = 2 level and approximately 81% consistent within  <italic>k</italic> = 3.</p>
