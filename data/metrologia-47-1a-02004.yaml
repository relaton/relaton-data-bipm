    <p>Following the decisions of the 1994 meeting of the Consultative Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR), BIPM acted as pilot laboratory for an international comparison of cryogenic radiometers, later designated as a supplementary comparison CCPR-S3, carried out using silicon trap detectors as transfer devices. This comparison was completed in February 1999.</p>
    <p>After the completion of this comparison and the publication of the final report, the National Metrology Centre of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (NMC-A*STAR) of Singapore expressed a wish to demonstrate its primary spectral responsivity measurement capabilities, in support of its CMC claims, through linkage to the CCPR-S3 comparison. NPL offered to organize a bilateral comparison with NMC-A*STAR following a similar protocol to that used in the original comparison.</p>
    <p>The comparison was carried out by using three silicon trap detectors as transfer devices, to be calibrated at a number of laser wavelengths at NPL and NMC-A*STAR from 2005 to 2007.</p>
    <p>The results of the comparison demonstrate agreement between NMC-A*STAR and CCPR-S3 comparison reference values, in the selected wavelength range, to better than 6.8 parts in 10<sup>4</sup> with a combined uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 1) of 2.2 parts in 10<sup>4</sup> or better.</p>
