    <p>Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI) conducted a bilateral comparison on spectral irradiance over the spectral region from 250 nm to 2500 nm in 2008. The aim of this comparison was to assess the equivalence of the spectral irradiance scales between the two laboratories and to link the KRISS spectral irradiance scale to the results of key comparison CCPR-K1.a carried out in the years 2000â€“2003. The technical protocol was approved by the CCPR Working Group on Key Comparisons in April 2008. KRISS acted as the pilot to reduce the workload of VNIIOFI as the link laboratory. PTB acted as the neutral partner to ensure blindness of the comparison results. PTB collected the measurement results from and sent them back to both participants. KRISS prepared this report based on the measurement results distributed by PTB. The spectral irradiances measured by KRISS and VNIIOFI agreed within the standard uncertainties (k = 1) from 250 nm to 2500 nm. The unilateral degrees of equivalence of KRISS were calculated using the unilateral degrees of equivalence of VNIIOFI to link the KRISS spectral irradiance scale to the key comparison CCPR-K1.a. The uncertainties of the unilateral degrees of equivalence of KRISS were determined using the uncertainties of KRISS and VNIIOFI measurements and the uncertainties of the unilateral degrees of equivalence of VNIIOFI, and taking into account the correlation of VNIIOFI measurements between the CCPR key and this bilateral comparison.</p><p>Main text.
