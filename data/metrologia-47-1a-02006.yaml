    <p>We present results of a bilateral supplementary comparison, between NPL and CMI, of cryogenic radiometers, using silicon trap detectors as the transfer standard. The comparison was based on the technical protocol of the CCPR-S3 comparison (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://kcdb.bipm.org/appendixB/KCDB_ApB_info.asp?cmp_idy=495&amp;cmp_cod=CCPR-S3&amp;search=2&amp;cmp_cod_search=ccpr-s3&amp;page=1&amp;met_idy=&amp;bra_idy=&amp;epo_idy=&amp;cmt_idy=&amp;ett_idy_org=&amp;cou_cod=">BIPM Report BIPM-2000/9</ext-link>).</p>
    <p>The results of this comparison demonstrate agreement between CMI and the CCPR-S3 comparison reference values, in the selected wavelength range, to better than 2.7 parts in 10<sup>4</sup> with a combined standard uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 1) of 2.2 parts per 10<sup>4</sup> or better.</p>
