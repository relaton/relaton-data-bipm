    <p>In the framework of the CIPM MRA, a first COOMET comparison "Comparison of the ITS-90 realizations in the range from 0.01 °C to 429.7485 °C (from the triple point of water to the freezing point of zinc)", registered in the KCDB under the identifier "<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/45/1A/03005">COOMET.T-K3</ext-link>", was carried out in 2005–2007.</p>
    <p>Four national metrology institutes took part in this comparison: VNIIM (Russian Federation), SMU (Slovakia), BelGIM (Republic of Belarus) and NSC IM (Ukraine), and two of them (VNIIM and SMU) ensured the linkage with key comparisons <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/39/2/7">CCT-K3</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/39/1A/6">CCT-K4</ext-link>, in order to disseminate the metrological equivalence to the measurement standards of NSC IM and BelGIM.</p>
    <p>NSC IM, however, had to withdraw its results, and at the meeting of Technical Committee T-10 of COOMET it was decided to carry out a supplementary bilateral comparison between VNIIM and the NSC IM for realization of the ITS-90 in the same range of temperature. This was registered in the KCDB under the identifier COOMET.T-S1 and measurements were performed in 2008–2009.</p>
    <p>From the results presented in this report, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the COOMET supplementary comparison COOMET.T-S1 demonstrates the CMC uncertainties claimed by the NSC IM for the melting point of gallium 0.236 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2), and the freezing points of indium 1.040 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2), tin 0.858 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2) and zinc 0.944 mK (<italic>k</italic> = 2).</p>
    <p><italic>In September 2012 the Working Group on key Comparisons (WG 7) of the CCT upgraded this comparison to a COOMET key comparison of the 'CCT-K3' type. It is now identified as COOMET.T-K3.1.</italic></p>
    <p><bold><italic>In April 2013 this report was superseded by item <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/50/1A/03006">03006</ext-link> in the Technical Supplement of 2013.</italic></bold></p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
