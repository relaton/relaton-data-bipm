    <p>At its meeting in October 2003, the EUROMET Technical Committee for Length, TC-L, decided upon a key comparison on diameter standards, numbered EUROMET.L-K4. Due to the large number of participants, it was decided to have two groups in the project. There were 18 paticipants in Group 2. The comparison was registered as EUROMET project 812.</p><p>This report describes the results of measurements of five diamater standards (two rings, two plugs and a sphere). This comparison was carried out during the period from June 2005 to April 2009.</p><p>The measurand was the diameter of each gauge at 20 ºC and corrected to zero force and also the roundness of the gauges and the straightness of the cylindrical gauges. The results of the roundness measurements of the sphere were considered as evidence for proving CMC claims for roundness service. Participants were invited to measure the roundness of the sphere at 500, 150 and 50 UPR.</p><p>The results obtained show a good overall agreement of measurement results with the calculated mean values.</p><p>Main text.
