  content: "<p>The aim of the project was to ensure the reliability of length measurement
    unit transfer in the field of measurement of deviations from straightness and
    flatness and to confirm the claimed measurement capabilities of the national state
    measurement standards of Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kazakhstan and Russia.</p>\n<p>The
    comparison was conducted on a granite bridge of the Kazakhstan measurement standard
    by the measurement of its deviations from straightness using instruments which
    are parts of the national measurement standards of comparison participants and
    which they brought.</p>\n<p>The measurement results were processed, the uncertainty
    budgets and the confidence levels were determined, and the results were analyzed.</p>\n<p>In
    summary: \n <list list-type=\"unordered\">\n <list-item><p>The comparison was
    successfully carried out and the obtained results confirmed the measuring capabilities
    claimed by the participants.</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>The reference value
    was calculated using arithmetical mean, weighted arithmetical mean and median
    of deviations from straightness of the bridge. The value 6.86 µm was chosen as
    the reference value with an associated expanded uncertainty of 0.52 µm. The deviation
    of the measurement result from the reference value of each comparison participant
    is, in absolute value, always smaller than or equal to the expanded uncertainty
    of the participant.</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>The analysis of pair-wise
    equivalence shows that the estimate of difference of measurement results (systematic
    bias) of each possible pair of comparison participants does not exceed the expanded
    uncertainty of this estimate.</p></list-item>\n <list-item><p>The obtained results
    confirm the equivalence of participating laboratories. The results of additional
    comparisons which have been carried out can be presented together with those of
    the COOMET and BIPM ones.</p></list-item>\n</list></p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
