    <p>The aim of the project was to ensure the reliability of length measurement unit transfer in the field of measurement of deviations from straightness and flatness and to confirm the claimed measurement capabilities of the national state measurement standards of Republic of Belarus, Republic of Kazakhstan and Russia.</p><p>The comparison was conducted on a granite bridge of the Kazakhstan measurement standard by the measurement of its deviations from straightness using instruments which are parts of the national measurement standards of comparison participants and which they brought.</p><p>The measurement results were processed, the uncertainty budgets and the confidence levels were determined, and the results were analyzed.</p><p>In summary:<p>The comparison was successfully carried out and the obtained results confirmed the measuring capabilities claimed by the participants.</p><p>The reference value was calculated using arithmetical mean, weighted arithmetical mean and median of deviations from straightness of the bridge. The value 6.86 µm was chosen as the reference value with an associated expanded uncertainty of 0.52 µm. The deviation of the measurement result from the reference value of each comparison participant is, in absolute value, always smaller than or equal to the expanded uncertainty of the participant.</p><p>The analysis of pair-wise equivalence shows that the estimate of difference of measurement results (systematic bias) of each possible pair of comparison participants does not exceed the expanded uncertainty of this estimate.</p><p>The obtained results confirm the equivalence of participating laboratories. The results of additional comparisons which have been carried out can be presented together with those of the COOMET and BIPM ones.</p></p><p>Main text.
