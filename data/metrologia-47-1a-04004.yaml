    <p>TThe COOMET Project No 314/UA/04, 'Comparison of the involute surface standards', KCDB Reference COOMET.L-S6, was organized by TC 1.5 'Length and Angle' of COOMET. This supplementary comparison started in September 2004 and finished in July 2007. It was piloted by the National Scientific Centre 'Institute of Metrology', Kharkov, Ukraine, and VNIIMS, Russia, participated in the comparison.</p><p>The comparison standard of NSC 'Institute of Metrology' was carried to the place of the comparison (VNIIMS) by NCS IM attendant specialists as personal baggage, where it was measured by reference to the VNIIMS measuring instrument of parameters of evolvent surfaces, VNIIMS ZMC-550.</p><p>The pilot laboratory processed the data for estimating measurement result differences between the measuring instruments of NSC IM and VNIIMS. The following parameters were determined: deviation from profile form, deviation from profile position and full profile error.</p><p>The conclusion is that the equivalence of the reference installations for parameter measurements of involute surfaces of NSC 'Institute of Metrology', Ukraine, and of VNIIMS, Russia, is sufficient and constitutes an appropriate basis for mutual recognition of measurement results.</p><p>Main text.
