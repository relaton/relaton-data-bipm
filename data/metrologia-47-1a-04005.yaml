    <p>Measurements have been made at four European national metrology institutes (NMIs) in the subject field of angle measurement. Specifically, each NMI made measurements of two precision polygons: a six-sided polygon made of glass with aluminium-coated faces and a twelve-sided polygon, made of steel. Each participant used a different device to rotate the polygons. Among the participants, three different models of autocollimator were used to measure the deviation from nominal angle (two participants used the same model). The report lists the results obtained by the individual participants, as well as an analysis of the results and their uncertainties, based on calculation of the weighted means and  <italic>E<sub>n</sub></italic> values. The results are in good agreement with one another.</p>
