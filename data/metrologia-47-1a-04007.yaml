    <p>A bilateral comparison has been undertaken between two European national metrology institutes (NMIs) in the subject field of squareness measurement. Specifically, both NMIs made measurements of a rectangular squareness standard, made of granite. Both participants made measurements of the internal angle at a defined position along the measuring faces, as well as measurement of the corresponding straightness profiles on the two adjoining sides. The report lists the results obtained by both participants, as well as an analysis of the results and their uncertainties. The results are in good agreement with one another. This bilateral comparison followed the same technical protocol as a previous supplementary comparison (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/42/1A/04001">EUROMET.L-S10</ext-link>).</p>
