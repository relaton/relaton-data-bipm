    <p>A bilateral comparison has been undertaken between two European national metrology institutes (NMIs) in the subject field of squareness measurement. Specifically, both NMIs made measurements of a cylindrical squareness standard, made of steel. Both participants made measurements of the internal angles at several positions around the circumference, as well as measurement of the corresponding straightness profiles. The report lists the results obtained by both participants, as well as an analysis of the results and their uncertainties. The results are in good agreement with one another. This bilateral comparison followed the same technical protocol as a previous supplementary comparison (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/42/1A/04001">EUROMET.L-S10</ext-link>).</p>
