    <p>Lasers from nine national metrology institutes (NMIs) were compared as part of the CCL-K11 ongoing key comparison, initiated by the 13th meeting of the Comité Consultative des Longeurs (CCL) in 2007. The absolute frequency of the f component of the R(127) 11–5 transition of molecular iodine was measured for these lasers following the technical protocol for CCL-K11. The results of these measurements are compiled in the present report.</p><p>Main text.
