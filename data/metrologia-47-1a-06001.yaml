- content: |-
    <p>Since 1976, twelve national metrology institutes (NMIs) have submitted 29 samples of known activity of<sup>22</sup>Na to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The activities ranged from about 300 kBq to 20 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for nine NMIs. A graphical presentation is also given of this BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Na-22 comparison.</p><p>Main text.

    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
