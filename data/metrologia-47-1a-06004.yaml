- content: |-
    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), United Kingdom and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made in<sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation in September 2007. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the NPL and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0011 (0.0038).</p><p>The degrees of equivalence between the NPL and the other participants in the key comparison have been calculated and the results are presented in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
