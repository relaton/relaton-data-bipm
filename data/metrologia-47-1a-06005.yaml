- content: |-
    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Research Council (NRC), Canada, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in May 2009. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the NRC and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0032 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.8 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The result of the previous direct comparison in<sup>60</sup>Co γ rays, made in 1998 and modified in 2007 was 1.0025 (27).</p><p>The degrees of equivalence between the NRC and the other participants in the key comparison have been calculated and the results are presented in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
