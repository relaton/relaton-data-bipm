    <p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen (BEV), Austria, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the  <sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beam of the BIPM in March 2009. The result, expressed as ratios of the BEV and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0041 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The result of the earlier direct comparison in  <sup>137</sup>Cs γ rays, made in 1995, was 0.9961 (28); taking into account the changes made recently to both standards, the 1995 result becomes 1.0035 (24), in agreement with the present comparison result.</p>
    <p>The degrees of equivalence between the BEV and the other participants in the key comparison have been calculated and the results are presented in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
