    <p>Measurements of the Cs-137 specific activity in artificial volume material of water density were performed in nine laboratories with the HPGe spectrometry technique. Analysis of the gamma radiation absorption in the measured material and in the most important substances for environmental monitoring (food, water, biological materials, soils) confirmed Compton scattering as the main mechanism of interaction. The list of CMCs supported by the comparison is suggested in the report of this comparison.</p><p>Main text.
