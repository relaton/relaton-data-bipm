abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Since 2006, the Institutul de Fizica si Inginerie Nucleara – 'Horia Hulubei' (Romania), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (USA) and the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen (Austria) have each submitted samples of known activity of<sup>60</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR). The values of the activity submitted were between 180 kBq and 3.1 MBq. The key comparison results now include updated results for these three national metrology institutes with the identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60. The key comparison reference value has been re-evaluated following the recommendations of the CCRI(II) and the matrix of degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database now contains nineteen results as some very early results have now been excluded, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60.</p><p>Main text.

    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
