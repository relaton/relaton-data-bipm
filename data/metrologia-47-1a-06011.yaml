- content: |-
    <p>In 2006, the Ceský Metrologický Institut/Czech Metrological Institute – Inspectorate for Ionizing Radiation (CMI-IIR) submitted an ampoule of known activity of<sup>56</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activity was about 6.7 MBq. The degrees of equivalence between each of the four national metrology institute results now measured in the SIR and the re-evaluated key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given. The comparison identifier is BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-56.</p><p>Main text.
