    <p>A comparison of 24.5 keV neutron fluence standards was organized by Section III (Neutron Measurements) of the Comité Consultatif des Rayonnements Ionisants, (CCRI). The exercise involved the circulation of a set of three different-diameter Bonner spheres for calibration in fields with energies around 24.5 keV. The fields were produced using four different methods of neutron production.</p>
    <p>The responses (counts per unit neutron fluence) of the individual spheres were initially determined for the neutron energy of the production method, or methods, employed. To derive the 24.5 keV responses, it was necessary to make corrections for spectral effects, and these were achieved by using response functions for the spheres calculated using the code MCNP. The results demonstrate good consistency within the estimated uncertainties (ranging from about 5% to 10% at the 95% confidence level) between the results reported by all the participants.</p>
