    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), The Netherlands, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in September 2005. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for three transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the VSL and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9985 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The latest result agrees with the result of the previous comparison in<sup>60</sup>Co γ rays, made in 1996 and updated for recent changes made to the standards to give a value of 0.9982(37).</p><p>The degrees of equivalence between the VSL and the other participants in the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K1 have been calculated and the results are presented in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
