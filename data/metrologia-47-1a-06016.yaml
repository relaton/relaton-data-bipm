    <p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the  <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in May 2009 under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the NRC and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9980(52). This result replaces the 1998 NRC value of 0.9976(51) in this key comparison. The degrees of equivalence between the NRC and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the ten national metrology institutes (NMIs) with published results that have taken part in the ongoing comparison for absorbed dose to water. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
