abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the Bundesamt
    für Eich- und Vermessungswesen (BEV), Austria, and of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam
    of the BIPM in March 2009 under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4.
    The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients measured for two
    transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the BEV and the BIPM standards
    for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9996(37). This result replaces the 1994 BEV value
    of 0.9990(43) in this key comparison. The degrees of equivalence between the BEV
    and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated and the results
    are given in the form of a matrix for the ten national metrology institutes (NMIs)
    that have published results in this ongoing comparison for absorbed dose to water.
    A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main
    text of this paper, click on   Final Report. Note that this text is that which
    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section
    I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
