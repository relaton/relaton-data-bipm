    <p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Korea, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the  <sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beam of the BIPM in August 2010. The result, expressed as a ratio of the KRISS and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9986 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
