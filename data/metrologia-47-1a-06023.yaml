    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the ARPANSA and the BIPM in the low-energy x ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the combined standard uncertainty of 7.0 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> for the 10 kV radiation quality and 3.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> for all other beam qualities. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
