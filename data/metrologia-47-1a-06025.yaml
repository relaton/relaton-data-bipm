    <p>A comparison of the dosimetry for high-energy accelerator photon beams was carried out between the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in June 2009. The comparison was based on the determination of absorbed dose to water for three radiation qualities. The comparison result, reported as a ratio of the NRC and the BIPM evaluations, is 0.997 at 6 MV, 1.001 at 10 MV and 0.994 at 25 MV, each with a relative standard uncertainty of 6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. This result is the first of the ongoing BIPM.RI(I)-K6 comparison.</p>
