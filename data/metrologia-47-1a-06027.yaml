- content: |-
    <p>In 2009, the first comparison of activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA. An ampoule containing about 30 kBq of<sup>99m</sup>Tc traceable to the NIST primary standard was measured in the SIRTI for more than three half-lives. The influence of the<sup>99</sup>Mo impurity was negligible. The comparison, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m, is linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparison, and the degrees of equivalence with the key comparison reference value and between the present NIST result and the six participants in the K1 comparison have been evaluated. Consistency between the USA and European activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc is demonstrated.</p><p>Main text.
