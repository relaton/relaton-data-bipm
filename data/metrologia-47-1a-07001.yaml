    <p>The COOMET.M.M-K1 key comparison is an international COOMET comparison of 1 kg stainless steel mass standards, using two travelling artefacts from SMU, Slovakia. Thanks to the participation of the PTB in this comparison, it was made possible to link the results to those of the corresponding CCM key comparison, namely  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/41/1A/07002/">CCM.M-K1</ext-link>, thus adding new values of degrees of equivalence for BelGIM (Belarus), NSC IM (Ukraine), PTB (Germany), SMU (Slovakia), VMT/VMC (Lithuania) and VNIIM (Russia), on the CCM.M-K1 graph of equivalence.</p>
