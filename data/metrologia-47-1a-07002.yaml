- content: |-
    <p>At its meeting in October 2006 in Querétaro, Mexico, the Interamerican Metrology System (SIM) Technical Committee for Fluid Flow (TCFF) approved a Regional Key Comparison for Volume of Liquids at 20 L and 100 mL, to be piloted by the national metrology institute of Mexico (CENAM). The objective of this comparison was to demonstrate the degree of equivalence of the volume measurement standards held at national measurement institutes (NMIs) and to provide supporting evidence for the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) claimed by the participating laboratories in the Americas.</p><p>During the comparison, one of the pycnometers suffered irreversible damage, and degrees of equivalence for volume at 100 mL were calculated using the results obtained with one single pycnometer (TS 03.04.04).</p><p>Conclusions are as follows:<p>The transfer standards for SIM.M.FF-K4 exhibited global good performance all the way along, both in terms of stability and repeatability.</p><p>Degrees of equivalence have been produced for volumes at 20 L and at 100 mL.</p><p>The best estimation of the measurands, as reported by the participants, shows a general agreement better than ±0.0070% for volume of liquids at 100 mL and 20 L.</p><p>It is advisable to review the uncertainty analysis of some participants.</p><p>New CMC entries for some NMIs should take into account the information presented in this Report.</p></p><p>Main text.
