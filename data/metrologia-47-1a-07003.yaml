abstract:
- content: "<p>This report presents the results obtained for a SIM supplementary comparison
    between CENAM-Mexico and INMETRO-Brazil of volume of solids by hydrostatic weighing
    measurements. A scheme for measurements and the systems used by the national metrology
    institutes are presented in this document. The travelling standards were two spheres
    made of different materials (stainless steel and glass) with approximated diameter
    of 15 mm each. The small size of the travelling standards circulated gave special
    problems to participating laboratories, but the results reported are consistent.</p><p>
