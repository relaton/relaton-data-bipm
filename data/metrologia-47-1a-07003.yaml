    <p>This report presents the results obtained for a SIM supplementary comparison between CENAM-Mexico and INMETRO-Brazil of volume of solids by hydrostatic weighing measurements. A scheme for measurements and the systems used by the national metrology institutes are presented in this document. The travelling standards were two spheres made of different materials (stainless steel and glass) with approximated diameter of 15 mm each. The small size of the travelling standards circulated gave special problems to participating laboratories, but the results reported are consistent.</p>
