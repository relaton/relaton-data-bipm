    <p>This report describes a CCM key comparison in capillary viscometry at six national metrology institutes, which was carried out between October 2008 and January 2009. This comparison is a follow-up of key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/46/1A/07003">CCM.V-K2</ext-link> carried out in 2006–2007. It was carried out at the request of laboratories that were not able to participate in key comparison CCM.V-K2 or reported unsatisfactory results.</p>
    <p>The objective was to compare viscosity measurements made at 20 ºC, 60 ºC and 100 ºC using a standard fluid with nominal viscosities at these temperatures of 1300 mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, 150 mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and 40 mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.</p>
    <p>For 20 °C and 100 ºC, the results from two participants, PTB and Cannon, were used to link the measurement results of this key comparison to those of key comparison CCM.V-K2 and thus calculate the degrees of equivalence with respect to the key comparison reference value of CCM.V-K2. Since in key comparison CCM.V-K2 no measurements were carried out at 60 ºC, at this temperature no linkage could be provided. Also no reference value could be computed at 60 ºC, because there are only three participants with independent measurement scales, one of which has withdrawn a clearly outlying result at this temperature.</p>
    <p>For 20 °C and 100 ºC, none of the reported results show a significant difference from the key comparison reference value of CCM.V-K2.</p>
