abstract:
- content: "<p>An interlaboratory comparison (Euramet Project 1039) of three absolute
    gravimeters was carried out between the national metrology institutes of Luxembourg,
    Belgium and Switzerland (University of Luxembourg/ECGS, Royal Observatory of Belgium
    and Federal Office for Metrology METAS). The comparison was hosted in the Underground
    Laboratory for Geodynamics in Walferdange. The obtained results confirm a perfect
    agreement between the instruments used with respective expanded uncertainties
    ( k  = 2) of 4.25 ÂµGal. Finally, a link to the Euramet project 1030 shows that
    the three gravimeters are coherent with the 19 other gravimeters.</p><p> Main
