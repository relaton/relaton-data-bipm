    <p>An interlaboratory comparison (Euramet Project 1039) of three absolute gravimeters was carried out between the national metrology institutes of Luxembourg, Belgium and Switzerland (University of Luxembourg/ECGS, Royal Observatory of Belgium and Federal Office for Metrology METAS). The comparison was hosted in the Underground Laboratory for Geodynamics in Walferdange. The obtained results confirm a perfect agreement between the instruments used with respective expanded uncertainties (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of 4.25 ÂµGal. Finally, a link to the Euramet project 1030 shows that the three gravimeters are coherent with the 19 other gravimeters.</p>
