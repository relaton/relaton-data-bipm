    <p>The purpose of the EURAMET supplementary bilateral comparison EURAMET.M.T-S1 was to compare the capabilities of reference-type static torque measuring machines. The pilot laboratory was the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany); the other participant was the Egyptian national metrology institute NIS.</p>
    <p>Four very stable torque transducers with well-known properties and measuring ranges of 5 N m, 10 N m, 200 N m and 1000 N m were used as travelling standards. The measurements at the participating laboratories were carried out between May and August 2008. According to the technical protocol, two torque steps, corresponding to 100% (all transducers) and 50% (10 N m, 1000 N m), 40% (200 N m) or 20% (5 N m) of the transducer's capacity, had to be measured both in clockwise and anticlockwise directions. Corrections were applied to the results reported by the participants taking into account the use of different amplifiers and the environmental conditions in the laboratories (temperature and relative humidity of the ambient air).</p>
    <p>For each of the transducers, the two torque steps and both senses of direction of the torque vector, a comparison reference value was calculated.</p>
    <p>The agreement between the results is very good. The smallest expanded relative uncertainty of the machines stated by the participants is 2 × 10<sup>−4</sup> for machines with horizontal axis. The results of the comparison support this uncertainty statement. The 5 N m transducer showed deviating results in the 100% step for clockwise torque, whereas the results for anticlockwise torque are also in good agreement. The reason for this deviation is probably caused by an unstable transducer or an erroneous measurement.</p>
