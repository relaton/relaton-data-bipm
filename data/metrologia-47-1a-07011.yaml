    <p>The results of the SIM.M.D-S2 bilateral comparison between INRIM–Italy and INMETRO–Brazil are summarized in this report. The aims of this comparison were to check the stated uncertainty levels and the degrees of equivalence between the two institutes on the calibration of hydrometers for liquid density in the range of  800 kg m<sup>−3</sup>  to 1000 kg m<sup>−3</sup> at 20 ºC, by means of two transfer standards of excellent metrological characteristics.</p>
