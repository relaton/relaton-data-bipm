    <p>The results of the SIM.M.D-S2 bilateral comparison between INRIM–Italy and INMETRO–Brazil are summarized in this report. The aims of this comparison were to check the stated uncertainty levels and the degrees of equivalence between the two institutes on the calibration of hydrometers for liquid density in the range of 800 kg m<sup>−3</sup> to 1000 kg m<sup>−3</sup> at 20 ºC, by means of two transfer standards of excellent metrological characteristics.</p><p>Main text.

    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by SIM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
