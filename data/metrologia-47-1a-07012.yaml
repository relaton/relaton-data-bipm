    <p>Key comparison APMP.M.FF-K3 has been undertaken by the APMP Technical Committee for Fluid Flow, and was piloted by the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ, AIST). The objective was to demonstrate the degrees of equivalence of the air speed standards, held at the participating laboratories, relative to the CCM.FF-K3 key comparison reference value and to provide supporting evidence for the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) claimed by the participating laboratories in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>A selected transfer standard was circulated among the six participants in eleven months starting February 2009. The repeated calibration results at NMIJ demonstrated sufficient reproducibility of the transfer standard. At 2 m/s and 20 m/s, a linkage to the global key comparison (CCM.FF-K3) was established by applying corrections to the participant results based on the results from the linking laboratories, thus making it possible to extend the relevant graphs of equivalence.</p><p>Main text.

    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
