    <p>This comparison is a subsequent key comparison to the comparison CCM.M-K3 performed in 2001–2002 and published in 2005. This comparison is between the CEM (Spain) as participating laboratory and the LNE (France) as pilot laboratory. The aim of this comparison was to compare the results obtained by each laboratory when calibrating the same two 50 kg stainless steel mass standards, one provided by CEM and one by LNE.</p><p>Main text.
