    <p>Measurements of the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) in ambient air have become an important item in the regulation of ambient air quality. In general, NO<sub>2</sub> analyzers based on chemiluminescence detection are calibrated using an NO mixture in a balance of nitrogen. A key comparison for high concentration of NO in nitrogen, CCQM-K1.c, was conducted from 1995 to 1996. Recently, a key comparison for low concentration of NO in nitrogen, CCQM-K26.a, was conducted from 2004 to 2006. This APMP.QM-K1.c key comparison was intended to be a re-run of CCQM-K1.c in the APMP region, and the nominal amount fraction of the gas mixture was ~100 Âµmol/mol.</p><p>The results of this key comparison show that the estimated uncertainties are larger than the deviations from the reference value. Consequently, the results from NIM and KRISS are in agreement.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
