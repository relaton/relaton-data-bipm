    <p>The CCQM-K34.2 key comparison was organized as a subsequent key comparison to  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/08008">CCQM-K34: Assay of Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate</ext-link> to demonstrate the new and improved capability of INMETRO and UNIIM to measure the amount content of acid in potassium hydrogen phthalate. The key comparisons and the previous pilot study CCQM-P36 were organized jointly by the working groups of inorganic analysis and electrochemistry analysis. All participants used high-accuracy constant current coulometry for measurement. The agreement of the results was very good. Slovak Institute of Metrology acted as the coordinating laboratory and served as a link to the reference value of CCQM-K34.</p>
