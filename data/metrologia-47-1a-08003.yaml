abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The CCQM-K34.2 key comparison was organized as a subsequent key comparison to CCQM-K34: Assay of Potassium Hydrogen Phthalate to demonstrate the new and improved capability of INMETRO and UNIIM to measure the amount content of acid in potassium hydrogen phthalate. The key comparisons and the previous pilot study CCQM-P36 were organized jointly by the working groups of inorganic analysis and electrochemistry analysis. All participants used high-accuracy constant current coulometry for measurement. The agreement of the results was very good. Slovak Institute of Metrology acted as the coordinating laboratory and served as a link to the reference value of CCQM-K34.</p><p>Main text.
