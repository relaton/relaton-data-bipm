abstract:
- content: "<p>The key comparison CCQM-K65 was intended to compare the capabilities
    for the preparation and value assignment of gas standards for methyl and ethyl
    mercaptans in methane, maintained at the participating national metrological institutes:
    VNIIM (Russia), KRISS (Korea), VSL (Netherlands) and NPL (United Kingdom). The
    range of the nominal amount of substance fractions of the comparison gas mixtures
    was 20 µmol/mol to 30 µmol/mol, which is close to regulatory level (in several
    countries including Russia) for mercaptans in odorated natural gas. This comparison
    was proposed at the 12th GAWG meeting in October 2004 and was conducted in 2008.</p><p>Conclusions
    are as follows:<p>The results of all laboratories are consistent with the reference
    values.</p><p>The observed differences between the reference and reported values
    are within ±0.9% for methyl mercaptan and ±0.75% for ethyl mercaptan relative
    to the gravimetric values, and do not exceed the appropriate assigned expanded
    uncertainties.</p><p>The prepared mixtures were found to be stable during about
    a year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p><p>The gravimetric values
    were successfully validated with a dynamic method.</p></p><p> Main text. \nTo

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
