    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K65 was intended to compare the capabilities for the preparation and value assignment of gas standards for methyl and ethyl mercaptans in methane, maintained at the participating national metrological institutes: VNIIM (Russia), KRISS (Korea), VSL (Netherlands) and NPL (United Kingdom). The range of the nominal amount of substance fractions of the comparison gas mixtures was 20 µmol/mol to 30 µmol/mol, which is close to regulatory level (in several countries including Russia) for mercaptans in odorated natural gas. This comparison was proposed at the 12th GAWG meeting in October 2004 and was conducted in 2008.</p>
    <p>Conclusions are as follows:
     <list list-type="unordered">
     <list-item><p>The results of all laboratories are consistent with the reference values.</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>The observed differences between the reference and reported values are within ±0.9% for methyl mercaptan and ±0.75% for ethyl mercaptan relative to the gravimetric values, and do not exceed the appropriate assigned expanded uncertainties.</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>The prepared mixtures were found to be stable during about a year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>The gravimetric values were successfully validated with a dynamic method.</p></list-item>
    </list></p>
