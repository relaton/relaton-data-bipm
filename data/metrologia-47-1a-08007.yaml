    <p>The CCQM-K56 key comparison was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of CCQM as a follow-up to completed pilot study CCQM-P64 to test the abilities of national metrology institutes to measure the amount content of nutritious elements in whole fat soybean powder. A pilot study CCQM-P64.1 was conducted in parallel with this key comparison. The National Institute of Metrology (NIM), P. R. China, acted as the coordinating laboratory.</p>
    <p>Eleven NIMs participated in CCQM-K56. Four elements – Ca, Fe, Zn and Cu – in different concentration levels have been studied. Different measurement methods (IDMS, ICP-MS, ICP-OES, AAS and INAA) and the microwave digestion method were used.</p>
    <p>The agreement of the results of CCQM-K56 is very good, and obviously better than that of the original P64. It shows that the capability of all of the participants had been promoted from the original pilot study to this key comparison.</p>
