    back to 1992 (CCQM-K1a). It was one of the first types of gas mixtures that were
    used in an international key comparison. Since then, numerous national metrology
    institutes (NMIs) have been setting up facilities for gas analysis, and have developed
    claims for their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) for these mixtures.
    Furthermore, in the April 2005 meeting of the CCQM (Consultative Committee for
    Amount of Substance) Gas Analysis Working Group, a policy was proposed to repeat
    key comparisons for stable mixtures every 10 years. This comparison was performed
    in line with the policy proposal and provided an opportunity for NMIs that could
    not participate in the previous comparison. NMISA from South Africa acted as the
    pilot laboratory.</p><p>Of the 25 participating laboratories, 19 (76%) showed
    satisfactory degrees of equivalence to the gravimetric reference value. The results
    show that the CO concentration is not influenced by the measurement method used,
    and from this it may be concluded that the pure CO, used to prepare the gas mixtures,
    was not<sup>13</sup>C-isotope depleted. This was confirmed by the isotope ratio
    analysis carried out by KRISS on a 1% mixture of CO in nitrogen, obtained from
    the NMISA.</p><p>There is no indication of positive or negative bias in the gravimetric
    reference value, as the results from the different laboratories are evenly distributed
    on both sides of the key comparison reference value.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
