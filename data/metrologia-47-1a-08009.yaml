    <p>The CCQM-K48 key comparison for determination of the purity of potassium chloride was organized jointly by the inorganic analysis and electrochemical analysis working groups of CCQM to test the abilities of the metrology institutes to measure the amount content of chloride in KCl.  National Institute of Metrology P.R.China (NIM) acted as the coordinating laboratory of this comparison with SMU and NIST as co-coordinating laboratories. Seven NMIs participated in this key comparison. All participants used coulometry (except NMIJ which used gravimetry) and all of them analyzed the impurity bromine in the sample and made corrections. In general very good agreement of the results was observed. Some possible problems were highlighted.</p>
