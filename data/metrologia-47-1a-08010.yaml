    <p>Key comparison COOMET.QM-K1.a is the second key comparison in the field of gas analysis organized by the Technical Committee 1.8 'Physical Chemistry' of COOMET, and corresponds to measurements of carbon monoxide in nitrogen for nominal amount-of-substance fractions of 100 µmol/mol and 1000 µmol/mol. COOMET.QM-K1.a results could be linked to those of an earlier key comparison, CCQM-K1.a, carried out by the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance, and published in 1999.</p><p>The aims of this COOMET exercise were the recognition of national measurement standards of Belarus and Ukraine in view of entering calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of BelGIM and Ukrmetrteststandard in the KCDB of the BIPM in accordance with the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) for national measurement standards and for calibration and measurement certificates issued by NMIs; and to improve the CMCs of those laboratories which previously participated in the key comparison CCQM-K1a: BAM and VNIIM.</p><p>All the laboratory results stand within ±0.6% relative to the gravimetric value obtained by the coordinating laboratory for the nominal value 100 µmol/mol, and within ±0.3% relative to the gravimetric value for the nominal value 1000 µmol/mol. This represents a satisfying output.</p><p>For all the laboratories the observed difference between the gravimetric and reported values does not exceed its combined uncertainty.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
