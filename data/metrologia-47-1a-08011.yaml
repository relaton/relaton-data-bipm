    <p>The Key Comparison K67 and the parallel Pilot Study P108 on quantitative analysis of thin alloy films have been completed in the Surface Analysis Working Group (SAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM). The aim of these inter-laboratory comparisons is to determine the degree of equivalence in the measurement capability of national metrology institutes (NMIs) and designated institutes (DIs) for the determination of the composition of thin alloy films. The measurand is expressed in atomic percent. A Fe–Ni alloy film with a certified composition was available for the participants of the inter-laboratory comparison. It has been used as a reference specimen to determine the relative sensitivity factors (RSF) of Fe and Ni for the different analytical methods used by the participants to determine the composition of the test sample. As was shown in the preceding Pilot Study P98, the degrees of equivalence in the measurement capabilities of the participants can be improved in that way. The composition of the reference specimen was certified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using the isotope dilution method. The in-depth and lateral homogeneity, determined in terms of elemental composition, of the certified reference sample and the unknown test sample were confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) using C<sub>60</sub> primary ions by the leading laboratory. Five laboratories participated in the key comparison. Four of them used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and one Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). One laboratory participated in the parallel P108 pilot study using electron probe micro analysis with an energy-dispersive spectrometer (ED EPMA) and XPS.</p>
