- content: |-
    <p>The aim of this comparison is to evaluate the gravimetry and purity verification of gas mixtures prepared by introducing a liquid into a gas cylinder. This type of preparation is well known from, e.g., ethanol in nitrogen/air (CCQM-K4), and n-hexane in synthetic natural gas (CCQM-K16). The choice for n-hexane in methane is based on the relevance of natural gas primary standard mixtures and higher hydrocarbons in synthetic natural gas (for, e.g., dew point calibrations). Furthermore, n-hexane is relatively straightforward to analyse using a GC/FID (gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionisation detector) with good repeatability.</p><p>Eight laboratories participated. After the data evaluation, the result of one laboratory was eliminated to arrive at a consistent subset. The quality of the fitted line was not overly good, leading to small discrepancies in the degrees-of-equivalence calculated for three other laboratories. Only four laboratories are consistent with the KCRV.</p><p>Main text.
