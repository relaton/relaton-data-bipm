    <p>The composition of natural gas is one of the significant objects for comparison study. Since 2000 three key comparisons of natural gas within CCQM have been implemented: CCQM-K1e-g, CCQM-K16a-b and CCQM-K23a-c.</p><p>In 2007 VNIIM offered to organize within COOMET a key comparison of natural gas linked to CCQM-K23b. There were five NMIs that decided to take part in COOMET.QM-K23b in order to claim new or improve present CMCs: Ukrmetrteststandard (Ukraine), BelGIM (Belarus), BAM (Germany), SMU (Slovak Republic) and CMI (Czech Republic). Most of the NMIs (VNIIM, BAM, SMU, CMI) participated in CCQM-K23b; BelGIM and Ukrmetrteststandard participated in a comparison of natural gas for the first time.</p><p>The gas mixtures for study contained nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ethane, propane, iso-butane, n-butane and methane. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) was based on the gravimetric preparation for all components.</p><p>In order to determine the link between COOMET.QM-K23b and CCQM-K23b the uncertainty of degrees of equivalence of all the participants included the degree of equivalence of VNIIM in CCQM-K23b.</p><p>The agreement of the results in this key comparison is very good. Most of the results agree with the KCRV within 0.5% relative. BelGIM and Ukrmetrteststandard participated in a comparison of natural gas for the first time, and both laboratories performed well in this key comparison. CMI obtained better results than in CCQM-K23b.</p><p>Main text.
