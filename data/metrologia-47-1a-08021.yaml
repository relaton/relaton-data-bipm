    <p>Industrial stack gas emission measurements are important for process control, control of air pollution, and for implementing legislation regarding carbon dioxide emission rights. Measurements are typically performed using a range of process analysers for carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and miscellaneous hydrocarbons. The calibration of these analysers is often performed using a series of binary mixtures of each component in nitrogen. For reasons of efficiency as well as a better match with true stack gas, the use of multi-component mixtures for this purpose would be preferred.</p>
    <p>The aim of this key comparison is to evaluate the measurement capabilities of national metrology institutes for carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, sulphur dioxide and propane in nitrogen. Ten laboratories participated in the key comparison and one in the associated study. The key comparison reference value is based on the gravimetric preparation data.</p>
