    <p>Ammonia is an important compound in the chemical industry. It is widely used and is the basis for producing other compounds containing nitrogen. Ammonia is also very hazardous, and consequently emissions of ammonia need be controlled and monitored. In the past years, several national metrology institutes have developed facilities for the preparation of Primary Standard gas Mixtures (PSMs), dynamically generated ammonia mixtures and facilities for comparing and certifying gas mixtures containing ammonia.</p>
    <p>The amount-of-substance fraction level of ammonia chosen for this key comparison is 30–50 µmol/mol. The results of this key comparison revealed that there is at present no consensus among static and dynamic techniques for gas mixture preparation for this component in this range.  As key comparison reference value (KCRV), the mean of the three methods is used. In its uncertainty, no allowance is made for the observed biases. With respect to the KCRV, only two laboratories report consistent results. When grouped in accordance with the employed methods, the results are consistent. Further experimental work is needed.</p>
