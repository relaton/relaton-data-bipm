    <p>This report of the EUROMET.AUV.V-K1.1 comparison presents the final results of the second, follow-up EUROMET comparison in the area of vibration, in this case defined as sinusoidal acceleration. The relation between the results of the participants in this RMO comparison and the results of the first CIPM comparison in the field of vibration CCAUV.V-K1 is calculated via a procedure using one linking laboratory and is fully described. Using this linking, the results of the participants can be directly compared with the results of other comparisons, whether the CCAUV.V-K1 itself or others that are also linked such as the EUROMET.AUV.V-K1. The full uncertainty budgets are given in Appendix A and the Technical Protocol that was used is included as Appendix B.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
