    <p>This report of the EUROMET.AUV.V-K1.1 comparison presents the final results of the second, follow-up EUROMET comparison in the area of vibration, in this case defined as sinusoidal acceleration. The relation between the results of the participants in this RMO comparison and the results of the first CIPM comparison in the field of vibration  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/40/1A/09001">CCAUV.V-K1</ext-link> is calculated via a procedure using one linking laboratory and is fully described. Using this linking, the results of the participants can be directly compared with the results of other comparisons, whether the CCAUV.V-K1 itself or others that are also linked such as the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0026-1394/43/1A/09002">EUROMET.AUV.V-K1</ext-link>. The full uncertainty budgets are given in Appendix A and the Technical Protocol that was used is included as Appendix B.</p>
