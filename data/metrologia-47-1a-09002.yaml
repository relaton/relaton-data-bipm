abstract:
- content: "<p>This report of the CCAUV.V-K1.1 key comparison (KC) presents the final
    results of the second, follow-up CIPM comparison in the area of vibration, in
    this case defined as sinusoidal acceleration. The relation between the results
    of the participants in this follow-up comparison and the results of the first
    CIPM comparison in the field of vibration   CCAUV.V-K1  is calculated via a procedure
    using one linking laboratory and is fully described. Using this linking, the results
    of the participants can be directly compared with the results of other comparisons
    like CCAUV.V-K1.</p><p>Supplementing the scope of the original CIPM comparison,
    the frequency range of the reported KC was extended up to 10 kHz and the measurand
    phase was included for some of the participants.</p><p>The Technical Protocol
    that was used is included as Appendix A and the full uncertainty budgets are given
    in Appendix B.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click
    on   Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of
    the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
