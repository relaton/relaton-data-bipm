    <p>This report of the CCAUV.V-K1.1 key comparison (KC) presents the final results of the second, follow-up CIPM comparison in the area of vibration, in this case defined as sinusoidal acceleration. The relation between the results of the participants in this follow-up comparison and the results of the first CIPM comparison in the field of vibration  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/40/1A/09001">CCAUV.V-K1</ext-link> is calculated via a procedure using one linking laboratory and is fully described. Using this linking, the results of the participants can be directly compared with the results of other comparisons like CCAUV.V-K1.</p>
    <p>Supplementing the scope of the original CIPM comparison, the frequency range of the reported KC was extended up to 10 kHz and the measurand phase was included for some of the participants.</p>
    <p>The Technical Protocol that was used is included as Appendix A and the full uncertainty budgets are given in Appendix B.</p>
