    <p>The Key Comparison CCAUV.A-K4 has been carried out under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The participating NMIs are the Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Normalizacao e Qualidade Industrial (INMETRO, Brazil), the Centro Nacional de Metrología (CENAM, Mexico), the Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais (LNE, France), the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ, Japan), the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, Korea) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Germany). The role of the Pilot laboratory was undertaken by the DFM and CENAM. The measurements took place between January 2007 and February 2008. The time schedule was organized in a single star configuration. Two LS2aP microphones were circulated. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of the degrees of equivalence.</p><p>Main text.
