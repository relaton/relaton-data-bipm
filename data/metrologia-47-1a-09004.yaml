- content: |-
    <p>A third comparison of vibration acceleration APMP.AUV.V-K1.2 has been made within the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) to include two national laboratories, the KIM-LIPI (Indonesia) and the NPLI (India). The pilot laboratory was the NIM (China) that was also used to link the results to the CCAUV.V-K1 comparison. The accelerations varied from 10 m s<sup>−2</sup> to 200 m s<sup>−2</sup> over the frequency range from 40 Hz to 5 kHz. The results demonstrate the agreement with the key comparison reference value and each other, within the expanded uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.
