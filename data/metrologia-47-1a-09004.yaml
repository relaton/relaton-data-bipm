    <p>A third comparison of vibration acceleration APMP.AUV.V-K1.2 has been made within the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) to include two national laboratories, the KIM-LIPI (Indonesia) and the NPLI (India). The pilot laboratory was the NIM (China) that was also used to link the results to the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/40/1A/09001">CCAUV.V-K1</ext-link> comparison. The accelerations varied from 10 m s<sup>−2</sup> to 200 m s<sup>−2</sup> over the frequency range from 40 Hz to 5 kHz. The results demonstrate the agreement with the key comparison reference value and each other, within the expanded uncertainties.</p>
