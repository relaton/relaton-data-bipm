abstract:
- content: "<p>It seems that so much of modern life is defined by the materials we
    use. From aircraft to architecture, from cars to communications, from microelectronics
    to medicine, the development of new materials and the innovative application of
    existing ones have underpinned the technological advances that have transformed
    the way we live, work and play.</p><p>Recognizing the need for a sound technical
    basis for drafting codes of practice and specifications for advanced materials,
    the governments of countries of the Economic Summit (G7) and the European Commission
    signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 1982 to establish the Versailles Project
    on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS). This project supports international
    trade by enabling scientific collaboration as a precursor to the drafting of standards.
    The VAMAS participants recognized the importance of agreeing a reliable, universally
    accepted basis for the traceability of the measurements on which standards depend
    for their preparation and implementation.</p><p>Seeing the need to involve the
    wider metrology community, VAMAS approached the Comité International des Poids
    et Mesures (CIPM). Following discussions with NMI Directors and a workshop at
    the BIPM in February 2005, the CIPM decided to establish an ad hoc Working Group
    on the metrology applicable to the measurement of material properties. The Working
    Group presented its conclusions to the CIPM in October 2007 and published its
    final report in 2008, leading to the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding
    between VAMAS and the BIPM. This MoU recognizes the work that is already going
    on in VAMAS as well as in the Consultative Committees of the CIPM and establishes
    a framework for an ongoing dialogue on issues of materials metrology.</p><p>The
    question of what is meant by traceability in the metrology of the properties of
    materials is particularly vexed when the measurement results depend on a specified
    procedure. In these cases, confidence in results requires not only traceable calibration
    of the various instruments and standards used but also the reliable application
    of an accepted measurement procedure. Nowhere is this more evident than in the
    use of hardness scales, which are not directly traceable to the SI.</p><p>This
    special issue of Metrologia includes a summary of the findings and conclusions
    of the Working Group and a further 14 papers covering the full range of properties
    of interest in science, engineering and standards making. It includes papers by
    authors at eight national measurement institutes and four other research centres.
    In addition to mechanical properties, there are papers addressing issues associated
    with the measurement of electromagnetic, acoustic and optical properties as well
    as those arising from the specific structural features of many new materials.</p><p>As
    guest editors, we are extremely grateful to all the authors who have contributed
    to this special issue on the measurement of the properties of materials. We hope
    it will contribute to a wider appreciation of many of the associated issues and
    foster a growing understanding of the importance of ensuring that all such measurements
    are performed in accordance with accepted standards and procedures, with proper
    attention to the need to establish the traceability of the results. Only in this
    way can the performance, safety and fitness for purpose of products be guaranteed.</p>"
