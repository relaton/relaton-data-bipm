abstract:
- content: "<p>Elastic modulus is an intrinsic material property and a key parameter
    in engineering design and materials development. A wide range of test methods
    is available for measuring modulus, but there is currently some uncertainty within
    parts of the user community about the reliability of modulus data, particularly
    from the tensile test, to the extent that many use standard handbook values in
    their calculations and designs. This is not recommended and can be addressed through
    good experimental practice and careful measurement.</p><p>The paper discusses
    some of the key practical issues associated with the tensile test that need to
    be considered to obtain reliable values for Young's modulus such as strain measurement,
    alignment, data analysis methods, software validation, uncertainty budgets and
    the use of reference materials.</p>"
