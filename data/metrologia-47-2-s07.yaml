abstract:
- content: "<p>The measurement of hardness has been and continues to be of significant
    importance to many of the world's manufacturing industries. Conventional hardness
    testing is the most commonly used method for acceptance testing and production
    quality control of metals and metallic products. Instrumented indentation is one
    of the few techniques available for obtaining various property values for coatings
    and electronic products in the micrometre and nanometre dimensional scales. For
    these industries to be successful, it is critical that measurements made by suppliers
    and customers agree within some practical limits.</p><p>To help assure this measurement
    agreement, a traceability chain for hardness measurement traceability from the
    hardness definition to industry has developed and evolved over the past 100 years,
    but its development has been complicated. A hardness measurement value not only
    requires traceability of force, length and time measurements but also requires
    traceability of the hardness values measured by the hardness machine. These multiple
    traceability paths are needed because a hardness measurement is affected by other
    influence parameters that are often difficult to identify, quantify and correct.
    This paper describes the current situation of hardness measurement traceability
    that exists for the conventional hardness methods (i.e. Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers
    and Knoop hardness) and for special-application hardness and indentation methods
    (i.e. elastomer, dynamic, portables and instrumented indentation).</p>"
