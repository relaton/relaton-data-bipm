abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last few years, the need for wider international collaboration
    in the measurement of materials properties has been under discussion between the
    Versailles Project on Advanced Materials and Standards (VAMAS) and the Comité
    International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) with a view to including materials metrology
    in the formal international measurement structure established under the Metre
    Convention. Following a workshop at the BIPM in February 2005 the CIPM established
    an ad hoc Working Group on the metrology applicable to the measurement of material
    properties. The Working Group assessed a wide range of properties and explored
    the role of reference materials in ensuring confidence in measurement data. It
    also identified a number of different classes of materials that would merit consideration
    and a wide range of properties that are routinely measured.</p><p>The Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA) drawn up in 1999 by the CIPM seeks to provide ‘a secure technical
    foundation for wider agreement for measurements related to international trade,
    commerce and regulatory affairs’ and some materials properties are already the
    subject of study by the CIPM's Consultative Committees.</p><p>The Working Group
    has made a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring an ongoing dialogue between
    VAMAS and the CIPM. As well as proposing joint activities, underpinned by a Cooperation
    Agreement which would require VAMAS to report annually to the CIPM on needs for
    improved materials metrology, there are recommendations which will extend the
    work of the CIPM's Consultative Committees to ensure that Calibration and Measurement
    Capabilities (CMCs) for a number of important materials properties are included
    in the Key Comparison Database in due course.</p>"
