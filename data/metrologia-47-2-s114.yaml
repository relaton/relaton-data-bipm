  content: "<p>Major methods to measure the magnetic properties of materials are systematically
    discussed in the light of the general phenomenology of magnetism in matter and
    its physical interpretation. Attention is paid to the problems of measurement
    traceability and reproducibility and the related standards. While the discussion
    is focused on the characterization of the soft and hard ferromagnetic materials
    relevant for electromagnetic applications, brief consideration is given to the
    special problems posed by measurements on feebly magnetic materials. It is stressed
    how geometrical and physical properties can often combine to make the determination
    of the true magnetic properties of materials a somewhat elusive goal. Measurement
    reproducibility can nevertheless be attained under the guidance provided by written
    standards. Recent evolution of the magnetic measuring techniques has occurred
    in response to the digital revolution and the development of novel high-performance
    materials (e.g. extra-hard rare-earth based magnets, multilayers, micro/nanostructures,
    etc). It is stressed, however, that the drive to progress in measurements ultimately
    stems from the search for new fundamental phenomena in materials and their understanding.</p>"
