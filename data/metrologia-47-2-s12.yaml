abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to improve the performance of devices, components and systems,
    where heat is generated, transported, stored or converted to other types of energy,
    reliable thermal design and simulation are required using reliable thermophysical
    property data. In order to produce reliable thermophysical property data systematically
    and continually, the international and national standards of thermophysical properties
    must be established and the measurement methods should be evaluated and standardized,
    and the measuring instruments must be calibrated by reference materials traceable
    to the international or national standard.</p><p>Users search for and purchase
    a particular grade of material which satisfies the properties, performances and
    technical specifications required. In order to guarantee fair commerce and trade,
    values of thermophysical properties should be measured traceable to the national
    standard. Thus, the establishment of an international standard is required satisfying
    the global CIPM MRA under the metric convention, and then, the global and regional
    framework to examine calibration and measurement capability of national metrology
    institutes (NMIs). A domestic traceability system in each country should be established
    and the quality management system of the NMI and calibration laboratories should
    be constructed based on ISO 17025.</p>"
