  content: "<p>A review is presented of methods of measurement for a range of key
    acoustic properties of materials, spanning three application areas: airborne sound,
    underwater acoustics and ultrasound. The acoustic properties considered, primarily
    transmission loss (damping) and echo-reduction, are specifically important to
    the end application of any material. The state-of-the-art in measurement and likely
    future challenges are described in detail.</p>"
