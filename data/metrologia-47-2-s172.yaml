  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The instrumentation of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
    for the measurement of the directional spectral emissivity in air in the temperature
    range from 80 °C to 400 °C and wavelength range from 4 µm to 40 µm and the subsequent
    procedures for data evaluation are described. Special emphasis is placed on the
    calculation of the uncertainty of the directional spectral emissivity and of the
    uncertainty of the sample surface temperature. For samples with typical emissivities
    of about 0.6, absolute expanded uncertainties (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of 0.01
    can be reached at a surface temperature of 200 °C in the spectral range from 5 µm
    to 40 µm. However, it is also shown that—due to the complex dependence of the
    uncertainty on the sample and the conditions of measurement—general statements
    about the uncertainty cannot be given. The uncertainty of the emissivity has to
    be calculated for each individual case of sample and temperature.</p>"
