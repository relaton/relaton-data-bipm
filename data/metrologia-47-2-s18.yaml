  content: "<p>A schematic traceability chain is proposed similar to the traceability
    scheme in chemical measurements, in which calibration hierarchy is established
    by consecutive sets of three components, namely measurement standard, measurement
    system and measurement procedure. The calibration hierarchy is established among
    sets of measurement levels, which are characterized by the associated uncertainty
    that is assigned or achieved to the value assignment process or calibration provided.
    By taking particle size measurements as an example, a scheme of the implementation
    of traceability is explained in which proper establishment of three respective
    elements are illustrated: method or procedure, measurement system and standard
    or reference material.</p>"
