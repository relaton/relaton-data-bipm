  content: "<p>This paper reviews the basic concepts, metrological requirements and
    approaches for the precise and accurate measurement of photoluminescent materials.
    These fluorescence measurements offer significant advantages in terms of sensitivity
    and selectivity, finding wide use in a range of applications in bioanalytical,
    analytical chemistry and colour technology. Depending upon the specific metrological
    requirement, different properties of the photoluminescent material are of interest
    and different measurement techniques and instrumentation have been developed.
    The optical properties of interest for both analytical and colorimetric applications
    are defined along with their basic measurement principles. However, many problems
    are associated with the comparability of these measurements due to their dependence
    on both instrument and sample parameters. These considerations and measurement
    problems are identified and the impacts of standardization methods are illustrated
    in two typical applications. The paper also gives a detailed description of both
    the physical transfer standard and chemical transfer standard approaches for obtaining
    reliable, traceable fluorescence data. However, for many applications, the robust
    standardization of these measurements and availability of appropriate transfer
    standards are still in their infancy. This paper concludes with a brief discussion
    of the state-of-the-art uncertainties in the metrology of photoluminescence.</p>"
