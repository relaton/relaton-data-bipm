  content: "<p>Global comparability of the measured values of material properties
    is based on some fundamental metrological concepts. These concepts are either
    already widely implemented in current procedures for materials testing or they
    are being further developed and increasingly accepted and used. An important aspect
    of the comparability of measurement results is metrological traceability. This
    paper aims at illustrating with practical examples how to apply the concept of
    metrological traceability as defined in ISO/IEC Guide 99:2007, known also as the
    VIM (International Vocabulary of Metrology), in the field of engineering material
    properties. VIM distinguishes three different types of references for traceability:
    either to a system of units, such as the SI, to a measurement procedure or to
    a physical measurement standard. For each approach, an example is given in the
    field of engineering material properties, including appropriate traceability statements
    and means to achieve the traceability. The role of certified reference materials
    is highlighted, as well as practical consequences of traceability requirements
    for the design of reference material certification projects.</p>"
