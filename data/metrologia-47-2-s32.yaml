  content: "<p>Many important mechanical properties of materials including tensile
    strength are procedure dependent. This means that test results are traceable to
    standard test procedures rather than SI base units. However, most of the test
    procedures described in the current international standards such as ISO and ASTM
    are not suitable to be adopted as a primary standard procedure since they were
    developed to be used at industrial sites as well as testing laboratories. The
    Working Group on Hardness under CCM is working to develop a primary standard procedure
    to establish traceability for hardness measurement through key comparison among
    NMIs. These kinds of activities are necessary for other properties such as tensile
    strength, impact strength, creep and fatigue for the establishment of a traceability
    system. KRISS has been trying to establish a traceability chain in the measurement
    of materials' mechanical properties through international round-robin tests, the
    development of certified reference materials and uncertainty evaluation. In this
    paper, the activities of KRISS for establishing traceability and those of related
    ISO technical committees are described.</p>"
