    <p>Elastic modulus is an intrinsic material property and a key parameter in engineering design and materials development. A wide range of test methods is available for measuring modulus, but there is currently some uncertainty within parts of the user community about the reliability of modulus data, particularly from the tensile test, to the extent that many use standard handbook values in their calculations and designs. This is not recommended and can be addressed through good experimental practice and careful measurement.</p>
    <p>The paper discusses some of the key practical issues associated with the tensile test that need to be considered to obtain reliable values for Young's modulus such as strain measurement, alignment, data analysis methods, software validation, uncertainty budgets and the use of reference materials.</p>
