  content: "<p>With the emergence of international standards for the instrumented
    indentation test, an international comparison on nanoindentation, sponsored by
    The International Academy for Production Engineering (CIRP), was performed. The
    objective of the comparison was to determine how well the ISO standards adopted
    in October 2002 (ISO 14577-1, -2, -3) could be realized. The exercise involved
    12 participants throughout Europe, Asia and the USA. Results for hardness and
    elastic modulus of (1 0 0)Al were collected and analysed. A comparison of the
    results obtained by this exercise with those obtained from the first CIRP international
    comparison on ultra-microhardness and elasticity measurement held from 1993 to
    1997 was made.</p>"
