abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurement of microstructural parameters is essential for both controlling
    and modelling properties of and production processes for advanced materials. In
    the past decade new techniques such as electron backscatter diffraction have enabled
    a considerable increase in the amount of data and degree of detail in microstructural
    measurements of, for example, the extent of recrystallization in a metal deformed
    at high temperatures. However, the many parameters involved and automated nature
    of the methods can lead to artefacts and bias in calculated values, and increased
    resolution will lead to disagreement with more conventional methods. Examples
    are given of the range of microstructural measurements possible by new techniques
    and how different results can be obtained from the same underlying data. The need
    is stressed for interlaboratory comparisons to enable underpinning data to be
    derived on the validity, repeatability and reproducibility of measurements of
    key microstructural parameters.</p>"
