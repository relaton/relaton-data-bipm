  content: "<p>The current status and future needs of nanoparticle metrology are discussed,
    particularly with respect to measurements of size, size distribution and number
    concentration of airborne and liquid-borne nanoparticles. Possible classification
    of types of measurement standards is proposed, and the role of each type of standard,
    including the feasibility of its establishment, is examined. A desirable interplay
    between measurement standards and documentary standards in establishing the traceability
    chain in particle measurements is suggested. Particle-related calibration services
    currently provided by our laboratory at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial
    Science and Technology are also described.</p>"
