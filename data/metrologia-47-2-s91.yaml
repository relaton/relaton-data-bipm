  content: "<p>This review gives a brief introduction to the principles of microwave
    measurements of the complex permittivity of materials. The fundamentals of reflection,
    transmission and resonant methods are summarized and examples of sample cell design
    and measurement systems are presented for each category. The frequency domain
    and the fast response time domain methods are discussed in view of their merits
    and limitations. Accuracy aspects and reference materials for calibration procedures
    are mentioned briefly. Selected examples of applications indicate the diverse
    usability spectrum of microwave dielectric measurements in basic research and
    in the characterization of materials in manufacturing processes as well as monitoring
    and control routines.</p>"
