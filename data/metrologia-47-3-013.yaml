abstract:
- content: "<p>An indirect determination of the thermodynamic temperature of the fixed
    point of copper was made at INRIM by measuring four cells with a Si-based and
    an InGaAs-based precision radiation thermometer carrying approximated thermodynamic
    scales realized up to the Ag point. An average value T<sub>Cu</sub> = 1357.840 K
    was found with a standard uncertainty of 0.047 K. A consequent (T − T<sub>90</sub>)<sub>Cu</sub>
    value of 70 mK can be derived which is 18 mK higher than, but consistent with,
    the presently available (T − T<sub>90</sub>)<sub>Cu</sub> as elaborated by the
    CCT-WG4.</p>"
