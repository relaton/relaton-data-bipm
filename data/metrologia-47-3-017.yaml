abstract:
- content: "<p>Applying the Monte Carlo method for propagation of measurement uncertainty
    described in the Supplement 1 to the  Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
    Measurement  (GUM), when the input quantities are correlated, involves the specification
    of a joint probability distribution for these quantities. This applies equally
    whether the output quantity is a scalar or a vector.</p><p>In practice, however,
    all that typically is available are probability distributions for the individual
    input quantities (their  marginal  distributions) and estimates of the correlations
    between them. Even though there are infinitely many joint distributions that are
    consistent with given marginal distributions and correlations, a method is needed
    to manufacture a particular one that may reasonably be used in practice. This
    paper explains how  copulas  may be used to this effect, illustrates their use
    in examples, including example H.2 from the GUM, discusses the choice of copula
    and provides an algorithm to delineate minimum volume coverage regions for vectorial
    measurands.</p>"
