abstract:
- content: "<p>Current recommendations for evaluating uncertainty of measurement are
    based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability distributions as encoding
    the state of knowledge about the quantities to which those distributions refer.
    Given a measurement model that relates an output quantity to one or more input
    quantities, the distribution of the former is obtained by propagating those of
    the latter according to the axioms of probability calculus and also, if measurement
    data are available, by applying Bayes' theorem.</p><p>The main objective of this
    paper is to show that alternative ways of applying Bayes' theorem are possible,
    and that these alternative formulations yield the same results provided consistent
    use is made of measurement data and prior information. In this context the necessity
    of assigning non-informative priors arises often. Therefore, the second concern
    of the paper is to point out, by means of a specific example, that the seemingly
    reasonable choice of a uniform prior for a quantity about which no information
    is available may not conform to the accepted rules for constructing non-informative
    priors.</p>"
