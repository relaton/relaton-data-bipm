  content: "<p>We propose a novel procedure for the analysis of key comparison data.
    The goal of the procedure is to detect biases in the reported measurement results
    which are not accounted for by quoted uncertainties. A fixed effects bias model
    is employed which constrains the biases of some of the laboratories to zero. Only
    the <italic>number</italic> of these laboratories needs to be specified, not the
    laboratories themselves. The analysis then runs through all possible different
    models, each assuming zero biases for a different <italic>subset</italic> of laboratories.
    The results from these models are finally merged by employing a Bayesian model
    averaging technique. Explicit formulae are derived which allow for an easy application
    of the proposed approach. The procedure is illustrated by its application to data
    from the CCL-K1 key comparison.</p>"
