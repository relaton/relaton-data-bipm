  content: "<p>Metrologists often represent the state of knowledge concerning a quantity
    about which scant specific information is available by a rectangular probability
    distribution. The end points are frequently specified by subjective judgment;
    therefore, they are inexactly known. If the states of knowledge about the end
    points may be represented by other (narrower) rectangular distributions, then
    the resulting probability distribution looks like a trapezoid whose sloping sides
    are curved. We refer to such a probability distribution as curvilinear trapezoid.
    Depending on the limits of rectangular distributions for the end points, the curvilinear
    trapezoidal distribution may be asymmetric. In a previous paper we had shown that
    if the mid-point of a rectangular distribution is known and the state of knowledge
    about the half-width may be represented by a rectangular distribution then the
    resulting distribution is symmetric curvilinear trapezoid. In this paper, we describe
    the probability density function of a curvilinear trapezoidal distribution which
    arises from inexactly known end points. Then we give compact analytic expressions
    for all moments including the expected value and the variance. Next we discuss
    how random numbers from such a distribution may be generated. We compare the curvilinear
    trapezoid which arises from inexactly known end points with the corresponding
    trapezoid whose sloping sides are straight. We also compare the curvilinear trapezoid
    which arises from inexactly known end points with the curvilinear trapezoid which
    arises when the mid-point is known and the state of knowledge about the half-width
    may be represented by a rectangular distribution. The results presented in this
    paper are useful in evaluating uncertainty according to the <italic>Guide to the
    Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (GUM) as well as Supplement
    1 to the GUM (GUM-S1).</p>"
