abstract:
- content: "<p>The recent third edition of the International Vocabulary of Metrology—Basic
    and General Concepts and Associated Terms (VIM3) (JCGM 200:2008 (Sèvres: BIPM);
    also ISO/IEC Guide 99:2007 3rd edn (Geneva: ISO)) has undergone important changes,
    not least by adhering to ISO International Standards on terminology work (ISO
    704:2000 Terminology Work—Principles and Methods; ISO 1087-1:2000 Terminology
    Work—Vocabulary—Part 1: Theory and Application; ISO 10241:1992 International Terminology
    Standards—Preparation and Layout). A recent critique (Mari 2009 Metrologia 46
    L11–L15)—based on Object-Oriented Analysis—centres on the meaning and relation
    of the two first and fundamental concepts ‘quantity’Single quotation marks (‘…’)
    or bold type indicate a concept when necessary, double quotation marks (“…”) a
    term or quotation. and the new entry ‘kind-of-quantity’. This makes it timely
    to analyse the two concepts, their relation and their respective role in forming
    the generic hierarchical concept system of VIM3 from ‘property’ to individual
    quantities. It is suggested that ‘kind-of-quantity’ acts as a division criterionSynonyms
    are “criterion of subdivision”, “type of characteristic(s)”, see the annexe..</p>"
