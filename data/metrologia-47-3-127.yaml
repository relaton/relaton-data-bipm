  content: '<p>The recent third edition of the <italic>International Vocabulary of
    Metrology—Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms</italic> (VIM3) (JCGM
    200:2008 (Sèvres: BIPM); also <italic>ISO/IEC Guide</italic> 99:2007 3rd edn (Geneva:
    ISO)) has undergone important changes, not least by adhering to ISO International
    Standards on terminology work (ISO 704:2000 <italic>Terminology Work—Principles
    and Methods</italic>; ISO 1087-1:2000 <italic>Terminology Work—Vocabulary—Part
    1: Theory and Application</italic>; ISO 10241:1992 <italic>International Terminology

    Analysis—centres on the meaning and relation of the two first and fundamental
    concepts ‘quantity’Single quotation marks (‘…’) or bold type indicate a concept
    when necessary, double quotation marks (“…”) a term or quotation. and the new
    entry ‘kind-of-quantity’. This makes it timely to analyse the two concepts, their
    relation and their respective role in forming the generic hierarchical concept
    system of VIM3 from ‘property’ to individual quantities. It is suggested that
    ‘kind-of-quantity’ acts as a division criterionSynonyms are “criterion of subdivision”,
    “type of characteristic(s)”, see the annexe..</p>'
