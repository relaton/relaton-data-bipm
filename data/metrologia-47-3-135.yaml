abstract:
- content: "<p>Leak detection is widely used nowadays in various fields such as the
    automotive and refrigeration industries. The leak tightness of installations charged
    with refrigerants must be controlled periodically by refrigerant gas detectors,
    qualified by refrigerant leaks called reference leaks or ‘calibrated’ leaks. To
    this day, those refrigerant leaks are not traceable to the SI units under their
    operating conditions. Therefore, a project involving the LNE, the CEP and the
    ADEME was initiated in order to develop a national standard for calibrating refrigerant
    reference leaks.</p><p>The method consists in measuring the accumulation of gas
    due to the refrigerant leak inside a closed volume at atmospheric pressure. The
    leak flow rate is deduced from the concentration variation, measured with a photo-acoustic
    spectrometer, the pressure and temperature in the accumulation volume and the
    capacity of the accumulation volume. The uncertainty budget thus takes into account
    the measurement uncertainties of these quantities. The main components of the
    uncertainty are due to the accumulation volume capacity and the measurement of
    concentration. The relative expanded uncertainty of leak flow rates between 1 g yr<sup>−1</sup>
    and 50 g yr<sup>−1</sup> is around 2%, depending on the value of the leak.</p>"
