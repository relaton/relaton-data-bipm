abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper analyses two possible estimators for the modulus of a complex-valued
    quantity. Their expectations are here recalled from a previous work and their
    variances and mean square errors (MSEs) are analytically derived in the case of
    uncorrelated, homoskedastic and normally distributed measurements of the real
    and imaginary parts of the considered quantity. Numerical simulations are performed
    in the case of (uncorrelated) heteroskedastic measurements of the real and imaginary
    parts. The two estimators are compared by studying the behaviour of their variances
    and MSEs, and some guidance is given on the best choice between the two, depending
    on the specific experimental context. First and second-order approximations for
    their variance, hence for the uncertainty associated with the estimates they produce,
    are also provided in a more general case, that is, for correlated and heteroskedastic
    measurements of the real and imaginary parts. Examples from the metrological and
    the physical fields are given in order to compare the estimators on actual data.</p>"
