abstract:
- content: "<p>A design of an automated cryogenic current comparator (CCC) resistance
    ratio bridge for routine measurements in a national metrology institute or standards
    laboratory is described. It employs a type II CCC for use in a low loss liquid
    helium storage vessel and can be continuously operated from the mains power via
    specialized isolated supplies. All parameters including the servo control loops
    are digitally controlled. Noise sources in the system are analysed using the Allan
    deviation and it is demonstrated that non-white noise sources can be eliminated
    by choosing an appropriate current reversal rate.</p>"
