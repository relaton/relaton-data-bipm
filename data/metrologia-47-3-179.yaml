  content: "<p>The main aim of this paper is to calculate the small but significant
    amount of heat lost from a graphite calorimeter absorber through connecting thermistor
    wires during electrical calibration. Taking into account the electro-thermal interaction
    between the heating thermistor and its surrounding environment, a more realistic
    approach to the problem was developed and estimative numerical results were obtained.
    It was found that the wires contribute about 0.01% in extracting heat from the
    calorimeter core (which corresponds to a correction factor \n<italic>k</italic><sub>w</sub><sup>core</sup>
    = 0.9999). The total correction factor for heat loss through the connecting thermistor
    wires during the electrical calibration of the calorimeter (the total combined
    effect of the heater and the sensor leads due to conduction, radiation and Joule
    effect) was determined: <italic>k</italic><sub>w</sub> = 0.9989.</p>"
