abstract:
- content: "<p>A second-generation standard hygrometer has been completed at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This hygrometer measures humidity
    using a gravimetric method: it separates the water from the carrier gas and afterwards
    measures the water mass and carrier gas mass. These two measurements determine
    the mass ratio r (the ratio of the measured water mass to the measured dry-gas
    mass). The new design allows automated continuous gas collection at up to 3 L min<sup>−1</sup>.
    This enables the hygrometer to collect larger amounts of gas and thereby measure
    humidity values lower than that measured by the previous NIST standard hygrometer.
    When operated in an optimal thermal environment (minimal thermal loads in the
    laboratory), the total expanded relative uncertainty (k = 2) of the gravimetric
    hygrometer is approximately 0.1% for atmospheric-pressure frost points higher
    than −35 °C (r = 250 µg g<sup>−1</sup>). Below this frost point the total expanded
    relative uncertainty gradually increases to approximately 1% at −55 °C (r = 13 µg g<sup>−1</sup>).
    The hygrometer has measured the humidity of gas samples produced by the NIST Hybrid
    Generator and the NIST Low Frost-Point Generator with dew/frost points from −35 °C
    to 71 °C. For both generators the differences between the humidity generated and
    the humidity measured by the gravimetric hygrometer are less than the combined
    uncertainties of the generator and the hygrometer.</p>"
