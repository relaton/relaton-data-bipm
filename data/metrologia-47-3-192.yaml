  content: "<p>A second-generation standard hygrometer has been completed at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This hygrometer measures humidity
    using a gravimetric method: it separates the water from the carrier gas and afterwards
    measures the water mass and carrier gas mass. These two measurements determine
    the mass ratio <italic>r</italic> (the ratio of the measured water mass to the
    measured dry-gas mass). The new design allows automated continuous gas collection
    at up to 3 L min<sup>−1</sup>. This enables the hygrometer to collect larger amounts
    of gas and thereby measure humidity values lower than that measured by the previous
    NIST standard hygrometer. When operated in an optimal thermal environment (minimal
    thermal loads in the laboratory), the total expanded relative uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2) of the gravimetric hygrometer is approximately 0.1% for atmospheric-pressure
    frost points higher than −35 °C (<italic>r</italic> = 250 µg g<sup>−1</sup>).
    Below this frost point the total expanded relative uncertainty gradually increases
    to approximately 1% at −55 °C (<italic>r</italic> = 13 µg g<sup>−1</sup>). The
    hygrometer has measured the humidity of gas samples produced by the NIST Hybrid
    Generator and the NIST Low Frost-Point Generator with dew/frost points from −35 °C
    to 71 °C. For both generators the differences between the humidity generated and
    the humidity measured by the gravimetric hygrometer are less than the combined
    uncertainties of the generator and the hygrometer.</p>"
