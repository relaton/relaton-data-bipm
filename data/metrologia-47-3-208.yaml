abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents a practical ultrasonic system for near real-time
    imaging of spatial temperature distributions in water caused by absorption of
    radiation. Initial testing with radiation from a highly attenuated infrared lamp
    demonstrates that the system is able to map sub-millikelvin temperature changes,
    thus making it suitable for characterizing dose profiles of therapy-level ionizing
    radiation beams. The system uses a fan-beam tomographic reconstruction algorithm
    to invert time-of-flight data derived from ultrasonic pulses produced and detected
    by a circular array of transducers immersed in water. Temperature dependence of
    the speed of sound in water permits the conversion of these measured two-dimensional
    velocity distributions into temperature distributions that indicate the absorbed
    radiation dose. The laboratory prototype, based on a 128-element transducer array,
    is used to acquire temperature maps of a 230 mm × 230 mm area every 4 s with sub-millikelvin
    resolution in temperature and about 5 mm resolution in space. Earlier measurements
    with a single-channel version of this prototype suggest refinements in signal-conditioning
    electronics and signal-processing algorithms that would allow the present instrument
    to resolve temperature changes as low as a few microkelvin. Possible applications
    include real-time intensity profiling of radiation beams and three-dimensional
    characterization of the absorbed dose.</p>"
