  content: "<p>The paper introduces a distinction between true metric and parametric
    quantities, units and dimensions. It claims in its first part that these distinctions
    shed important light both on the base quantity amount of substance and VIM's definitions
    of kind of quantity and quantity dimension. The second part is devoted to the
    unit one, and it claims that this unit must be regarded as a parametric unit,
    but also that it is not as needed as has been thought. The third part takes for
    granted that both the mole and the unit one are parametric units, and it argues
    that, for pedagogical reasons, the mole should be exchanged for the unit one,
    and the parametric quantity amount of substance be renamed as ‘elementary entities’.</p>"
