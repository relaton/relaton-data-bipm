  content: "<p>An indirect determination of the thermodynamic temperature of the fixed
    point of copper was made at INRIM by measuring four cells with a Si-based and
    an InGaAs-based precision radiation thermometer carrying approximated thermodynamic
    scales realized up to the Ag point. An average value <italic>T</italic><sub>Cu</sub>
    = 1357.840 K was found with a standard uncertainty of 0.047 K. A consequent (<italic>T</italic>
    − <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>)<sub>Cu</sub> value of 70 mK can be derived
    which is 18 mK higher than, but consistent with, the presently available (<italic>T</italic>
    − <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>)<sub>Cu</sub> as elaborated by the CCT-WG4.</p>"
