abstract:
- content: "<p>We have developed a blackbody comparison system to validate the fixed-point
    realization of the thermocouple temperature scale using the radiation thermometry
    scale. Platinum/palladium, type S and type B thermocouples were calibrated at
    the fixed points of Ag, Cu, Fe–C, Co–C and Pd (only for type B). The radiation
    thermometer used was an LP4 linear pyrometer operating at a central wavelength
    of 650 nm. To assign the Fe–C eutectic melting temperature in our laboratory,
    a radiometric Fe–C cell was fabricated, and its melting temperature was determined
    as (1154.0 ± 0.1) °C with k = 2. Two scales were compared from 962 °C to 1555 °C
    in the blackbody comparison system. The two scales were consistent within 0.5 °C
    up to 1400 °C, but the discrepancy for the type B thermocouple increased to 2.3 °C
    at 1554.8 °C. The thermocouple and radiometric scales realized at our laboratory
    were in agreement up to the freezing temperature of Pd within the measurement
    uncertainty.</p>"
