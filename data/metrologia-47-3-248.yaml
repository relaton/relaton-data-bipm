  content: "<p>We have measured the heat flux accompanying the melting or freezing
    of metal (or metalloid)–carbon eutectics, using differential scanning calorimetry
    (DSC) to identify appropriate binary systems for secondary thermometry fixed points.
    Well-known alloy systems such as Fe–C and Ni–C showed reproducible endothermic
    and exothermic peaks that represent melting and freezing reactions in the DSC
    measurement. Furthermore, a new Si–C system with a eutectic composition showed
    reproducible melting and freezing peaks in the DSC measurements. Based on the
    results by DSC, we identified the Si–SiC eutectic point as a possible eutectic
    fixed point. To confirm this possibility, we made a Si–SiC cell for thermocouple
    thermometry and measured its melting and freezing characteristics using a Pt/Pd
    thermocouple. The melting temperature of the Si–SiC eutectic was reproducible
    to within 0.02 °C (one standard deviation). From the results, we found that Si–SiC
    has possibility as a new eutectic fixed point at temperatures around 1400 °C.
    We also concluded that DSC analysis could be used to measure the reproducibility
    of freezing and melting reactions that are to be used as fixed points for thermometry,
    because it is a rapid and easy-to-use tool for characterizing the thermal behaviour
    of materials with only a small sample.</p>"
