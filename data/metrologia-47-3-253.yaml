  content: "<p>The measurement of layer thickness by compositional secondary ion mass
    spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling is investigated for Si/Ge multilayer films
    using an oxygen ion beam. The original SIMS depth profiles were converted into
    compositional depth profiles by the relative sensitivity factors of Si and Ge
    derived from a Si<sub>52.4</sub>Ge<sub>47.6</sub> alloy reference film. The locations
    of the interfaces in the Si/Ge multilayer films could be well determined by 50 at%
    definition where the relative composition of the constituent layer elements drops
    or rises to 50 at%. The layer thicknesses of Si and Ge of a test Si/Ge multilayer
    film were determined by the sputtering rates of Si and Ge determined from a reference
    Si/Ge multilayer film. Although the difference between the measured and the actual
    thicknesses is increased as the ion energy is increased, the layer thicknesses
    determined at low ion energies were very close to the actual values.</p>"
