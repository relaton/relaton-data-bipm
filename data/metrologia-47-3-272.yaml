abstract:
- content: "<p>Johnson noise thermometers (JNT) measure the equilibrium electrical
    noise, proportional to thermodynamic temperature, of a sensing resistor. In the
    correlation method, the same resistor is connected to two amplifiers and a correlation
    of their outputs is performed, in order to reject amplifiers' noise. Such rejection
    is not perfect: the residual correlation gives a systematic error in the JNT reading.
    In order to set an upper limit, or to achieve a correction, for such error, a
    careful electrical modelling of the amplifiers and connections must be performed.
    Standard numerical simulation tools are inadequate for such modelling. In the
    literature, evaluations have been performed by the painstaking solving of analytical
    modelling. We propose an evaluation procedure for the JNT error due to residual
    correlations which blends analytical and numerical approaches, with the benefits
    of both: a rigorous and accurate circuit noise modelling, and a fast and flexible
    evaluation with a user-friendly commercial tool. The method is applied to a simple
    but very effective ultralow-noise amplifier employed in a working JNT.</p>"
