  content: "<p>Johnson noise thermometers (JNT) measure the equilibrium electrical
    noise, proportional to thermodynamic temperature, of a sensing resistor. In the
    <italic>correlation method</italic>, the same resistor is connected to two amplifiers
    and a correlation of their outputs is performed, in order to reject amplifiers'
    noise. Such rejection is not perfect: the residual correlation gives a systematic
    error in the JNT reading. In order to set an upper limit, or to achieve a correction,
    for such error, a careful electrical modelling of the amplifiers and connections
    must be performed. Standard numerical simulation tools are inadequate for such
    modelling. In the literature, evaluations have been performed by the painstaking
    solving of analytical modelling. We propose an evaluation procedure for the JNT
    error due to residual correlations which blends analytical and numerical approaches,
    with the benefits of both: a rigorous and accurate circuit noise modelling, and
    a fast and flexible evaluation with a user-friendly commercial tool. The method
    is applied to a simple but very effective ultralow-noise amplifier employed in
    a working JNT.</p>"
