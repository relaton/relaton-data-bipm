  content: "<p>We have developed a set of seven observational equations that include
    all of the physics necessary to relate the most important of the fundamental constants
    to the definitions of the SI kilogram and ampere. We have used these to determine
    the influence of alternative definitions currently under consideration for the
    SI kilogram and ampere on the uncertainty of three of the fundamental constants
    (<italic>h</italic>, <italic>e</italic> and <italic>m</italic><sub>u</sub>). We
    have also reviewed the experimental evidence for the exactness of the quantum
    metrology triangle resulting from experiments combining the quantum Hall effect,
    the Josephson effects and single-electron tunnelling.</p>"
