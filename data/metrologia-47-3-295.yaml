abstract:
- content: "<p>The basis for the description of diffuse reflecting materials is the
    concept of the radiance factor β, or as a quite similar depiction, the bidirectional
    reflectance distribution function f<sub>r</sub>. Both characterizations use the
    concept of the perfectly reflecting diffuser (PRD), which reflects, by definition,
    the incoming radiation loss-free, completely diffuse and with Lambertian direction
    characteristics. The PRD is a theoretical concept only, which cannot be realized
    materially. Since there is no material with these characteristics, the realization
    is carried out with physical methods, i.e. by the measuring apparatus itself,
    in the context of an absolute measurement. For practical purposes, radiance factor
    measurements are predominantly accomplished relative to commercially available
    reflection standards. In the present investigation, different widely used diffuse
    reflection materials were measured for the first time in a multi-geometry configuration
    with the robot-based gonioreflectometer of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB) in order to characterize their three-dimensional reflection behaviour. For
    a set of four distinct incident angles, the full hemispherical reflection indicatrix
    was determined at a wavelength of 550 nm.</p><p>The angle-resolved reflection
    data are an important reference for manufacturers, providers and users of radiometric
    and photometric products. This paper attempts to give users in research and industry
    an overview of the strongly non-Lambertian reflection behaviour of standard reflection
    materials, because it is a widespread false assumption that commonly used standard
    reflection materials have only minor deviations from the ideal specification of
    the PRD.</p>"
