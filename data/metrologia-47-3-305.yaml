abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents a time transfer method based on a least-square
    analysis of the GPS code and carrier-phase measurements in common view (CV), constrained
    by TWSTFT (TW hereafter) data. Combining GPS and TWSTFT considerably increases
    the robustness of the remote clock comparisons thanks to the complete independence
    between these two techniques. An additional goal of the combination (named CV
    + TW) is to provide a time transfer solution, which benefits from the high short-term
    stability and high resolution of the GPS data and from the high accuracy of the
    TW data. The final solution is then calibrated by the TW data rather than by the
    GPS pseudoranges. As a consequence, the large day-boundary discontinuities that
    can exist in GPS time transfer solutions disappear in the combined solution, and
    are replaced by smaller discontinuities the magnitude of which depends on the
    noise level of the TW link. For a very noisy link, we found jumps up to 1 ns,
    while for the very quiet link NIST–OP, they are all lower than 200 ps.</p>"
