abstract:
- content: "<p>Adaptive Monte Carlo schemes can be used to determine the number of
    Monte Carlo trials (the number of evaluations of the measurement model) necessary
    for the evaluation of uncertainty according to Supplement 1 to the GUM (GUM S1).
    The goal is to reach a prescribed numerical accuracy of the Monte Carlo results
    (the estimate, associated standard uncertainty and coverage interval endpoints)
    for a chosen confidence level. It is shown that simple sequential adaptive Monte
    Carlo schemes may not perform well in this regard and an alternative method based
    on a two-stage procedure due to Stein is proposed. The implementation of this
    two-stage scheme for GUM S1 is described, and its performance and robustness are
    demonstrated in terms of simulation results.</p>"
