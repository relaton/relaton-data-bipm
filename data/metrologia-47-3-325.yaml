  content: "<p>The range 3.0 K to 24.5561 K of the International Temperature Scale
    of 1990 (ITS-90) was realized at VSL with a <sup>4</sup>He interpolating constant-volume
    gas thermometer (ICVGT). The standard uncertainty of the generated scale ranged
    from 0.32 mK at 3.3 K to 0.38 mK at 24.5561 K. The ICVGT scale was compared with
    the classical absolute gas thermometer scales of the National Physical Laboratory
    (NPL-75, 1975) and the Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratory (KOL, 1986) and was found to
    deviate from them by a maximum of 1.5 mK. The non-uniqueness of the generated
    scale was investigated by comparing it with alternative ICVGT scales (but having
    equal status because still satisfying all the requirements of the ITS-90) obtained
    from different choices of the lowest calibration temperature and interpolation
    function. The size of correction effects such as thermo-molecular pressure, aerostatic
    head pressure and dead volume was calculated and the effectiveness of the ICVGT
    calibration procedure in compensating for such correction effects was evaluated.</p>"
