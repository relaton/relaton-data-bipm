abstract:
- content: "<p>A recent paper (Baumann et al 2009 Metrologia 46 178–86) presents a
    method to evaluate the free-fall acceleration at a desired point in space, as
    required for the watt balance experiment. The claimed uncertainty of their absolute
    gravity measurements is supported by two bilateral comparisons using two absolute
    gravimeters of the same type. This comment discusses the case where absolute gravity
    measurements are traceable to a key comparison reference value. Such an approach
    produces a more complete uncertainty budget and reduces the risk of the results
    of different watt balance experiments not being compatible.</p>"
