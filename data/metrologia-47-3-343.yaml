  content: <p>The method of uncertainty evaluation discussed in <italic>Supplement
    1</italic> to the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>
    generates a coverage interval in which the measurand is said to have a certain
    probability (the coverage probability) of lying. This communication contains a
    response to the recent claim that ‘when a coverage interval summarizes the resulting
    state of knowledge, the coverage probability should not be interpreted as a relative
    frequency of successful intervals in a large series of imagined or simulated intervals’
    (Lira <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/46/6/002">2009
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>46</bold> 616–8</ext-link>). First, Bernoulli's
    law of large numbers is used to prove that the long-run success rate of a methodology
    used to calculate 95% coverage intervals must be 95%. Second, the usual definition
    of subjective probability or ‘degree of belief’ is stated, and the weak law of
    large numbers is then used to show that this definition—and the corresponding
    definition of ‘state of knowledge’—relies on the concept of long-run behaviour.
    This provides an alternative proof of the same result.</p>
