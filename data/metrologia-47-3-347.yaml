abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2009 Metrologia 46 616–8 it is claimed that a coverage probability
    associated with an interval derived from a state-of-knowledge probability distribution
    should not be interpreted as a relative frequency of successful intervals in a
    large series of imagined or simulated intervals. In his comments, Willink affirms
    that this claim is untenable. This reply is limited to a summary restatement of
    the two examples used to support the above assertion.</p>"
