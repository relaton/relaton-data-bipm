    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>46</bold> 616–8</ext-link> it is claimed that
    a coverage probability associated with an interval derived from a state-of-knowledge
    probability distribution should not be interpreted as a relative frequency of
    successful intervals in a large series of imagined or simulated intervals. In
    his comments, Willink affirms that this claim is untenable. This reply is limited
    to a summary restatement of the two examples used to support the above assertion.</p>
