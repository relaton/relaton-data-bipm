abstract:
- content: "<p>The fundamental concept of the mole requires the number of entities
    comprising one mole, i.e. Avogadro's number, to be exactly equal to the gram-to-dalton
    mass ratio. If this compatibility condition is to be satisfied, the mole, the
    kilogram and the dalton cannot all be defined independently. This note concerns
    recent Metrologia publications that do, however, propose independent definitions
    of all three quantities: the mole by fixing the value of Avogadro's number and
    the kilogram by fixing the value of the Planck constant, while retaining the current
    carbon-12-based dalton. Adoption of these incompatible definitions would likely
    cause serious widespread confusion and might even result in a split in scholarly
    and technical communication between the quantum physics and chemistry communities.
    Other entirely compatible alternatives are possible: either retaining the current
    (inexact) carbon-12-based mole and dalton with an independently redefined kilogram
    or redefining the mole by fixing the value of Avogadro's number, with a compatible
    dalton that is exact in terms of the redefined kilogram.</p>"
