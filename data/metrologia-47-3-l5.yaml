  content: "<p>The fundamental concept of the mole requires the number of entities
    comprising one mole, i.e. Avogadro's number, to be exactly equal to the gram-to-dalton
    mass ratio. If this compatibility condition is to be satisfied, the mole, the
    kilogram and the dalton cannot all be defined independently. This note concerns
    recent <italic>Metrologia</italic> publications that do, however, propose independent
    definitions of all three quantities: the mole by fixing the value of Avogadro's
    number and the kilogram by fixing the value of the Planck constant, while retaining
    the current carbon-12-based dalton. Adoption of these incompatible definitions
    would likely cause serious widespread confusion and might even result in a split
    in scholarly and technical communication between the quantum physics and chemistry
    communities. Other entirely compatible alternatives are possible: either retaining
    the current (inexact) carbon-12-based mole and dalton with an independently redefined
    kilogram or redefining the mole by fixing the value of Avogadro's number, with
    a compatible dalton that is exact in terms of the redefined kilogram.</p>"
