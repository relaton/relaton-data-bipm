abstract:
- content: "<p>The publication of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    (GUM), and later of its Supplement 1, can be considered to be landmarks in the
    field of metrology. The second of these documents recommends a general Monte Carlo
    method for numerically constructing the probability distribution of a measurand
    given the probability distributions of its input quantities. The output probability
    distribution can be used to estimate the fixed value of the measurand and to calculate
    the limits of an interval wherein that value is expected to be found with a given
    probability. The approach in Supplement 1 is not restricted to linear or linearized
    models (as is the GUM) but it is limited to a single measurand.</p><p>In this
    paper the theory underlying Supplement 1 is re-examined with a view to covering
    explicit or implicit measurement models that may include any number of output
    quantities. It is shown that the main elements of the theory are Bayes' theorem,
    the principles of probability calculus and the rules for constructing prior probability
    distributions. The focus is on developing an analytical expression for the joint
    probability distribution of all quantities involved. In practice, most times this
    expression will have to be integrated numerically to obtain the distribution of
    the output quantities, but not necessarily by using the Monte Carlo method. It
    is stressed that all quantities are assumed to have unique values, so their probability
    distributions are to be interpreted as encoding states of knowledge that are (i)
    logically consistent with all available information and (ii) conditional on the
    correctness of the measurement model and on the validity of the statistical assumptions
    that are used to process the measurement data. A rigorous notation emphasizes
    this interpretation.</p>"
