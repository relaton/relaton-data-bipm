abstract:
- content: "<p>Three methods for the determination of the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) and degree of equivalence of inconsistent comparison data are proposed
    in this study. These methods are, respectively, based on the premises of (1) unknown
    biases of individual measurement values, (2) underestimated uncertainties of individual
    participants or (3) additional and common uncertainty. Bayesian statistics were
    employed for the analysis using locally uniform priors. In the case of the first
    premise, Procedure B in the CIPM guidelines (2002 Metrologia 39 589â€“95) can be
    derived in the Bayesian context. In the case of the second and the third premises,
    the weighted mean is a possible candidate for the KCRV. These methods are exemplified
    using the key comparison data of CIPM CCM.FF-K3 and APMP.L-K1. Markov chain Monte
    Carlo simulations were conducted for calculations based on the latter two premises.
    From the results obtained, it is considered that, in addition to Procedure B in
    the CIPM guidelines, the method based on the second premise is also a robust method
    for the estimation of the KCRV.</p>"
