abstract:
- content: "<p>We present the connection of two programmable Josephson arrays generating
    synchronous waveforms to measure impedance ratios—the Josephson two-terminal-pair
    impedance bridge. This approach is more flexible than conventional bridges at
    the same level of uncertainty. The Josephson bridge can measure over a wider frequency
    range, over a wider range of impedance ratios than conventional two-terminal-pair
    bridges. Furthermore, the phase angle between the two impedances can take any
    value. As a first application, we present measurements of a 1 : 1 resistance ratio
    at the 10 kΩ level in the frequency range between 25 Hz and 10 kHz. The uncertainties
    are better than a few parts in 10<sup>8</sup> and hence comparable to those of
    conventional impedance bridges. Quantization at up to 10 kHz was confirmed by
    varying the bias current of the Josephson arrays, resulting in constant resistance
    ratios within the measurement resolution.</p>"
