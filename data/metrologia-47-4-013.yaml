abstract:
- content: "<p>A traceability chain for the derivation of the farad from dc quantum
    Hall effect has been recently implemented at INRIM. The main components of the
    chain are two coaxial transformer bridges: a resistance ratio bridge and a quadrature
    bridge, both operating at 1541 Hz.</p><p>Both bridges are energized and controlled
    by a polyphase sinewave direct-digital-synthesizer; the automated control of relative
    amplitudes and phases of the generator voltage outputs permits principal and auxiliary
    balances of each bridge to be achieved. Such a technique, which may be called
    digital assistance, is implemented for the first time in an ohm–farad traceability
    chain.</p><p>The relative standard uncertainty in the realization of the farad,
    at the level of 1000 pF, is estimated to be 64 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. A first verification
    of the realization is given by a comparison with the maintained INRIM capacitance
    standard, where an agreement within a relative combined standard uncertainty of
    420 × 10<sup>−9</sup> is obtained.</p>"
