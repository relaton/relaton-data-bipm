abstract:
- content: "<p>An accuracy evaluation of the caesium fountain NPL-CsF2 as a primary
    frequency standard is reported. The device operates with a simple one-stage magneto-optical
    trap as the source of cold atoms. Both the uncertainty in and magnitude of the
    cold collision frequency shift are reduced by taking advantage of the dependence
    of the cross section on the effective collision energy in an expanding atomic
    cloud. The combined type B uncertainty (typically 4 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) is dominated
    by an estimate of the frequency shift due to the distributed cavity phase. When
    operated at single density, the short-term fractional frequency instability of
    NPL-CsF2 is 1.7 × 10<sup>−13</sup> at 1 s and limited by the noise of the room
    temperature quartz-based local oscillator. During a typical frequency measurement
    campaign, the fountain is operated in an alternating mode at high and low density
    in order to measure and correct for a residual collision shift. This increases
    the effective fractional frequency instability to 5.4 × 10<sup>−13</sup> at 1 s;
    consequently the averaging time required for the type A uncertainty level to match
    that of the type B is 20 days.</p>"
