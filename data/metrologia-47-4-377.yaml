  content: "<p>The variation of the response of instruments as a function of neutron
    energy has to be determined in well-characterized mono-energetic neutron fields.
    These fields are measured in terms of neutron fluence and mean energy of the mono-energetic
    neutron peak, providing values that are required to determine the related dosimetric
    quantities. At the IRSN AMANDE facility, the reference measurement standard for
    neutron energy is based on the time of flight (ToF) method, i.e. on a determination
    of the neutron velocity, requiring a pulsed beam and fast detectors. In this study,
    we describe the experimental and theoretical aspects of the development of this
    method for neutron energies above 1 MeV using liquid scintillators. We present
    the adopted experimental protocol and give full details of the estimation of uncertainties
    associated with the neutron energy measurement. To extract as accurately as possible
    the mean energy from the experimental neutron ToF distribution, a simulated energy
    distribution is fitted to the measurements. This simulation includes a detailed
    analysis of the energy resolution, taking into account all the contributions influencing
    the ToF measurements. Comparison with neutron energy calculated from kinematics
    leads to the conclusion that the ToF method at the AMANDE facility can be considered
    as a reference measurement standard for neutron energies between 1 MeV and 20 MeV,
    with a relative uncertainty lower than 1.5%.</p>"
