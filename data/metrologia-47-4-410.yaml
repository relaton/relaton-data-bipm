abstract:
- content: "<p>Platinum–iridium (Pt/Ir) kilogram mass prototypes are known to gain
    contamination from the environment in which they are stored. The current method
    of cleaning these mass prototypes is called nettoyage–lavage and involves the
    physical rubbing of a kilogram with a chamois leather cloth soaked in a solvent
    followed by removal of any solvent residue using a jet of steam water. The manual
    nature of the technique means the effectiveness of the cleaning process is reliant
    on the human operative. An alternative cleaning method involving exposure to ultraviolet
    light and ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) has been tested on Pt/Ir foils and kilogram
    mass prototypes. The changes to the surface of the Pt/Ir foils as a result of
    this process have been quantified using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and have
    shown a clear reduction in the quantity of carbonaceous contamination. Variation
    of the UV intensity, ozone concentration and exposure duration enabled the optimum
    cleaning conditions to be established. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> cleaning method was
    then used to clean two Pt/Ir kilogram mass prototypes and gravimetric weighing
    of the kilograms before and after cleaning gave the amount of contamination removed.
    These gravimetric weighing results demonstrated that UV/O<sub>3</sub> cleaning
    was as effective as the nettoyage–lavage process.</p>"
