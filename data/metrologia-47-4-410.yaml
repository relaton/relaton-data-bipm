  content: "<p>Platinum–iridium (Pt/Ir) kilogram mass prototypes are known to gain
    contamination from the environment in which they are stored. The current method
    of cleaning these mass prototypes is called <italic>nettoyage–lavage</italic>
    and involves the physical rubbing of a kilogram with a chamois leather cloth soaked
    in a solvent followed by removal of any solvent residue using a jet of steam water.
    The manual nature of the technique means the effectiveness of the cleaning process
    is reliant on the human operative. An alternative cleaning method involving exposure
    to ultraviolet light and ozone (UV/O<sub>3</sub>) has been tested on Pt/Ir foils
    and kilogram mass prototypes. The changes to the surface of the Pt/Ir foils as
    a result of this process have been quantified using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
    and have shown a clear reduction in the quantity of carbonaceous contamination.
    Variation of the UV intensity, ozone concentration and exposure duration enabled
    the optimum cleaning conditions to be established. The UV/O<sub>3</sub> cleaning
    method was then used to clean two Pt/Ir kilogram mass prototypes and gravimetric
    weighing of the kilograms before and after cleaning gave the amount of contamination
    removed. These gravimetric weighing results demonstrated that UV/O<sub>3</sub>
    cleaning was as effective as the <italic>nettoyage–lavage</italic> process.</p>"
