  content: "<p>In view of the proposed redefinition of the kilogram, in 2005, 2007
    and 2010 the CCM adopted recommendations and conditions to be met before the redefinition
    is implemented. Some of these conditions concern the uncertainty by which the
    kilogram will be realized after the redefinition. This uncertainty has become
    a point of discussion in other committees, because the needs for this value were
    not sufficiently transparent. Here, examples of the realization of the new kilogram
    with different uncertainties, along with the experimental results available from
    the Avogadro and watt balance experiments, the uncertainties of mass determinations
    and their propagation with reasonable assumptions are presented, in order to compare
    possible realization uncertainties with the requirements in practice. It turned
    out that the CCM conditions are reasonable, if major changes in the dissemination
    chain of the kilogram are to be avoided.</p>"
