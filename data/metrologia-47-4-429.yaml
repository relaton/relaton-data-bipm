abstract:
- content: "<p>In 2004, the National Institute of Standards and Technology established
    the ultraviolet spectral irradiance scale from 200 nm to 400 nm using the calculable
    irradiance of the Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility (SURF). Since the
    establishment of the scale, spectral irradiance calibrations of many customer
    lamps have been performed in direct comparison with synchrotron radiation. However,
    to ensure long-term stability of the scale, three check-standard deuterium lamps
    were calibrated using SURF III at the same time as customer lamps were being calibrated.
    Here, we present the results of the long-term monitoring of the scale using these
    check-standard lamps to ensure customer lamps are calibrated within the expanded
    calibration uncertainty (k = 2) of 1.2%.</p>"
