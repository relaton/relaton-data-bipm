  content: "<p>A new method applying isotope dilution mass spectrometry to determine
    the molar mass of a silicon sample, highly enriched with respect to <sup>28</sup>Si,
    has been proposed recently. This paper describes a different way of calculating
    the molar mass by solving an equation linking the measurement results to the ratio
    between the amount-of-substance fractions of <sup>28</sup>Si and <sup>30</sup>Si
    in the sample. The mathematical model and the final measurement equation are much
    more straightforward than those previously reported, though fully equivalent.</p>"
