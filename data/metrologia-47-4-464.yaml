    <p>A traceability chain for the derivation of the farad from dc quantum Hall effect has been recently implemented at INRIM. The main components of the chain are two coaxial transformer bridges: a resistance ratio bridge and a quadrature bridge, both operating at 1541 Hz.</p>
    <p>Both bridges are energized and controlled by a polyphase sinewave direct-digital-synthesizer; the automated control of relative amplitudes and phases of the generator voltage outputs permits principal and auxiliary balances of each bridge to be achieved. Such a technique, which may be called <italic>digital assistance</italic>, is implemented for the first time in an ohm–farad traceability chain.</p>
    <p>The relative standard uncertainty in the realization of the farad, at the level of 1000 pF, is estimated to be 64 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. A first verification of the realization is given by a comparison with the maintained INRIM capacitance standard, where an agreement within a relative combined standard uncertainty of 420 × 10<sup>−9</sup> is obtained.</p>
