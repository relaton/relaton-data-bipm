abstract:
- content: "<p>We report on a successful 20-year study, involving a national metrology
    institute and a commercial instrument manufacturer, in the field of gauge block
    measurement by optical interferometry. The National Physical Laboratory (NPL)
    has made measurements of length artefacts on its own equipment and on 30 copies
    of this instrument that are now in use worldwide. Several NPL length artefacts
    have been measured on all 31 instruments including repeated re-measurement of
    the artefacts on the same equipment at NPL, over a period of 20 years. This pool
    of data therefore allows for quantitative examination of the temporal stability
    of these standards as well as the long-term performance of the instruments and
    of the evolving instrument design. Many of the laboratories which now own these
    instruments have taken part in international comparisons under the Comité International
    des Poids et Mesures' Mutual Recognition Arrangement. Combining the data from
    these key comparisons with the data obtained by NPL allows for a novel analysis—these
    data can be regarded as coming from an international key comparison, where both
    the artefact and the measuring instrument are circulated amongst the participants—the
    remaining variability being due to operator skill at the different laboratories,
    and the quality of their independent traceability chains.</p>"
