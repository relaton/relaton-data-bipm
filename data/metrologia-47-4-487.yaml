abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports work undertaken to assess the change in the mass
    values of stainless steel and platinum–iridium weights transferred between air
    and vacuum and to determine the repeatability of this change. Sets of kilogram
    transfer standards, manufactured from stainless steel and platinum–iridium and
    with different surface areas, were used to determine the effect of transfer between
    air and vacuum on the values of the mass standards. The SI unit of mass is the
    only unit of the seven base SI quantities which is still defined in terms of an
    artefact rather than by relation to a fundamental physical constant. Work is underway
    to identify a means of deriving the SI unit of mass from fundamental constants
    and at present the two principal approaches are the International Avogadro Coordination
    and the watt balance projects. Both of these approaches involve realizing a kilogram
    in vacuum and therefore the traceability from a kilogram realized in vacuum to
    mass standards in air is crucial to the effective dissemination of the mass scale.
    The work reported here characterizes the changes in mass values of standards on
    transfer between air and vacuum and thus will enable traceability to be established
    for an in-air mass scale based on a definition of the unit in vacuum.</p>"
