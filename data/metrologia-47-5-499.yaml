  content: "<p>New comparisons are reported of the triple-point temperatures, <italic>T</italic><sub>tp</sub>,
    of seven neon samples with different <sup>22</sup>Ne amount concentrations, <sup>22</sup><italic>x</italic>,
    in cryogenic cells sealed by INRIM, NMIJ, NPL and PTB. This work stems from a
    collaboration between those laboratories aiming at establishing the relationship
    between <italic>T</italic><sub>tp</sub> and <sup>22</sup><italic>x</italic>. Several
    problems remained unsolved in the published results. The new measurements supply
    more thermal data of lower uncertainty, to help solve some of these problems.
    The detailed results from 35 meltings are reported, characterized by improved
    uncertainty, and include an analysis of calorimetric, thermometric and sample-related
    effects. A broad range of collected and processed information is analysed in detail
    in order to confirm expanded uncertainty levels of the order of 30 µK for a single
    cell and 50 µK for a comparison of pairs of cells. The quality of the INRIM results
    is then discussed. In most cases the uncertainty budget for the INRIM measurements,
    including analysis of chemical impurities and the hydrostatic head correction,
    reached the targeted improved uncertainty. Finally, the results are discussed
    and compared with previous studies in support of the future assignment by the
    CCT of an accurate and reliable relationship <italic>T</italic><sub>tp</sub> versus
    <sup>22</sup><italic>x</italic>. The paper discusses various improvements regarding
    the influence of the thermal measurements on both the uncertainty of the relationship
    and the ability to recognize either possible isotopic fractionation during sample
    preparation or incorrect assignment of <sup>22</sup><italic>x</italic> values
    to some measured samples.</p>"
