abstract:
- content: "<p>New comparisons are reported of the triple-point temperatures, T<sub>tp</sub>,
    of seven neon samples with different<sup>22</sup>Ne amount concentrations,<sup>22</sup>x,
    in cryogenic cells sealed by INRIM, NMIJ, NPL and PTB. This work stems from a
    collaboration between those laboratories aiming at establishing the relationship
    between T<sub>tp</sub> and<sup>22</sup>x. Several problems remained unsolved in
    the published results. The new measurements supply more thermal data of lower
    uncertainty, to help solve some of these problems. The detailed results from 35
    meltings are reported, characterized by improved uncertainty, and include an analysis
    of calorimetric, thermometric and sample-related effects. A broad range of collected
    and processed information is analysed in detail in order to confirm expanded uncertainty
    levels of the order of 30 µK for a single cell and 50 µK for a comparison of pairs
    of cells. The quality of the INRIM results is then discussed. In most cases the
    uncertainty budget for the INRIM measurements, including analysis of chemical
    impurities and the hydrostatic head correction, reached the targeted improved
    uncertainty. Finally, the results are discussed and compared with previous studies
    in support of the future assignment by the CCT of an accurate and reliable relationship
    T<sub>tp</sub> versus<sup>22</sup>x. The paper discusses various improvements
    regarding the influence of the thermal measurements on both the uncertainty of
    the relationship and the ability to recognize either possible isotopic fractionation
    during sample preparation or incorrect assignment of<sup>22</sup>x values to some
    measured samples.</p>"
