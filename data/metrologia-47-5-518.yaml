abstract:
- content: "<p>The absolute single-shot pulse energy of the SPring 8 extreme ultraviolet
    (EUV) free electron laser (FEL) was measured using a cryogenic radiometer with
    a relative standard uncertainty of 3%. The temperature change of the cavity in
    the cryogenic radiometer caused by an incident FEL pulse was determined using
    a lock-in amplifier and an ac Wheatstone bridge. The measured pulse energies were
    compared with a gas-monitor detector developed by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt/Deutsches
    Elektronen-Synchrotron/Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute (Ioffe) at a wavelength
    of 51.3 nm at the SPring-8 EUV-FEL in a shot-to-shot mode. The pulse energies
    measured using the two detectors agree within 2.0%.</p>"
