abstract:
- content: "<p>Analysis of dynamic measurements is of growing importance in metrology
    as an increasing number of applications requires the determination of measurands
    showing a time-dependence. Often linear time-invariant (LTI) systems are appropriate
    for modelling the relation between the available measurement data and the required
    time-dependent values of the measurand. Estimation of the measurand is then carried
    out by deconvolution.</p><p>This paper is a tutorial about the application of
    digital deconvolution filters to reconstruct a time-variable measurand from the
    measurement signal of a LTI measurement apparatus. The goal of the paper is to
    make metrologists aware of the potentialities of digital signal processing in
    such cases. A range of techniques is available for the construction of a digital
    deconvolution filter. Here we compare various approaches for a form of dynamic
    model that is relevant to many metrological applications and we discuss the consequences
    for these approaches of the different ways in which information about the LTI
    system may be expressed. We consider specifically the methods of minimum-phase
    all pass decomposition, asynchronous time reversal using the exact inverse filter
    and the construction of stable infinite impulse response and finite impulse response
    approximate inverse filters by a least squares approach in the frequency domain.
    The methods are compared qualitatively by assessing their numerical complexity
    and quantitatively in terms of their performance for a simulated measurement task.</p><p>Taking
    into account numerical complexity and underlying assumptions of the methods, we
    conclude that when a continuous model of the LTI system is available, or when
    the starting point is a set of measurements of the frequency response of a system,
    application of least squares in the frequency domain for the construction of an
    approximate inverse filter is to be preferred. On the other hand, asynchronous
    time reversal filtering using the exact inverse filter appears superior when a
    discrete model of the LTI system is available and when causality of the deconvolution
    filter is not an issue.</p>"
