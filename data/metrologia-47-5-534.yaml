  content: "<p>We perform 3D finite element calculations of the fields in microwave
    cavities and analyse the distributed cavity phase (DCP) errors of atomic clocks
    that they produce. The fields of cylindrical cavities are treated as an azimuthal
    Fourier series. Each of the lowest components produces clock errors with unique
    characteristics that must be assessed to establish a clock's accuracy. We describe
    the errors and how to evaluate them. We prove that sharp structures in the cavity
    do not produce large frequency errors, even at moderately high powers, provided
    the atomic density varies slowly. We model the amplitude and phase imbalances
    of the feeds. For larger couplings, these can lead to increased phase errors.
    We show that phase imbalances produce a novel DCP error that depends on the cavity
    detuning. We also design improved cavities by optimizing the geometry and tuning
    the mode spectrum so that there are negligible phase variations, allowing this
    source of systematic error to be dramatically reduced.</p>"
