  content: "<p>Results are presented from a theoretical and experimental investigation
    of the frequency transfer uncertainty (FTU) in long-distance comparisons of frequency
    standards. The FTU can be an important component of the total uncertainty in such
    comparisons. The use of the Allan deviation in characterizing the FTU is analysed
    theoretically and it is shown that for certain noise types the Allan deviation
    is biased high. A potentially more accurate first difference statistic that can
    be used in certain situations is also discussed. In addition, an experimental
    determination of the noise types and levels in common transfer techniques is presented.
    It is shown that FTUs approaching 1 part in 10<sup>16</sup> at 30 days are possible
    with current transfer methods. Finally, a method is presented for estimating the
    FTU in calibrating International Atomic Time (TAI) with a primary frequency standard.</p>"
