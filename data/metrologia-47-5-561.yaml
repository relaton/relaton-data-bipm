abstract:
- content: "<p>The size-of-source effect (SSE) of a radiation thermometer is a critical
    uncertainty component in the fixed-point blackbody calibration of a transfer reference
    thermometer in the low-temperature range where the field of view is comparable
    to the size of the blackbody cavity opening. The SSE causes the signal difference
    between the melting and freezing plateaus to increase, and steepens the slopes
    of the plateaus. We propose a new method that can recover the signals of the melting
    and freezing curves that are deteriorated by the SSE, and thereby flatten the
    plateaus. The improvement has been successfully demonstrated using a tin-point
    blackbody. The signal difference between the melting and freezing plateaus was
    reduced from 81 mK to 18 mK, and the freezing-point signal was corrected by 1.30 K.
    In addition, the slopes on the plateaus have been dramatically flattened.</p>"
