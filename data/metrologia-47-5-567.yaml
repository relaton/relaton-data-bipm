  content: "<p>Test masses of absolute gravimeters contain prism or hollow retroreflectors.
    A rotation of such a retroreflector during free-fall can cause a bias in the measured
    <italic>g</italic>-value. In particular, prism retroreflectors produce phase shifts,
    which cannot be eliminated. Such an error is small if the rotation occurs about
    the optical centre of the retroreflector; however, under certain initial conditions
    the error can reach the microgal level. The contribution from these rotation-induced
    accelerations is calculated.</p>"
