abstract:
- content: "<p>Test masses of absolute gravimeters contain prism or hollow retroreflectors.
    A rotation of such a retroreflector during free-fall can cause a bias in the measured
    g-value. In particular, prism retroreflectors produce phase shifts, which cannot
    be eliminated. Such an error is small if the rotation occurs about the optical
    centre of the retroreflector; however, under certain initial conditions the error
    can reach the microgal level. The contribution from these rotation-induced accelerations
    is calculated.</p>"
