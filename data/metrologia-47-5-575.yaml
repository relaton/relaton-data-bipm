abstract:
- content: "<p>The MPG-2 (Max-Planck-Gravimeter) is a transportable absolute gravimeter
    built on a classical free-fall scheme to measure the local gravity value. With
    significant improvements and further investigations in recent years, the standard
    deviation of the mean for a typical measurement over 12 h to 24 h is 1.0 µGal
    to 3.0 µGal (1 µGal = 10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>), and the combined standard
    uncertainty is estimated to be less than 10 µGal. The major improvements include
    the new interferometer design and alignment, longer drop length, reduced recoil
    effects and demagnetization of the falling body. The revised uncertainty budget
    and new measurement results of MPG-2 are reported. The results of observations
    at the reference gravity station Bad Homburg confirmed the revised uncertainty
    budget.</p>"
