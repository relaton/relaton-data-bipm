  content: "<p>In all indexes of the accuracy of gears, the measurement of the error
    of an involute tooth profile is a difficult technical problem. A double-disc instrument
    for measuring an involute is introduced, the measuring principle of which is the
    same as the ‘rolling artefact method’ developed by PTB. In this paper, the measurement
    error caused by deviation of the measurement point is analysed. In order to increase
    the position accuracy of the measurement point, a novel method called the ‘error
    compensation method’ is introduced, which searches for the best position of the
    stylus by tentatively compensating the measurement error caused by deviation of
    the measurement point. According to analysis and experiment, the stylus's adjustment
    deviation by the ‘error compensation method’ is 8 µm.</p>"
