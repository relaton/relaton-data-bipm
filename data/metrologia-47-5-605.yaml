  content: '<p>This paper has two purposes: first, as a tutorial on the use of generalized
    autocovariances for deriving covariance properties of phase-noise models with
    power-law spectra; second, to connect the subject to the theory of generalized
    functions, also called tempered distributions. Proofs of theorems are available
    in an online supplement (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/47/605/mmedia">http://stacks.iop.org/0026-1394/47/605/mmedia</ext-link>).</p>'
