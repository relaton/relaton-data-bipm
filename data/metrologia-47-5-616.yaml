  content: "<p>We investigate some statistical properties of ac voltages from a white
    noise source measured with a digital lock-in amplifier equipped with finite impulse
    response output filters which introduce correlations between successive voltage
    values. The main goal of this work is to propose simple solutions to account for
    correlations when calculating the standard deviation of the mean (SDM) for a sequence
    of measurement data acquired using such an instrument. The problem is treated
    by time series analysis based on a moving average model of the filtering process.
    Theoretical expressions are derived for the power spectral density (PSD), the
    autocorrelation function, the equivalent noise bandwidth and the Allan variance;
    all are related to the SDM. At most three parameters suffice to specify any of
    the above quantities: the filter time constant, the time between successive measurements
    (both set by the lock-in operator) and the PSD of the white noise input, <italic>h</italic><sub>0</sub>.
    Our white noise source is a resistor so that the PSD is easily calculated; there
    are no free parameters. Theoretical expressions are checked against their respective
    sample estimates and, with the exception of two of the bandwidth estimates, agreement
    to within 11% or better is found.</p>"
