abstract:
- content: "<p>We present the experimental results of extremely precise timing in
    the sense of time-of-arrival measurements in a local time scale. The timing device
    designed and constructed in our laboratory is based on a new concept using a surface
    acoustic wave filter as a time interpolator. Construction of the device is briefly
    described. The experiments described were focused on evaluating the timing precision
    and stability. Low-jitter test pulses with a repetition frequency of 763 Hz were
    generated synchronously to the local time base and their times of arrival were
    measured. The resulting precision of a single measurement was typically 900 fs
    RMS, and a timing stability TDEV of 4 fs was achieved for time intervals in the
    range from 300 s to 2 h. To our knowledge this is the best value reported to date
    for the stability of a timing device. The experimental results are discussed and
    possible improvements are proposed.</p>"
