abstract:
- content: "<p>The metrological fields of photometry and radiometry and their associated
    units are closely linked through the current definition of the base unit of luminous
    intensity—the candela. These fields are important to a wide range of applications
    requiring precise and accurate measurements of electromagnetic radiation and,
    in particular, the amount of radiant energy (light) that is perceived by the human
    eye. The candela has been one of the base units since the inception of the International
    System of Units (SI) and is the only base unit that quantifies a fundamental biological
    process—human vision. This photobiological process spans an enormous dynamic range
    of light levels from a few-photon interaction involved in triggering the vision
    mechanism to a level of more than 10<sup>15</sup> photons per second that is accommodated
    by the visual response under bright daylight conditions. This position paper,
    prepared by members of the Task Group on the SI of the Consultative Committee
    for Photometry and Radiometry Strategic Planning Working Group (CCPR WG-SP), reviews
    the evolution of these fields of optical radiation measurements and their consequent
    impact on definitions and realization of the candela. Over the past several decades,
    there have been significant developments in sources, detectors, measuring instruments
    and techniques, that have improved the measurement of photometric and radiometric
    quantities for classical applications in lighting design, manufacturing and quality
    control processes involving optical sources, detectors and materials. These improved
    realizations largely underpin the present (1979) definition of the candela. There
    is no consensus on whether this radiant-based definition fully satisfies the current
    and projected needs of the optical radiation community. There is also no consensus
    on whether a reformulation of the definition of the candela in terms of photon
    flux will be applicable to the lighting community. However, there have been significant
    recent advances in radiometry in the development of single-photon sources and
    single-photon detectors and the growth of associated technologies, such as quantum
    computing and quantum cryptography. The international acceptance of these new
    quantum-based technologies requires improved traceability and reliability of measurements
    at the level of a few photons. This review of the evolution of the candela and
    the impact of its possible reformulation might lead, in the future, to a reformulation
    in terms of quantum units (photons). This discussion is timely since redefinitions
    of four of the other SI base units are being considered now in terms of fundamental
    constants to provide a more universally realizable quantum-based SI system. This
    paper also introduces for the first time a fundamental constant for photometry.</p>"
