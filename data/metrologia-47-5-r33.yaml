abstract:
- content: "<p>The spectral radiant intensity of synchrotron radiation from electron
    storage rings can be calculated from basic electrodynamic relations (Schwinger
    equation) and it is directly proportional to the stored electron beam current,
    i.e. the number of stored electrons. With the necessary equipment installed to
    measure and control the electron beam current over a wide dynamic range, the radiant
    intensity of the synchrotron radiation can be adjusted accordingly without changing
    the spectrum.</p><p>This is done, e.g., at the Metrology Light Source (MLS), the
    dedicated electron storage ring of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt.
    The MLS is operated as a primary radiation source standard from the near IR up
    to the soft x-ray region and its operational parameters can be adjusted and accurately
    measured in a wide range: the electron beam current can be varied from 1 pA (one
    stored electron) up to 200 mA and thus the radiant intensity can be changed by
    more than 11 decades. The photon flux or radiant power for typical angular acceptances
    can thus be varied from single photons to milliwatts. This is a very powerful
    tool, e.g., for the characterization of the linearity of the response of radiation
    detectors or for the calibration of photon counting detectors. In this article
    we present an overview of past, current and possible future activities exploiting
    this feature.</p>"
