abstract:
- content: "<p>As a single working chamber for a national air kerma standard was not
    considered safe and robust enough, a new set of six ionization chambers was devised
    to establish the French<sup>60</sup>Co air kerma standard. Although every new
    ionization chamber was treated as much as possible in the same way (manufacturing,
    measurements of volumes, wall effect calculations, current corrections), a maximum
    discrepancy of 0.2% was observed between the final measurement results from each
    chamber. The final value of the air kerma rate in reference conditions was determined
    as the mean value of the measurement results from all six chambers. Among the
    different factors whose determination is necessary to calculate the air kerma
    rate, some are considered independent of or common to all the graphite-walled
    ionization chambers (example: mean energy expended by an electron to produce an
    ion pair in dry air), while others vary for each chamber (example: air cavity
    ionic collection volume). Considering that the uncertainties of the individual
    ionization chamber measurement results seem slightly underestimated, the uncertainty
    on the mean of the products of the six chamber-dependent factors was taken equal
    to the standard deviation of the sample composed of the products of the six chamber-dependent
    factors (0.078%). Compared with the previous standard, the air kerma rate of the<sup>60</sup>Co
    photon beam would then increase by 0.09% and the air kerma rate uncertainty would
    drop from 0.38% to 0.31%.</p>"
