abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique that is widely
    used to obtain information about protein structure, and hence is an important
    tool with many applications, including the characterization of biopharmaceuticals.
    A previous inter-laboratory study, CCQM-P59, showed that there was a poor level
    of comparability between laboratories in CD spectroscopy. In a follow-up study
    reported here, we achieved our goal of demonstrating improved comparability and
    data quality, primarily by addressing the problems identified in the previous
    study, which included cell path-length measurement, instrument calibration and
    good practice in general. Multivariate analysis techniques (principal component
    analysis and soft independent modelling of class analogies) were shown to be useful
    in comparing large spectral data sets and in classifying spectra. However, our
    results also show that there is more work to be done to improve confidence in
    the technique as the discrepancies observed were partially due to systematic effects,
    which the statistical approaches do not consider. We therefore conclude that there
    is a need for an improved understanding of the uncertainties in CD measurement.</p>"
