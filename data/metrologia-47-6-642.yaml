abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we review statistical models that describe measurements
    from a multiple-method study such as in the development of a reference material.
    We also review requirements for the so-called GUM compliance, as this appears
    to be an important criterion for choosing a model and a method for assigning a
    value to a measurand of interest and calculating its uncertainty. For each modelling
    approach, we identify groups of competing methods and evaluate their status with
    respect to their statistical characteristics and GUM compliance.</p>"
