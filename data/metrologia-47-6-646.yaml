abstract:
- content: "<p>Surface temperatures are key parameters in many concentrated solar
    radiation applications. Pyrometric temperature measurement of solar irradiated
    material surfaces is the alternative to contact measurement techniques, which
    are inadequate for measuring the temperatures of such surfaces. However, reflected
    solar radiation is an important uncertainty variable in this non-contact methodology.
    A promising method for eliminating this solar perturbation is by using centred
    passband filters on the atmospheric solar absorption bands, creating solar-blind
    pyrometric systems. A commercial pyrometer has been tested in the wavelength band
    at around 1.4 µm in the solar furnace at Plataforma Solar de Almería, showing
    its advantages and limitations. An estimation of temperature measurement uncertainty
    for a real case is presented with theory and experiment in agreement: the higher
    the temperature, the lower the uncertainty. Another experiment has shown that
    the pyrometer measures temperature properly even through quartz windows in this
    spectral range.</p>"
