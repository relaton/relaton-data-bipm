  content: "<p>Watt balance experiments are intended to link the mass unit to the
    Planck constant. Therefore, in these experiments, a reference mass standard is
    necessary. However, in the French apparatus, the platinum–iridium alloy that forms
    the international prototype of the kilogram cannot be considered because of its
    magnetic susceptibility. Consequently, new materials were investigated, according
    to stringent specifications. This led to the selection of alloys based on precious
    metals. The stability of the materials used in mass metrology is strongly dependent
    on bulk homogeneity and cleanliness: after the investigation of different production
    modes and heating treatments, microstructural and analytical studies were performed.
    The critical properties of the different materials were examined and discussed
    in comparison with the platinum–iridium alloy.</p>"
