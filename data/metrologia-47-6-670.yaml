  content: "<p>The SI unit of mass will probably be redefined within the next few
    years using an invariable natural constant. Nevertheless, dissemination of the
    kilogram will still be realized by weighing using physical weights prone to contamination.
    Published data on cleaning, humidity effects and long term stability of weights
    show large discrepancies, indicating that not all factors affecting adsorption
    characteristics of weights are known. In the work reported here, an atomic force
    microscope (AFM) was used to study surface effects of stainless steel weights
    at the nanometre scale. Effects of transfer between air and vacuum as well as
    effects of cleaning were studied by recording topography images of the surface
    before and after each procedure. An image processing method was developed for
    improving the sensitivity of detecting changes in images. Ultrasonic cleaning
    in ethanol removed contamination mainly from the grooves in the surface, while
    vacuum exposure caused contamination to build up in the grooves. The results show
    that the surface microstructure of stainless steel weights affects adsorption
    of contaminants in such a way that grooves seem to be preferential sites for adsorption.
    AFM has proven to be a valuable tool for studying surface effects of standard
    weights at ambient pressure with near nanometre resolution.</p>"
