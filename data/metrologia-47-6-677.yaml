abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports results of comparison of three digital fringe signal
    processing methods implemented in the same free-fall absolute gravimeter. A two-sample
    zero-crossing method, a windowed second-difference method and a method of non-linear
    least-squares adjustment on the undersampled fringe signal are compared in numerical
    simulations, hardware tests and actual measurements with the MPG-2 absolute gravimeter,
    developed at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Germany. The two-sample
    zero-crossing method realizes data location schemes that are both equally spaced
    in distance and equally spaced in time (EST) along the free-fall trajectory. The
    windowed second-difference method and the method of non-linear least-squares adjustment
    with complex heterodyne demodulation operate with the EST data. Results of the
    comparison verify an agreement of the three methods within one part in 10<sup>9</sup>
    of the measured gravity value, provided a common data location scheme is considered.</p>"
