  content: "<p>In this paper, the realization of an inductance scale from 1 µH to
    10 H for frequencies ranging between 50 Hz and 20 kHz is presented. The scale
    is realized directly from a series of resistance standards using a fully automated
    synchronous sampling system. A careful systematic characterization of the system
    shows that the lowest uncertainties, around 12 µH H<sup>−1</sup>, are obtained
    for inductances in the range from 10 mH to 100 mH at frequencies in the kilohertz
    range. This new measurement system, which was evaluated during an international
    comparison, provides a primary realization of the henry, traceable to the quantum
    Hall effect. An additional key feature of this system is its versatility. In addition
    to resistance–inductance (<italic>R</italic>–<italic>L</italic>) comparison, any
    kind of impedance can be compared: <italic>R</italic>–<italic>R</italic>, <italic>R</italic>–<italic>C</italic>,
    <italic>L</italic>–<italic>L</italic> or <italic>C</italic>–<italic>C</italic>,
    giving this sampling system a great potential for use in many laboratories around
    the world.</p>"
