abstract:
- content: "<p>We describe the dimensional characterization of copper quasisphere
    NPL-Cranfield 2. The quasisphere is assembled from two hemispheres such that the
    internal shape is a triaxial ellipsoid, the major axes of which have nominal radii
    62.000 mm, 62.031 mm and 62.062 mm. The artefact has been manufactured using diamond-turning
    technology and shows a deviation from design form of less than ±1 µm over most
    of its surface. Our characterization involves both coordinate measuring machine
    (CMM) experiments and microwave resonance spectroscopy.</p><p>We have sought to
    reduce the dimensional uncertainty below the maximum permissible error of the
    CMM by comparative measurements with silicon and Zerodur spheres of known volume.
    Using this technique we determined the equivalent radius with an uncertainty of
    u(k = 1) = 114 nm, a fractional uncertainty of 1.8 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>. Due
    to anisotropy of the probe response, we could only determine the eccentricities
    of the quasihemispheres with a fractional uncertainty of approximately 2%.</p><p>Our
    microwave characterization uses the TM<sub>11</sub> to TM<sub>18</sub> resonances.
    We find the equivalent radius inferred from analysis of these modes to be consistent
    within ±4 nm with an overall uncertainty u(k = 1) = 11 nm. We discuss corrections
    for surface conductivity, waveguide perturbations and dielectric surface layers.</p><p>We
    find that the CMM radius estimates derived from each hemisphere cannot be used
    to accurately predict the equivalent radius of the assembled resonator for two
    reasons. Firstly, the equatorial flanges are flat only to within ±1 µm, leading
    to an equatorial ‘gap’ whose dimension cannot be reliably estimated. Secondly,
    the resonator undergoes significant elastic distortion when the bolts connecting
    the hemispheres are tightened. We provide CMM and microwave measurements to support
    these conclusions in addition to finite-element modelling.</p><p>Finally, we consider
    the implications of this work on a forthcoming experiment to determine the Boltzmann
    constant with a relative uncertainty below 1 part in 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>"
