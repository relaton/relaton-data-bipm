  script: Latn
  content: "<p>On the Laser Integration Line (LIL) facility at Commissariat à l'Energie
    Atomique (CEA) near Bordeaux (France), streak cameras (SCs) are extensively used
    as x-ray detectors by plasma physicists for the recording of transient phenomena
    as short as 100 ps. For proper interpretation of the experimental results measurements
    of the SC yield are carried out before each experimental campaign. The yield is
    actually an indirect measurement that depends on several other measured quantities.
    The uncertainty associated with the yield is evaluated using the analytical GUM
    approach and the Monte Carlo (MC) approach using GUM Supplement 1. It is shown
    in particular that in the assessment process the standard uncertainty and the
    probability density function of some input quantities propagate through polynomial
    fitting functions and integrals. A sensitivity analysis is also performed to identify
    the critical input quantities. The study shows that after correction of the manufacturer's
    fact sheet the GUM evaluation converges to MC evaluation when the uncertainties
    associated with non-linear input quantities become small. When propagating uncertainties
    through integrals it is observed that the uncertainty of the output quantity is
    mainly dominated by strong correlation effects with the covariance components
    adding up to produce large uncertainties. Finally, by comparing the experimental
    yield with a theoretical model good agreement is found.</p>"
