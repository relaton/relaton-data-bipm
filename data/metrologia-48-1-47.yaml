abstract:
- content: "<p>Alternating current measurements of double-shielded quantum Hall devices
    have revealed a fascinating property of which only a quantum effect is capable:
    it can detect its own frequency dependence and convert it to a current dependence
    which can be used to eliminate both of them. According to an experimentally verified
    model, the residual frequency dependence is smaller than the measuring uncertainty
    of 1.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup> kHz<sup>−1</sup>. In this way, a highly precise quantum
    standard of impedance can be established, without having to correct for any calculated
    frequency dependence and without the need for any artefact with a calculated frequency
    dependence. Nothing else like that is known to us and we hope that our results
    encourage other national metrology institutes to also apply it to impedance metrology
    and further explore its beautiful properties.</p>"
