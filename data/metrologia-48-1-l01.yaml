abstract:
- content: "<p>The rate of outgassing of water vapour from metal tubing and spheres
    is estimated and formulae given for the expected amount fraction of water added
    to otherwise pure gases. The relevance of these estimates to current efforts to
    redetermine the Boltzmann constant with relative uncertainty of measurement  u<sub>R</sub>(
    k<sub>B</sub>) ≈ 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> is supported with experimental results using
    trace moisture sensors and combined acoustic and microwave resonators. The outgassing
    does not represent an insuperable obstacle to accurate determinations of the Boltzmann
    constant in any of the current experiments. However, all workers in this field
    need to evaluate the extent of outgassing and devise a strategy for estimating
    and minimizing its effect.</p>"
