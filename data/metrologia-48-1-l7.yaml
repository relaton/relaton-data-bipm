  content: "<p>The Bayesian analysis of a simple calibration model is reconsidered.
    Observed values are at hand that conform to a Gaussian probability distribution
    of unknown standard deviation <italic>S</italic>. The mean of this distribution
    is given by a polynomial function of the measurand <italic>Y</italic>. For the
    coefficients <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> of this polynomial a state-of-knowledge
    distribution is available, whereas no prior information about <italic>Y</italic>
    and <italic>S</italic> exists. A conditional reference prior for (<italic>Y</italic>,
    <italic>S</italic>) given <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> is derived. It shows
    no functional dependence on the measurand in the case that the calibration function
    is linear, but depends non-trivially on the measurand otherwise. This prior is
    compared with other priors that have been used in the literature to analyse the
    same calibration model. It leads to a different posterior distribution than the
    application of Supplement 1 to the ‘<italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement</italic>’. An example illustrates differences of results founded
    on the various non-informative priors.</p>"
