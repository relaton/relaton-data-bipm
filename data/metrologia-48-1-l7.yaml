abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bayesian analysis of a simple calibration model is reconsidered.
    Observed values are at hand that conform to a Gaussian probability distribution
    of unknown standard deviation S. The mean of this distribution is given by a polynomial
    function of the measurand Y. For the coefficients P of this polynomial a state-of-knowledge
    distribution is available, whereas no prior information about Y and S exists.
    A conditional reference prior for (Y, S) given P is derived. It shows no functional
    dependence on the measurand in the case that the calibration function is linear,
    but depends non-trivially on the measurand otherwise. This prior is compared with
    other priors that have been used in the literature to analyse the same calibration
    model. It leads to a different posterior distribution than the application of
    Supplement 1 to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’. An
    example illustrates differences of results founded on the various non-informative
    priors.</p>"
