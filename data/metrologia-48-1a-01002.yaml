    <p>This report describes the results obtained from a GUM(Poland)–BIPM bilateral comparison of 10 kΩ resistance standards in 2009–2010. The comparison was carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.b. Two BIPM 10 kΩ travelling standards of SR104 type were calibrated first at the BIPM, then at the GUM and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability of the transfer standards was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer was smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations. The GUM and the BIPM calibrations were found to be in agreement, with a mean difference smaller than the expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
