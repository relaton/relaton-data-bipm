    <p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison on current transformer measurements between BIM (Bulgarian Institute of Metrology) and UME (TÜBÍTAK Ulusal Metroloji Enstitüsü/NMI of Turkey). The current ratios between 5 A/5 A and 1000 A/5 A were measured at a frequency of 50 Hz with a burden of 5 VA at unity power factor and with different percentage of rated current.</p>
    <p>The main objective of the comparison was to demonstrate equivalence of metrological practice and to check the correctness of the calibration results. The results of the measurements showed a good agreement between BIM and UME both for the ratio errors and for phase displacements.</p>
