    <p>The quantity to be measured was the effective efficiency of a type N thermistor mount, supplied by EIM. The calibration frequencies were 50 MHz, 1 GHz, 4 GHz, 8 GHz, 12 GHz, 15 GHz and 18 GHz. The measurements were carried out by all participants using a symmetrical twin-type microcalorimeter.</p>
    <p>The results show good agreement among the participants up to a frequency of 12 GHz. For the measurement points at 15 GHz and 18 GHz, the scatter of the results is not consistent with the claimed uncertainties. Further studies are necessary to explain the reason for this discrepancy.</p>
