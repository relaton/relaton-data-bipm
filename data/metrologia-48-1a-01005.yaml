    <p>This report presents the results of an international comparison of electric field strength in the frequency range (1 to 2.5) GHz which has been carried out among ten laboratories. As the travelling standard a measuring system with a small linearly polarized  <italic>E</italic>-field sensor was used. The parameter compared was the field strength appropriate for the circulated field strength meter indication of 20 V m<sup>−1</sup>. Basically, four types of calculable field strength realizations were used (rectangular waveguide, small TEM cell, reference transmitting antenna, reference receiving antenna). Some of the reported values obtained in anechoic chambers by using reference transmitting antennas ('standard field method') and in TEM cells are inconsistent with the claimed uncertainties.</p>
