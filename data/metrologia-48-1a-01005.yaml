abstract:
- content: "<p>This report presents the results of an international comparison of
    electric field strength in the frequency range (1 to 2.5) GHz which has been carried
    out among ten laboratories. As the travelling standard a measuring system with
    a small linearly polarized   E -field sensor was used. The parameter compared
    was the field strength appropriate for the circulated field strength meter indication
    of 20 V m<sup>−1</sup>. Basically, four types of calculable field strength realizations
    were used (rectangular waveguide, small TEM cell, reference transmitting antenna,
    reference receiving antenna). Some of the reported values obtained in anechoic
    chambers by using reference transmitting antennas ('standard field method') and
    in TEM cells are inconsistent with the claimed uncertainties.</p><p> Main text.
