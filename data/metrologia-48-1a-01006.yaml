    <p>A comparison of the 10 V and 1 V Josephson array voltage standards of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with those of the National Metrology Centre (NMC), A*STAR, Singapore, in September 2010. For this exercise, option B of the comparison protocol was applied for the two voltages. The BIPM provided a reference voltage for measurement by the NMC, A*STAR using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device (option B of the comparison protocol). The BIPM array is floating from ground.</p>
    <p>The final results are in very good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 9.6 parts in 10<sup>11</sup> and 0.9 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> for the nominal voltages of 10 V and 1.018 V respectively.</p>
