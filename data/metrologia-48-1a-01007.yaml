    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), Russian Federation, in November 2010. For this exercise, option A of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol was applied. This option required the VNIIM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the BIPM using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. The BIPM array is kept floating from ground.</p>
    <p>The final results are in very good agreement with the combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.0 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p>
