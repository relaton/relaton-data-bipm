abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), Russian Federation, in November 2010. For this exercise, option A of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol was applied. This option required the VNIIM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the BIPM using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. The BIPM array is kept floating from ground.</p><p>The final results are in very good agreement with the combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.0 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
