    <p>A EUROMET trilateral comparison of a 10 mH inductance standard at a frequency of 1 kHz took place in 2006. The participants were PTB (Germany), INM (Romania) and NCM (Bulgaria)—NCM is now BIM, Bulgarian Institute of Metrology.</p><p>The result of PTB was taken as the comparison reference value because the uncertainty of the PTB result was about ten times smaller than the other two. Although the methods of measurement differed in all participating laboratories, an agreement within the respective limits of uncertainty could be achieved by all participants.</p><p>The participation of PTB made it possible to have a link to the key comparison CCEM-K3. The results of each participant are thus also referred to the key comparison reference value stated in the CCEM-K3 final report.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
