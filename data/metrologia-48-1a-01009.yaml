    <p>To support the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) declared by members of EURAMET (formerly EUROMET) in the framework of the CIPM-MRA, a EURAMET key comparison was organized. Electrical standards of low-frequency (50/60 Hz) power were compared at ten national metrology institutes (NMIs) of EURAMET member states and at two NMIs of COOMET and APMP member states, to establish the relationship between the electrical units of AC power at these laboratories. The results of this comparison are described. The differences between the values of almost all laboratories and the EURAMET reference values were within the expanded measurement uncertainties at a coverage factor  k = 2.</p><p>The link between the comparisons of 50/60 Hz power conducted by the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM) from 1996 to 2000 (CCEM-K5) and by EURAMET from 2003 to 2008 (EUROMET.EM-K5.1, Project no 687) is carried out following the example given by F Delahaye and T J Witt, in a similar way as in the previous comparison  EUROMET.EM-K5, Project no 385.</p><p>Main text.
