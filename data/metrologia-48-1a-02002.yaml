abstract:
- content: "<p>The EUROMET-PR-K6 key comparison on spectral regular transmittance
    was carried out in the framework of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement by 17 laboratories:
    BEV (Austria), CMI (Czech Republic), GUM (Poland), IFA (Spain), INM (Romania),
    INRIM (Italy), IPQ (Portugal), LNE–INM (France), METAS (Switzerland), MKEH (Hungary),
    MIKES (Finland), NPL (United Kingdom), PTB (Germany), SMU (Slovakia), SP (Sweden),
    UME (Turkey), VSL (The Netherlands), with the LNE–INM acting as the central and
    reporting laboratory. The link to CCPR-K6 is ensured by six link laboratories
    (IFA, LNE–INM, MIKES, NPL, PTB, SMU)</p><p>The aim of the comparison was restricted
    to checking the accuracy of the radiometric scale of spectrophotometers, using
    coloured glass filters with nominal transmittance of approximately 92%, 56%, 10%,
    1% and 0.1%. The wavelengths of measurement were 380 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm,
    700 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm and 1000 nm. The comparison was a star type comparison
    with the samples provided by the pilot laboratory and sent out to all the participants
    at the same time.</p><p>The report describes in detail the measurements made at
    the LNE–INM and summarizes the reports submitted by the participants. The comparison
    of the results of measurements carried out by the pilot laboratory before and
    after the circulation of the filters points out that the stability of most of
    the filters was rather poor. Moreover, for the coloured glass filters (filters
    B to E), the drift was wavelength dependent. As a consequence, for many results,
    the uncertainty due to the drift of the filters during the comparison is the major
    cause of uncertainties, much larger than the measurement uncertainty of the measurements
    reported by the laboratories.</p><p>Measurement results from participants and
    their associated uncertainties were analysed in this report according to the Guidelines
    for CCPR Comparison Report Preparation but with some adjustment for taking into
    account that transmittance measurements have unit 1. Across the spectral region
    (380 nm to 1000 nm) there were eight wavelengths at which a comparison was made.
    These were treated entirely independently and thus the report describes eight
    comparisons for each type of filter.</p><p>The linkage of this RMO key comparison
    to the CCPR-K6 key comparison takes a particularly simple form because (a) the
    pilot laboratory was also the pilot laboratory for the CCPR-K6 comparison and
    (b) the five other laboratories serving as links between the two contributed the
    same measurements on the same artefacts in each comparison. It follows from (a)
    and (b) that the same result is obtained by linking through any one of these five
    laboratories or any combination of them. The degrees of equivalence of participants
    in this RMO key comparison have hence been evaluated by linking through values
    measured by the pilot laboratory. Because the CCPR KCRV is defined relative to
    the values obtained by the pilot laboratory and the Δ<sub>X,i</sub> (the difference
    between participant measurement and the pilot laboratory measurement) are also
    defined relative to measurements by the same pilot laboratory, the unilateral
    degree of equivalence D<sub>i</sub> of the national metrological institute i takes
    the simple form: \n D<sub>i</sub> = Δ<sub>i</sub> − Δ<sub>KCRV</sub> \n U<sub>i</sub>
    = k[u<sup>2</sup>(Δ<sub>i</sub>) + u<sup>2</sup>(Δ<sub>KCRV</sub>)]<sup>1/2</sup>;
           k = 2.</p><p>All the results and a graphical representation of the unilateral
    degrees of equivalence with k = 2 are proposed in the final report.</p><p>Main

    publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
