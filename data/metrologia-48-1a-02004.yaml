    <p>The APMP.PR-S4 comparison of fiber optic power responsivity and nonlinearity at 1550 nm, from 1 mW to 250 mW, was carried out. In total three institutes participated: NMIJ (Japan), PTB (Germany) and NPL (United Kingdom). The measurements started in December 2008 and ended in December 2009.</p><p>For fiber optic power responsivity, all participants reported their results and all results were used for the intercomparison: no measurement was subject to rejection. For nonlinearity two participants reported their results, therefore only a bilateral comparison was performed.</p><p>The analysis method was carried out according to the Guidelines for CCPR Comparison Report Preparation and has been accepted by all participants. The reference value of fiber optic power responsivity was calculated using all participants' results. For fiber optic power from 10 mW to 250 mW all participants had unilateral DoE values consistent with their uncertainties at the k = 2 level. For fiber optic power of 1 mW all participants achieved consistency at the k = 3 level. For nonlinearity, the consistency of the measurements at both NMIJ and PTB was achieved with uncertainty at the k = 2 level.</p><p>Main text.
