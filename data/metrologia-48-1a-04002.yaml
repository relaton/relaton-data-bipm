    <p>The COOMET.L-S3 comparison of high-accuracy gauge block interferometers at nominal value 100 mm is a supplementary COOMET comparison between the national metrology institutes of Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The measurements were carried out between June and August 2010.</p>
    <p>The results obtained using a steel gauge block as well as a quartz gauge block show that the differences of values obtained by both laboratories do not exceed the estimated expanded uncertainties, which confirms a good degree of equivalence between the installations that were compared.</p>
