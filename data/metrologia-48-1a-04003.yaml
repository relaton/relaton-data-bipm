    <p>The COOMET project No 277/UA/03 'Comparison of comparators with photoelectric microscopes' was organized by COOMET and conducted between Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan from October 2008 to September 2010. NSC 'Institute of Metrology', Kharkov, Ukraine, acted as the pilot laboratory.</p>
    <p>This comparison is a supplementary one and allows the determination of the degrees of equivalence of the standards and the gauge-measurement capabilities of national metrological centers of the involved countries. Participants used their national comparator with photoelectric microscopes.</p>
    <p>A line standard of type MS 38-02-1000 (factory No 0315-90), made of 'invarstabil' 58% Ni, was used as the artifact of the comparison. It is an H-shaped line standard with a main nominal length of 1000 mm and an interval length of 1 mm. The width of the strokes of the scale, marked on the neutral surface, is approximately 5 Âµm and two longitudinal axial lines spaced by 2 mm are also marked.</p>
    <p>Based on the data presented in the final report, we can conclude that the discrepancy between the results of measurements of the artifact by the participating laboratories is within the corresponding expanded uncertainty, which indicates satisfactory degrees of equivalence of national comparators with photoelectric microscopes of the participating countries.</p>
