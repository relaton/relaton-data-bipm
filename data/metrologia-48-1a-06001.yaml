    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), Russian Federation, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the  <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2009. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficient for a transfer standard and expressed as a ratio of the VNIIM and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0008 with a combined standard uncertainty of 1.8 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
    <p>The degrees of equivalence between the VNIIM and the other participants in this BIPM.RI(I)-K1 key comparison have been calculated and the results are presented in the form of a matrix. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
