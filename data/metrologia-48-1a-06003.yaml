    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), Russian Federation, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2009. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficient for one transfer standard and expressed as a ratio of the VNIIM and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0013 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.</p><p>Main text.
