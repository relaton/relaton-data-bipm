    <p>In 2008, to update their previous result of 1999, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) submitted a new sample of  <sup>88</sup>Y with an activity of about 3.8 MBq to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). This comparison has the identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Y-88. The degree of equivalence between the equivalent activity measured in the SIR for the new PTB sample and the updated key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been calculated, as have the degrees of equivalence with each of the other participants. The results are given in the form of a matrix and a graphical presentation is also given.</p>
