    <p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the  <sup>60</sup>Co γ-ray reference beam of the BIPM in November to December 2009 under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the NMIJ and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9960(46). The degrees of equivalence between the NMIJ and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix for the ten national metrology institutes (NMIs) that have participated. A graphical presentation is also given. </p>
