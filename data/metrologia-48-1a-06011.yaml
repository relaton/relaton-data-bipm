- content: |-
    <p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the PTB and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the combined standard uncertainty of 3.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. A comparison of the standards has also been made in simulated mammography x-ray beams. The standards agree at the level of the combined standard uncertainty of 3.5 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.
