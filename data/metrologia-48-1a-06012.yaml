    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NMIJ, Japan and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in general agreement at the level of two standard uncertainties (6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>). A significant trend is evident in the results for the different radiation qualities and consistency with measurements made in 2001 for an APMP comparison is not as expected. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
