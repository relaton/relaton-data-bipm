    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the LNE–LNHB, France and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 1.6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>, with no evidence of a trend in the results at different radiation qualities. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
