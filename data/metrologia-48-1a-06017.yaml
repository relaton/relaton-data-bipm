- content: |-
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the MKEH, Hungary and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the standard uncertainty for the comparison of 3.4 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. No significant trend is observed in the results for the different radiation qualities. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
