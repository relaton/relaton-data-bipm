    <p>Section III (neutron measurements) of the Comité Consultatif des Rayonnements Ionisants, CCRI, conducted a key comparison of primary measurements of the neutron emission rate of an  <sup>241</sup>Am–Be(α,n) radionuclide source. A single  <sup>241</sup>Am–Be(α,n) source was circulated to all the participants between 1999 and 2005. Eight laboratories participated—the CIAE (China), CMI (Czech Republic), KRISS (Republic of Korea), LNMRI (Brazil), LNE–LNHB (France), NIST (USA), NPL (UK) and the VNIIM (Russian Federation)—with the NPL making their measurements at the start and repeating them near the end of the exercise to verify the stability of the source. Each laboratory reported the emission rate into 4π sr together with a detailed uncertainty budget. All participants used the manganese bath technique, with the VNIIM also making measurements using an associated particle technique. The CMI, KRISS, VNIIM, and later the NPL, also measured the anisotropy of the source although this was not a formal part of the comparison. The first draft report was released in May 2006 and having been discussed and modified by the participants and subsequently reviewed by the CCRI(III), the present paper is now the final report of the comparison.</p>
