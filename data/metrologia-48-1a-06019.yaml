- content: |-
    <p>The recent results of activity measurements of the radionuclide<sup>139</sup>Ce by the PTB, Germany and the BEV, Austria have been included in the BIPM key comparison database through their participation in the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ce-139 comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. The activities were about 4 MBq and 0.5 MBq, respectively. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the updated KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table and graph, together with those of the previous participants.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>
