- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of the dosimetry for accelerator photon beams was carried out between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in March 2010. The comparison was based on the determination of absorbed dose to water for three radiation qualities at the PTB. The comparison result, reported as a ratio of the PTB and the BIPM evaluations, is 1.001 at 6 MV (with a combined standard uncertainty u<sub>c</sub> of 5 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>), 1.003 at 10 MV (u<sub>c</sub> of 6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>) and 1.002 at 25 MV (u<sub>c</sub> of 6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>). This result is the second in the ongoing BIPM.RI(I)-K6 series of comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
