abstract:
- content: "<p>This report presents the results of a key comparison of liquid volume
    measurement conducted between ten participating institutes during the period July
    2006 to August 2008 within the framework of the Asia Pacifica Metrology Program
    (APMP). The transfer standards comprised one 20 L volume measure and two 100 mL
    glass pycnometers. These transfer standards had been used in a similar CIPM key
    comparison   CCM.FF-K4  in 2003 to 2005. The pilot institute was the National
    Measurement Institute, Australia (NMIA), which together with CENAM act as link
    laboratories to the CCM.FF-K4 comparison.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main
