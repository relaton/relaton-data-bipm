    <p>This report presents the results of a key comparison of liquid volume measurement conducted between ten participating institutes during the period July 2006 to August 2008 within the framework of the Asia Pacifica Metrology Program (APMP). The transfer standards comprised one 20 L volume measure and two 100 mL glass pycnometers. These transfer standards had been used in a similar CIPM key comparison  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/43/1A/07005">CCM.FF-K4</ext-link> in 2003 to 2005. The pilot institute was the National Measurement Institute, Australia (NMIA), which together with CENAM act as link laboratories to the CCM.FF-K4 comparison.</p>
