    <p>This report presents the results of a key comparison of low-pressure gas flow conducted between six participating institutes during the period January 2007 to August 2008 within the framework of the Asia Pacifica Metrology Program (APMP). A set of four critical flow venturis with dedicated, redundant pressure and temperature sensors was the transfer standard at flows between 4 g min<sup>−1</sup> and 183 g min<sup>−1</sup>. The pilot institute was the National Measurement Institute of Japan (NMIJ), which together with KRISS acted as link laboratories to the CCM.FF-K6 comparison.</p><p>Main text.
