    <p>This report presents the results of a key comparison of low-pressure gas flow conducted between six participating institutes during the period January 2007 to August 2008 within the framework of the Asia Pacifica Metrology Program (APMP). A set of four critical flow venturis with dedicated, redundant pressure and temperature sensors was the transfer standard at flows between 4 g min<sup>−1</sup> and 183 g min<sup>−1</sup>. The pilot institute was the National Measurement Institute of Japan (NMIJ), which together with KRISS acted as link laboratories to the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/44/1A/07008">CCM.FF-K6</ext-link> comparison.</p>
