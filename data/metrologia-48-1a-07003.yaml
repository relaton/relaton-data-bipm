    <p>The key comparison, APMP.M.FF-K1, was undertaken by APMP/TCFF, the Technical Committee for Fluid Flow (TCFF) under the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP). One objective of the key comparison was to demonstrate the degree of equivalence among six participating laboratories (KRISS, NMIJ, VMI, CMS, NIM and VNIIM) in water flow rate metrology by comparing the results with the key comparison reference value (KCRV) determined from the CCM.FF-K1 key comparison. The other objective of this key comparison was to provide supporting evidence for the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs), which had been declared by the participating laboratories during this key comparison. The Transfer Standard Package (TSP) was a Coriolis mass flowmeter, which had been used in the CCM.FF-K1 key comparison.</p><p>Because the K-factors in the APMP.M.FF-K1 key comparison were slightly lower than the K-factors of the CCM.FF-K1 key comparison due to long-term drifts of the TSP, a correction value D was introduced. The value of D was given by a weighted sum between two link laboratories (NMIJ and KRISS), which participated in both the CCM.FF-K1 and the APMP.M.FF-K1 key comparisons. By this correction, the K-factors were laid between 12.004 and 12.017 at either low (Re = 254 000) or high (Re = 561 000) flow rates.</p><p>Most of the calibration data were within expected uncertainty bounds. However, some data showed undulations, which gave large fluctuations of the metering factor at Re = 561 000. Calculation of degrees of equivalence showed that all the participating laboratories had deviations between −0.009 and 0.007 pulses/kg from the CCM.FF-K1 KCRV at either the low or the high flow rates. In case of En calculation, all the participating laboratories showed values less than 1, indicating that the corrected K-factors of all the laboratories were equivalent with the KCRV at both Re = 254 000 and 561 000. When the corrected K-factors from two participating laboratories were compared, all the numbers of equivalence showed values less than 1, indicating equivalence.</p><p>Main text.
