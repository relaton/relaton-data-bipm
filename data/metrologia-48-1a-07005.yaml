    <p>A comparison of sub-milligram mass standards was undertaken between NPL (as the pilot laboratory), LNE and PTB. The nominal values of the weights circulated were 500 micrograms, 200 micrograms and 100 micrograms. All participants demonstrated equivalence with the calculated reference values at the stated level of uncertainty, which was less than 0.2 micrograms for participants' results. However, it was noted that instability in the transfer standards was a significant factor in the comparison results and care needs to be taken in the transport and handling of such sub-milligram weights to ensure the success of future comparisons.</p><p>In addition to the sub-milligram weights, weights of nominal value 100 grams and 10 grams were circulated as a means to validate CMC data. All participants demonstrated equivalence to the calculated reference value for both transfer standards.</p><p>Main text.
