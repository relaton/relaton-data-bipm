    <p>A comparison of pressure measurements standards in the range 80 kPa to 7 MPa has been carried out between twelve national measurement institutes under the auspices of EURAMET. The results of this comparison, designated EUROMET.M.P-K3b, have been linked to those of a CCM comparison (CCM.P-K1.c), organized by the Consultative Committee for Mass (CCM), via two common participants. The results presented here demonstrate the metrological equivalence, within the quoted uncertainties, of all of the participant laboratories in this pressure range.</p>
