    <p>This report describes a bilateral comparison of 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg stainless steel mass standards between Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and National Physical Laboratory, India (NPLI), which is registered in the KCDB as APMP.M.M-K2.1. These nominal values were chosen as they followed the nominal values of  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/40/1A/07004">CCM.M-K2</ext-link>. This bilateral comparison was piloted by KRISS. The Measurement Standard Laboratory (MSL), New Zealand has provided a linkage analysis of this bilateral comparison to CCM.M-K2. The set of four weights was circulated between KRISS and NPLI laboratories in June 2010 and received back from the last participant in July 2010. NPLI has tried to improve their calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) for mass below 1 kg. KRISS participated in both this comparison and CCM.M-K2, providing the link between the NPLI results and the key comparison reference value of CCM.M-K2.</p>
