    <p>This report summarizes the results of the bilateral key comparison APMP.M.M-K1.1 between the National Measurement Institute of Australia (NMIA) and the National Metrology Centre, Agency for Science Technology &amp; Research (NMC, A*STAR) using a 1 kg stainless steel mass standard.</p>
    <p>The objective of the comparison is to demonstrate the metrological equivalence between the two laboratories. The results of the comparison will be used to support improved Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) declaration of NMC, A*STAR to fulfil the requirements of the CIPM MRA.</p>
    <p>The NMIA has taken part in both  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/41/1A/07002">CCM.M-K1</ext-link> and APMP.M.M-K1.1, and is the pilot and linking laboratory for this bilateral comparison. The comparison commenced on 29 September 2008 and was concluded on 15 December 2008. A stainless steel 1 kg OIML Class E1 standard mass was used as the travelling artefact and was transported between the laboratories by courier and by hand-carrying. The APMP.M.M.K2 technical protocol was adopted as the protocol for this comparison.</p>
    <p>The comparison results together with their assigned uncertainties show good agreement between NMIA and NMC, A*STAR and with the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of the CCM.M-K1. It also shows that NMC, A*STAR has the measurement capability at the OIML E1 level. The deviation from the KCRV of the CCM.M-K1 for NMC, A*STAR through this comparison is +0.033 mg with an uncertainty of 0.049 mg.</p>
