abstract:
- content: "<p>A differential pressure comparison was performed between CENAM (Mexico)
    and INTI (Argentina) by means of a liquid column manometer. The measuring range
    was 50 Pa to 500 Pa. CENAM calibrated the transfer standard at the beginning and
    at the end of the comparison. The transfer standard used was a Dwyer liquid column
    manometer model Microtector with an accuracy class of 0.013% of the reading. The
    compared pressure points were (50, 75, 125, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500)
    Pa. The uncertainty sources to be evaluated included at least the following: (a)
    uncertainty due to the standard used by the laboratory; (b) uncertainty due to
    repeatability; (c) uncertainty due to resolution; (d) uncertainty due to hysteresis;
    (e) uncertainty due to zero drift. The criteria used to compare the results obtained
    were the normalized error equation ( En ). The results obtained by the laboratories
    were compatible according to the criteria | En | ≤ 1.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach
