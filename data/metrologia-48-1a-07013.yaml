    <p>The results of a key comparison of ultra-high vacuum standards at two national metrology institutes (NMIJ/AIST and KRISS) are reported. This bilateral comparison was carried out from May 2010 to October 2010 within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) to determine their degrees of equivalence at pressures in the range from 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa to 9 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa. The pilot institute was NMIJ/AIST. Two spinning rotor gauges and two hot cathode ionization gauges were used as the transfer standards. NMIJ/AIST used two calibration systems: the dynamic expansion system (NMIJ-DES) and two-stage flow-dividing system (NMIJ-TFS). KRISS used the dynamic expansion system. The transfer standards were sufficiently stable to meet the requirements of the comparison compared with those of previous international comparisons owing to some improvements of the protocol and the transfer standards. The ultra-high vacuum standards of NMIJ/AIST and KRISS were found to be equivalent within their claimed uncertainties in the range from 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa to 9 × 10<sup>−5</sup> Pa. The NMIJ-DES results, which have smaller uncertainty than NMIJ-TFS, were transferred to the corresponding CCM key comparison, CCM.P-K3, in the range from 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa to 9 × 10<sup>−5</sup> Pa and it is shown that the NMIJ values were equivalent to the CCM key comparison reference value within the claimed uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.
