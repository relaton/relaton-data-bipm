abstract:
- content: "<p>Two national primary laboratories, CENAM (Mexico) and CEM (Spain),
    have compared the results of their pressure measurement capabilities by means
    of the calibration of a spinning rotor gauge (SRG) between 0.005 Pa and 1 Pa,
    and of a capacitance digital gauge (CDG) between 0.5 Pa and 100 Pa. The results
    of two calibrations made by CEM make it possible to conclude that the pressure
    transducers used for the comparison were appropriate for the purpose.</p><p>The
    conclusions of supplementary comparison EURAMET.M.P-S10 are that all measurements
    are consistent and that there is agreement between the laboratories in the range
    compared.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on   Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by EURAMET, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
