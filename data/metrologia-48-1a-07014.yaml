    <p>Two national primary laboratories, CENAM (Mexico) and CEM (Spain), have compared the results of their pressure measurement capabilities by means of the calibration of a spinning rotor gauge (SRG) between 0.005 Pa and 1 Pa, and of a capacitance digital gauge (CDG) between 0.5 Pa and 100 Pa. The results of two calibrations made by CEM make it possible to conclude that the pressure transducers used for the comparison were appropriate for the purpose.</p>
    <p>The conclusions of supplementary comparison EURAMET.M.P-S10 are that all measurements are consistent and that there is agreement between the laboratories in the range compared.</p>
