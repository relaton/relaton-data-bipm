    <p>The determination of mass fraction of toxic elements and especially platinum emitted from automobile catalytic converters in the air is a critical factor in assessing air quality and the potential impact of possible pollutants. Air is in fact one of the main pathways for human exposure to toxic elements. Biomonitors, such as lichen and algae, are examples of environmental samples that have been widely used by the scientific community to assess and monitor the level of environmental pollution. For this purpose, the IAEA-450 algae material containing heavy metals and platinum at low level was prepared by IAEA Seibersdorf Laboratories in collaboration with the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protectionâ€”ISPRA (former APAT). During the April meeting in 2009 of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of the CCQM it was agreed to organize a key comparison K75 for Pt and Ni and a parallel pilot study P118 for As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb and Pt using this algae material.</p>
    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K75 was successfully organized. The participating NMIs demonstrated a high level of measurement capabilities and technical competence in analysing nickel and platinum at a low level of concentration in environmental samples such as algae. The between-laboratories reproducibility standard deviation for nickel and platinum was 1.9% and 3.6% respectively, which reflects an excellent agreement of between-laboratories measurement results. The ratio between the bias and its expanded uncertainty for nickel and platinum was below 2.0 for all reported results except in one case. This study was a practical demonstration of a CCQM comparison to use the 'core-capabilities' utilized by participants as a mean of providing evidence for Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMC) claims for Ni and Pt.</p>
    <p>Based on this CCQM international key comparison, the measurement capability of the NMIs which participated in the CCQM-K75 has been demonstrated directly for determination of Pt and Ni in algae matrix. In addition, the NMIs demonstrated a wide range of 'core-capabilities' applicable to other measurement applications.</p>
