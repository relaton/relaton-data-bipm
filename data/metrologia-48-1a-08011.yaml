  content: "<p>This comparison 'Hg in natural water' was a follow-up to the pilot
    studies CCQM-P100.1 and CCQM-P100.2. The aim of this comparison was to demonstrate
    the capability of national metrology institutes to measure the Hg mass concentration
    in a natural water sample at the very low concentration level of γ(Hg) ≈ 70 ng/L
    as required by the EQS. In this way it served to help implement the European Water
    Framework Directive (WFD). This comparison was an activity of the Inorganic Analysis
    Working Group (IAWG) of CCQM and was piloted by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany) with the help of the co-organizers Bundesanstalt
    für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM, Berlin, Germany), Laboratoire National
    de Métrologie et d'Essais (LNE, Paris, France), and the Joint Research Centre–Institute
    for Reference Materials and Measurements (EC–JRC–IRMM, Geel, Belgium).</p>\n<p>The
    following laboratories participated in this key comparison (in alphabetical order):

    <list-item><p>SP (Sweden)</p></list-item>\n</list></p>\n<p>The majority of participants
    applied isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) using sector field or quadrupole
    inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) in combination with cold vapour (CV) generation
    as the analytical technique. NRC reported a combined result of ID-CV-ICP-MS and
    CV atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS). SP applied a standard addition method
    on a sector field ICP-MS, while BAM made use of an external 5-point calibration
    on a CV atomic fluorescence spectrometer (AFS). The key comparison reference value
    (KCRV) was agreed upon during the IAWG meeting in April 2010 at BIPM as the sum
    of the added Hg content calculated from the gravimetric sample preparation and
    the Hg matrix content of the water used for sample preparation (determined and
    validated on two independent pathways). Accordingly the degrees of equivalence
    were calculated.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this
