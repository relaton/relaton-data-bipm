    <p>Under the auspices of the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif
    pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a laboratory comparison, CCQM-P20.f, was coordinated
    by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in 2007/2008. Nine national
    measurement institutes, four expert laboratories and the BIPM participated in the comparison.
    Participants were required to assign the mass fraction of digoxin present as the main component
    in the comparison sample (CCQM-P20.f) which consisted of digoxin material obtained from a
    commercial supplier stated to comply with USP requirements.</p>
    <p>In addition to assigning the mass fraction content of digoxin for the material, participants were
    requested, but not obliged, to provide mass fraction estimates for the minor components they
    identified in each sample.</p>
    <p>In contrast with the previous round of the CCQM-P20 series, in which the mass fraction content
    of theophylline in two comparison samples (CCQM-P20.e.1 and CCQM-P20.e.2) was
    determined, a wider range of results were reported for the mass fraction content of digoxin in
    the CCQM-P20.f comparison.</p>
    <p>A minority of participants did not appear to use conditions capable of fully resolving and/or
    quantifying the major related structure impurities present in the comparison sample. Among
    those that did achieve suitable separations, there was further variation in their reported
    quantifications of the individual and total related substance content which reflected in part the
    limited availability of reference standards for these materials and the resulting assumptions that
    had to be made regarding the structure and response factors relative to digoxin for each
    individual impurity. This was particularly relevant because of the span of molecular masses of
    the impurities present in the sample, which ranged from aglycones to glycones with tetrameric
    carbohydrate chains, relative to that of digoxin.</p>
    <p>A significant additional factor also contributed to the observed variation of results. Unlike the
    CCQM-P20.e samples, in which the major impurities were solely related structure organic
    compounds, the CCQM-P20.f study material contained significant levels of residual organic
    solvents (ethanol, dichloromethane and to a lesser extent toluene). The majority of participants
    failed to detect and allow for the presence of this class of impurity, introducing a bias towards
    overestimation of digoxin content in most of the individual results.</p>
    <p>However, the uncertainty budgets produced by several participants were sufficiently
    conservative such that their reported results were nevertheless consistent with the reference
    value for digoxin content assigned using a consensus mass balance approach.
    The results of the comparison reinforce the conclusion from previous rounds of the CCQM-P20
    study that care in developing and validating the suitability of the chromatographic separation
    method used to resolve the main component from the related structure impurities present is
    essential to obtaining reliable, comparable results when using the mass balance approach to
    estimate purity.</p>
    <p>This specific comparison has demonstrated that, in addition to developing an appropriate
    chromatographic separation, it is also important to use complementary techniques capable of
    detecting all potential orthogonal classes of impurities if it is desired to demonstrate a general
    capability to assign purity with a small (&lt;0.2% relative) standard uncertainty.</p>
