abstract:
- content: "<p>The supplementary comparison APMP.QM-S3 has been carried out in parallel
    with APMP.QM-P12 to demonstrate and document the capability of NMIs in the APMP
    region for determination of Cd content of sub mg/kg level in rice and related
    food matrix materials. As an activity of the Technical Committee for Amount of
    Substance (TCQM) of the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP), it was coordinated
    by KRISS (Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Korea) with NIM (National
    Institute of Metrology, China) and NMIJ (National Metrology Institute of Japan,
    Japan) as co-coordination laboratories to provide a reference value. Seven national
    metrology institutes (NMIs) in the APMP participated in the supplementary comparison.</p><p>Four
    participants used double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-ICP/MS) for determination
    of Cd in rice, while the other two participants used graphite furnace-atomic absorption
    spectroscopy (GF-AAS) with either external calibration or standard addition. The
    degree of equivalence for results obtained with double ID-ICP/MS was satisfactory
    with less than 5% deviation from the reference value even in the worst case. Results
    from GF-AAS, however, exhibited significant discrepancies from the reference value,
    which indicate that the method employed requires improvements including rigorous
    control of parameters and method validation. The majority of the participating
    laboratories directly demonstrated their capability to measure cadmium in rice
    and will be able to apply such expertise to a range of samples and analytes with
    similar matrices.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click

    the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by APMP, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
