abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A bilateral comparison of pressure sensitivity calibration of an LS2P microphone has been performed between the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, Korea) and the Research and Development Center for Calibration Instrumentation and Metrology (KIM-LIPI, Indonesia), in 2008, with KRISS acting as the pilot laboratory. The results have been linked to the CCAUV.A-K3 comparison with degrees of equivalence for the KIM-LIPI.</p><p>Main text.
