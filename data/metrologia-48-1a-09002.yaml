    <p>A bilateral regional comparison of national microphone standards from 2 Hz to 250 Hz was carried out between the DP NDI 'Systema' (Ukraine) and the VNIIFTRI (Russia) from July to September 2009. The comparison, COOMET.AUV.A-K2, was based on the pressure calibration of laboratory standard microphones type LSIP. The comparison results have been linked to the established key comparison reference value (KCRV) of  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/46/1A/09006">CCAUV.A-K2</ext-link>. The degrees of equivalence, expressed as the deviation from the established KCRV and its expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2), have been determined, and the comparison result is in agreement with the KCRV within the estimated uncertainties at all employed frequencies.</p>
