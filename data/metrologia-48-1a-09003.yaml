    <p>This report describes the results obtained in a bilateral comparison of primary vibration calibration facilities. Two piezoelectric standard accelerometers (one single-ended as well one back-to-back type) were calibrated first at METAS, then at the PTB and again at METAS after their return.</p>
    <p>The METAS and the PTB calibrations were found to be in excellent agreement, with a mean difference smaller than the expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the comparison.</p>
