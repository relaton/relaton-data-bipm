    <p>This issue of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> collects papers about the results of an international research project aimed at the determination of the Avogadro constant,  <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>, by counting the atoms in a silicon crystal highly enriched with the isotope  <sup>28</sup>Si. Fifty years ago, Egidi [1] thought about realizing an atomic mass standard. In 1965, Bonse and Hart [2] operated the first x-ray interferometer, thus paving the way to the achievement of Egidi's dream, and soon Deslattes  <italic>et al</italic> [3] completed the first counting of the atoms in a natural silicon crystal.</p>
    <p>The present project, outlined by Zosi [4] in 1983, began in 2004 by combining the experiences and capabilities of the BIPM, INRIM, IRMM, NIST, NPL, NMIA, NMIJ and PTB. The start signal, ratified by a memorandum of understanding, was a contract for the production of a silicon crystal highly enriched with  <sup>28</sup>Si. The enrichment process was undertaken by the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building in St Petersburg. Subsequently, a polycrystal was grown in the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity Substances of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Nizhny Novgorod and a  <sup>28</sup>Si boule was grown and purified by the Leibniz-Institut für Kristallzüchtung in Berlin. Isotope enrichment made it possible to apply isotope dilution mass spectroscopy, to determine the Avogadro constant with unprecedented accuracy, and to fulfil Egidi's dream.</p>
    <p>To convey Egidi's 'fantasy' into practice, two  <sup>28</sup>Si kilogram prototypes shaped as quasi-perfect spheres were manufactured by the Australian Centre for Precision Optics; their isotopic composition, molar mass, mass, volume, density and lattice parameter were accurately determined and their surfaces were chemically and physically characterized at the atomic scale. The paper by Andreas  <italic>et al</italic> reviews the work carried out; it collates all the findings and illustrates how Avogadro's constant was obtained. Impurity concentration and gradients in the enriched crystal were measured by infrared spectroscopy and taken into account; Zakel  <italic>et al</italic> relate these measurements in detail. Next, Pramann  <italic>et al</italic> illustrate how the molar mass of the enriched crystal was measured by exploiting isotopic enrichment and isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Valkiers  <italic>et al</italic> report about remeasurement of the molar mass of a natural Si crystal, a measurement prompted by the exigency of clarifying the origin of the discrepancy between the  <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> value given in the present issue and the value obtained using natural Si crystals. A consistency analysis of the different isotopic-composition determinations is illustrated in the paper by Bulska  <italic>et al</italic>. As reported in two papers by Massa  <italic>et al</italic>, to determine the lattice parameter an x-ray interferometer was manufactured from the material between the already mentioned spheres. The measurement result was combined with lattice comparisons between different crystal samples and with the impurity gradient to extrapolate the sphere's lattice-parameter. Ferroglio  <italic>et al</italic>'s contribution analyzes the self-weight deformation of the x-ray interferometer. Fujimoto  <italic>et al</italic> report about the lattice-perfection investigations carried out by a novel self-referencing diffractometer at the National Laboratory for High-Energy Physics (KEK) in Japan. A really great effort was made to characterize the sphere surfaces and to correct for the oxide layer and the contaminating atoms. The results of these investigations are given by Busch  <italic>et al</italic>. The sphere diameter and topography were measured by optical interferometry to nanometer accuracy; the papers of Bartl  <italic>et al</italic> and Kuramoto  <italic>et al</italic> describe how the sphere volumes were determined. Andreas  <italic>et al</italic>'s paper describes the calculation of phase corrections for the diameter measurements. The results of mass comparisons against the Pt–Ir standards of the BIPM, NMIJ and PTB are given by Picard  <italic>et al</italic>.</p>
    <p>The results reported in the present issue need to be completed. One of the necessary activities is to relate the mass of the  <sup>28</sup>Si atom to its Compton wavelength to test the mass–energy–frequency equivalence. Another effort is to monitor the stability of the Pt–Ir prototype: the technologies described in the present issue can be refined and finalized to calculate the mass variation of 1 kg  <sup>28</sup>Si spheres by monitoring the surface evolution without weighing them on a balance. The last activity is the determination of the mass of a  <sup>28</sup>Si sphere by electrical measurements using a watt balance and without any reference to the Pt–Ir prototype. In this framework, it will be necessary to demonstrate the mutual consistency and the stability of both the electrical and crystal  <italic>mise en pratique</italic> of a kilogram definition based on a conventional value of the Planck constant. A related issue is to develop suitable procedures and protocols to disseminate the unit of mass from the new realizations.</p>
    <p>Since the molar Planck constant is well known via the measurement of the Rydberg constant, the accurate measurement of  <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> also provides an accurate and independent determination of the Planck constant,  <italic>h</italic>. A comparison of the values of the Planck constant obtained via the watt-balance experiment and the  <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> determination tests quantum mechanics. In fact, the watt-balance value of  <italic>h</italic> depends on solid state physics through the theories of Josephson and quantum Hall effects, whereas the value of  <italic>h</italic> derived from  <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> depends on atomic physics through the energy level differences in hydrogen and deuterium, whose associated transition frequencies yield information on the Rydberg constant.</p>
    <p>Grateful thanks are addressed to H-J Pohl for his outstanding project management in Russia, to A K Kaliteevski and his colleagues of the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building and the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity Substances for their dedication and the punctual delivery of the enriched material, to H Riemann and his staff of the Institut für Kristallzüchtung for the crystal growth, to our directors for their advice and financial support, and to our colleagues for their daily work.</p>
    <p>Special thanks are addressed to Peter Becker, to whom this issue is dedicated on the occasion of his retirement from work at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. In 1974, young Peter joined the PTB's Avogadro group which, under the direction of Peter Seyfried, followed Bonse's work and improved the measurements of the lattice parameter and the Avogadro constant [5, 6]. In 2004, Peter proposed and backed this project by taking on his shoulders the risks, the management burden and the coordination of the many relevant activities.</p>
