abstract:
- content: "<p>This issue of Metrologia collects papers about the results of an international
    research project aimed at the determination of the Avogadro constant, N<sub>A</sub>,
    by counting the atoms in a silicon crystal highly enriched with the isotope<sup>28</sup>Si.
    Fifty years ago, Egidi [1] thought about realizing an atomic mass standard. In
    1965, Bonse and Hart [2] operated the first x-ray interferometer, thus paving
    the way to the achievement of Egidi's dream, and soon Deslattes et al [3] completed
    the first counting of the atoms in a natural silicon crystal.</p><p>The present
    project, outlined by Zosi [4] in 1983, began in 2004 by combining the experiences
    and capabilities of the BIPM, INRIM, IRMM, NIST, NPL, NMIA, NMIJ and PTB. The
    start signal, ratified by a memorandum of understanding, was a contract for the
    production of a silicon crystal highly enriched with<sup>28</sup>Si. The enrichment
    process was undertaken by the Central Design Bureau of Machine Building in St
    Petersburg. Subsequently, a polycrystal was grown in the Institute of Chemistry
    of High-Purity Substances of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Nizhny Novgorod
    and a<sup>28</sup>Si boule was grown and purified by the Leibniz-Institut für
    Kristallzüchtung in Berlin. Isotope enrichment made it possible to apply isotope
    dilution mass spectroscopy, to determine the Avogadro constant with unprecedented
    accuracy, and to fulfil Egidi's dream.</p><p>To convey Egidi's 'fantasy' into
    practice, two<sup>28</sup>Si kilogram prototypes shaped as quasi-perfect spheres
    were manufactured by the Australian Centre for Precision Optics; their isotopic
    composition, molar mass, mass, volume, density and lattice parameter were accurately
    determined and their surfaces were chemically and physically characterized at
    the atomic scale. The paper by Andreas et al reviews the work carried out; it
    collates all the findings and illustrates how Avogadro's constant was obtained.
    Impurity concentration and gradients in the enriched crystal were measured by
    infrared spectroscopy and taken into account; Zakel et al relate these measurements
    in detail. Next, Pramann et al illustrate how the molar mass of the enriched crystal
    was measured by exploiting isotopic enrichment and isotope dilution mass spectrometry.
    Valkiers et al report about remeasurement of the molar mass of a natural Si crystal,
    a measurement prompted by the exigency of clarifying the origin of the discrepancy
    between the N<sub>A</sub> value given in the present issue and the value obtained
    using natural Si crystals. A consistency analysis of the different isotopic-composition
    determinations is illustrated in the paper by Bulska et al. As reported in two
    papers by Massa et al, to determine the lattice parameter an x-ray interferometer
    was manufactured from the material between the already mentioned spheres. The
    measurement result was combined with lattice comparisons between different crystal
    samples and with the impurity gradient to extrapolate the sphere's lattice-parameter.
    Ferroglio et al's contribution analyzes the self-weight deformation of the x-ray
    interferometer. Fujimoto et al report about the lattice-perfection investigations
    carried out by a novel self-referencing diffractometer at the National Laboratory
    for High-Energy Physics (KEK) in Japan. A really great effort was made to characterize
    the sphere surfaces and to correct for the oxide layer and the contaminating atoms.
    The results of these investigations are given by Busch et al. The sphere diameter
    and topography were measured by optical interferometry to nanometer accuracy;
    the papers of Bartl et al and Kuramoto et al describe how the sphere volumes were
    determined. Andreas et al's paper describes the calculation of phase corrections
    for the diameter measurements. The results of mass comparisons against the Pt–Ir
    standards of the BIPM, NMIJ and PTB are given by Picard et al.</p><p>The results
    reported in the present issue need to be completed. One of the necessary activities
    is to relate the mass of the<sup>28</sup>Si atom to its Compton wavelength to
    test the mass–energy–frequency equivalence. Another effort is to monitor the stability
    of the Pt–Ir prototype: the technologies described in the present issue can be
    refined and finalized to calculate the mass variation of 1 kg<sup>28</sup>Si spheres
    by monitoring the surface evolution without weighing them on a balance. The last
    activity is the determination of the mass of a<sup>28</sup>Si sphere by electrical
    measurements using a watt balance and without any reference to the Pt–Ir prototype.
    In this framework, it will be necessary to demonstrate the mutual consistency
    and the stability of both the electrical and crystal mise en pratique of a kilogram
    definition based on a conventional value of the Planck constant. A related issue
    is to develop suitable procedures and protocols to disseminate the unit of mass
    from the new realizations.</p><p>Since the molar Planck constant is well known
    via the measurement of the Rydberg constant, the accurate measurement of N<sub>A</sub>
    also provides an accurate and independent determination of the Planck constant,
    h. A comparison of the values of the Planck constant obtained via the watt-balance
    experiment and the N<sub>A</sub> determination tests quantum mechanics. In fact,
    the watt-balance value of h depends on solid state physics through the theories
    of Josephson and quantum Hall effects, whereas the value of h derived from N<sub>A</sub>
    depends on atomic physics through the energy level differences in hydrogen and
    deuterium, whose associated transition frequencies yield information on the Rydberg
    constant.</p><p>Grateful thanks are addressed to H-J Pohl for his outstanding
    project management in Russia, to A K Kaliteevski and his colleagues of the Central
    Design Bureau of Machine Building and the Institute of Chemistry of High-Purity
    Substances for their dedication and the punctual delivery of the enriched material,
    to H Riemann and his staff of the Institut für Kristallzüchtung for the crystal
    growth, to our directors for their advice and financial support, and to our colleagues
    for their daily work.</p><p>Special thanks are addressed to Peter Becker, to whom
    this issue is dedicated on the occasion of his retirement from work at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt. In 1974, young Peter joined the PTB's Avogadro group which, under
    the direction of Peter Seyfried, followed Bonse's work and improved the measurements
    of the lattice parameter and the Avogadro constant [5, 6]. In 2004, Peter proposed
    and backed this project by taking on his shoulders the risks, the management burden
    and the coordination of the many relevant activities.</p><p>References</p><p>[1]
