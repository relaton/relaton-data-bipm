- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>To determine the volume of solid density standards, manufactured as
    Si-crystal spheres, an optical interferometer is used to measure their diameter
    at the NMIJ. To support and complement these measurements, the effect of the Gouy
    phase has been studied analytically and numerically. In measurement, the sphere
    is placed between the end-mirrors of a Fizeau cavity and the distances between
    the cavity mirrors and the sphere are measured, as well as the cavity length.
    The present analysis outlines a model of the interferometer operation and quantifies
    the Gouy-phase correction in the diameter measurement.</p>"
