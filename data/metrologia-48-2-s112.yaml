abstract:
- content: "<p>For a new determination of the Avogadro constant to play a role in
    the future redefinition and realization of the mass unit, the mass measurements
    involved need to be carried out at a very high level of accuracy. From a mass
    comparison among two 1 kg<sup>28</sup>Si spheres and the 1 kg platinum–iridium
    (Pt/Ir) mass standards, the mass of the spheres must be determined with a combined
    standard uncertainty of less than 5 µg. The BIPM, the PTB and the NMIJ have carried
    out such a state-of-the-art mass comparison in air and under vacuum in order to
    reach this target set by the International Avogadro Coordination (IAC). The results
    obtained for the spheres AVO28-S5 and AVO28-S8 involved in the comparison have
    demonstrated that by using air buoyancy artefacts and sorption artefacts it is
    possible to achieve a relative uncertainty of 4.1 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. The reference
    value for each sphere has been determined, taking into account the traceability
    of the masses to the International Prototype of the kilogram,, in due consideration
    of the correlations among 17 standards used directly or indirectly in this comparison.</p>"
