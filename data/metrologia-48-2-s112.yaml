  content: "<p>For a new determination of the Avogadro constant to play a role in
    the future redefinition and realization of the mass unit, the mass measurements
    involved need to be carried out at a very high level of accuracy. From a mass
    comparison among two 1 kg <sup>28</sup>Si spheres and the 1 kg platinum–iridium
    (Pt/Ir) mass standards, the mass of the spheres must be determined with a combined
    standard uncertainty of less than 5 µg. The BIPM, the PTB and the NMIJ have carried
    out such a state-of-the-art mass comparison in air and under vacuum in order to
    reach this target set by the International Avogadro Coordination (IAC). The results
    obtained for the spheres AVO28-S5 and AVO28-S8 involved in the comparison have
    demonstrated that by using air buoyancy artefacts and sorption artefacts it is
    possible to achieve a relative uncertainty of 4.1 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. The reference
    value for each sphere has been determined, taking into account the traceability
    of the masses to the International Prototype of the kilogram, \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro380081in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>, in due consideration of
    the correlations among 17 standards used directly or indirectly in this comparison.</p>"
