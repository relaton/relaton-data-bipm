abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the scope of the efforts concerning the redefinition of the
    SI base unit ‘kilogram’ the final results of the international research project
    aiming at the redetermination of the Avogadro constant are ready to be announced.
    Among other quantities the volume of two spheres which are made of a highly enriched<sup>28</sup>Si
    single crystal had to be determined. For this purpose a special Fizeau interferometer
    for the measurement of the spheres' diameters has been developed at PTB. This
    paper reports the final results of the volumes, the uncertainties and also the
    latest findings regarding systematic corrections including the effects of surface
    layers on the pure silicon core. The results are confirmed by density comparison
    measurements.</p>"
