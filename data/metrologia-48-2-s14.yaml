abstract:
- content: "<p>Within the scope of re-determining the Avogadro constant, the content
    of impurities in ultra-pure, mono-isotopically enriched silicon ‘Si28’ was measured
    by infrared spectrometry. The calibration factors required for the calculation
    of the concentrations from the maximum absorption coefficients had to be determined
    in this context for the isotopically enriched material. For this purpose a model
    was prepared, which enables conversion of the factors for Si with natural isotopic
    abundance. On the basis of these results, the concentrations of the three most
    decisive impurities in the enriched material were determined. These are oxygen
    atoms on interstitial sites and substituting carbon and boron atoms which occupy
    silicon sites. Whereas carbon and oxygen were measured in accordance with standardized
    procedures modified for the particular metrological use, the absorption measurement
    of the boron was carried out differently to the conventional standard. The concentrations
    determined for the three types of crystal impurities are high enough to make a
    correction of the lattice parameter for the ‘Si28’ material necessary.</p>"
