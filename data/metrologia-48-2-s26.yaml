abstract:
- content: "<p>A procedure is described to obtain SI-traceable silicon isotope amount
    ratios in the BaSiF<sub>6</sub> form. On the basis of a gravimetric approach,
    three synthetic isotope mixtures were made, very similar to natural Si, by blending
    silicon isotopically enriched with<sup>28</sup>Si,<sup>29</sup>Si and<sup>30</sup>Si.
    These mixtures served as references to calibrate measurements of (SiF<sub>3</sub>)<sup>+</sup>
    current ratios. In this way, it was possible to make SI-traceable measurements
    of silicon isotope amount ratios, without any assumptive correction. The isotopic
    composition of the natural Si crystal WASO17.2 was remeasured and its molar mass
    was redetermined.</p>"
