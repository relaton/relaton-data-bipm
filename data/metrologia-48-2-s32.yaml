abstract:
- content: "<p>To determine the Avogadro constant by counting the atoms in quasi-perfect
    spheres made of a silicon crystal highly enriched with<sup>28</sup>Si, the isotopic
    composition of the crystal was measured in different laboratories by different
    measurement methods. This paper examines the consistency of the measurement results.</p>"
