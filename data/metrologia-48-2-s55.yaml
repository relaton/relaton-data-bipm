  content: "<p>The homogeneity of the lattice spacings of silicon single crystals
    from different origins was characterized. Strain measurements were performed on
    single crystals from NRLM3, NRLM4 and 28Si-10Pr11 ingots, which are all used to
    determine the Avogadro constant. NRLM3 and NRLM4 both exhibited clear striations,
    whereas almost no pattern was obtained for 28Si-10Pr11. The standard deviation
    of the lattice spacing of the single crystal obtained from 28Si-10Pr11 was 4.7
    × 10<sup>−9</sup>, which enabled the lattice spacing to be determined with a standard
    uncertainty of 3 × 10<sup>−9</sup>.</p>"
