  content: "<p>The volumes of two 1 kg silicon spheres, AVO28-S5 and AVO28-S8, fabricated
    from a <sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal were measured to determine the Avogadro
    constant by the x-ray crystal density method in the International Avogadro Coordination
    Project. The volumes were determined from diameter measurements of the two spheres
    using a laser interferometer with a flat etalon. In the diameter measurement,
    the sphere was placed between the two flat etalon plates. The gaps between the
    sphere and the etalon plates and the distance between the etalon plates were measured
    by phase-shifting interferometry with optical frequency tuning. The apparent volumes
    of the <sup>28</sup>Si spheres were determined from the diameter measurement in
    many directions with relative combined standard uncertainties of 5.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup>
    and 4.4 × 10<sup>−8</sup> for AVO28-S5 and AVO28-S8, respectively. The effect
    of the surface layer on the diameter measurement was evaluated on the basis of
    the results of characterizing the sphere surface. By taking into account the effect
    of the surface layer, the silicon core volume excluding the surface layer and
    the actual volume including the surface layer were also determined. Details of
    the interferometer, data analysis and the uncertainty in the measurement are described.</p>"
