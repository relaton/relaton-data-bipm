abstract:
- content: "<p>The design, operating parameters and the accuracy evaluation of the
    NPL Rb atomic fountain are described. The atomic fountain employs a double magneto-optical
    arrangement that allows a large number of<sup>87</sup>Rb atoms to be trapped,
    a water-cooled temperature-stabilized interrogation region and a high quality
    factor interrogation cavity. From the uncertainties of measured and calculated
    systematic frequency shifts, the fractional frequency accuracy is estimated to
    be 3.7 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. The fractional frequency stability, limited predominantly
    by noise in the local oscillator, is measured to be 7 × 10<sup>−16</sup> after
    one day of averaging. Based on the proposed quasi-continuous regime of operation
    of the fountain, the accuracy of the Rb standard of 5 × 10<sup>−17</sup> reachable
    in two days of averaging is predicted.</p>"
