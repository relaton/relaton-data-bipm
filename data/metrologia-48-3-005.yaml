abstract:
- content: "<p>The electromagnetic fields and eigen-frequencies of triaxially ellipsoidal
    resonators have been calculated. The method used is modal superposition, based
    on the decomposition of the fields inside the resonator into a series expansion,
    with unknown coefficients, of the eigen-states of a spherical resonator. The coefficients
    and eigen-frequencies have then been calculated by minimizing the rms electric
    field at the resonator surface using software designed within MatLab®. Accuracies
    of parts in 10<sup>10</sup> have been obtained for the eigen-frequencies, and
    the dependence of the calculations on the ellipsoidal eccentricities and the resonator
    modes has been analysed. The results are compared with those of Mehl (2009 Metrologia
    46 554–9), who used a second-order approximation. The method of modal superposition
    has the potential for solving many similar problems in resonators of arbitrary
    shapes.</p>"
