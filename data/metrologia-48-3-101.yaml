  content: "<p>The correction due to the finite speed of light is among the most inconsistent
    in absolute gravimetry. Formulae reported by different authors yield corrections
    scattered up to 8 µGal for no obvious reasons. The problem, though noted before,
    has never been studied, and nowadays the correction is rather postulated than
    rigorously proven. In this paper we make an attempt to revise the subject. Like
    other authors, we use physical models based on signal delays and the Doppler effect;
    however, in implementing the models we additionally introduce two scales of time
    associated with moving and stationary reflectors, derive a set of rules to switch
    between the scales and establish the equivalence of trajectory distortions as
    obtained from either time delay or distance progression. The obtained results
    enabled us to produce accurate correction formulae for different types of instruments,
    and to explain the differences in the results obtained by other authors. We found
    that the correction derived from the Doppler effect is accountable only for two-thirds
    of the total correction due to the finite speed of light, if no signal delays
    are considered. Another major source of inconsistency was found in the tacit use
    of simplified trajectory models.</p>"
