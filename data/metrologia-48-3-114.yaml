  content: <p>The electromagnetic fields and eigen-frequencies of triaxially ellipsoidal
    resonators have been calculated. The method used is modal superposition, based
    on the decomposition of the fields inside the resonator into a series expansion,
    with unknown coefficients, of the eigen-states of a spherical resonator. The coefficients
    and eigen-frequencies have then been calculated by minimizing the rms electric
    field at the resonator surface using software designed within MatLab®. Accuracies
    of parts in 10<sup>10</sup> have been obtained for the eigen-frequencies, and
    the dependence of the calculations on the ellipsoidal eccentricities and the resonator
    modes has been analysed. The results are compared with those of Mehl (<ext-link

    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>46</bold> 554–9</ext-link>), who used a second-order
    approximation. The method of modal superposition has the potential for solving
    many similar problems in resonators of arbitrary shapes.</p>
