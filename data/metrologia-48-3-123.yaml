abstract:
- content: "<p>A piston prover determines the gas flow rate by measuring the time
    interval that a movable piston inside a cylinder needs to pass a known volume
    of gas at a defined pressure and temperature. This paper deals with the dynamic
    effects related to the operation of a high-speed, clearance-sealed realization
    of the piston prover concept. Its dynamic characteristics are analysed by means
    of pressure-response measurements and lumped-element mathematical modelling. The
    experimental results show that the pressure oscillations during the timing cycle
    increase significantly above a certain flow rate and have multiple frequency components.
    They could be related to the resonance effects of the piston oscillator, which
    is excited by the flow instabilities of the gas flowing in the cylinder below
    the piston. The simulations show that the sensitivity to the dynamic pressure
    effects depends on the properties of the thermodynamic gas processes being adiabatic,
    polytropic or isothermal. A new, modified flow equation of the piston prover,
    which considers the polytropic index as an input variable, is proposed.</p>"
