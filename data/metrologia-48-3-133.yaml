  content: "<p>The METAS watt balance project was initiated slightly more than a decade
    ago. Over this time, the apparatus has been through an uninterrupted series of
    upgrades that have improved its reliability to a point where continuous series
    of measurements can be taken fully automatically over periods of several months.
    A comprehensive analysis of possible systematic errors has now been completed
    and a large set of data has been analysed to calculate a value for the Planck
    constant <italic>h</italic>. This paper describes the watt balance in detail,
    explains the data acquisition and analysis thoroughly and presents the uncertainty
    budget. The value of the Planck constant determined with our apparatus is <italic>h</italic>
    = 6.626 069 1(20) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s with a relative standard uncertainty
    of 0.29 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. This value differs from the 2006 CODATA adjustment
    by 0.024 µW W<sup>−1</sup>.</p>"
