abstract:
- content: "<p>The METAS watt balance project was initiated slightly more than a decade
    ago. Over this time, the apparatus has been through an uninterrupted series of
    upgrades that have improved its reliability to a point where continuous series
    of measurements can be taken fully automatically over periods of several months.
    A comprehensive analysis of possible systematic errors has now been completed
    and a large set of data has been analysed to calculate a value for the Planck
    constant h. This paper describes the watt balance in detail, explains the data
    acquisition and analysis thoroughly and presents the uncertainty budget. The value
    of the Planck constant determined with our apparatus is h = 6.626 069 1(20) ×
    10<sup>−34</sup> J s with a relative standard uncertainty of 0.29 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.
    This value differs from the 2006 CODATA adjustment by 0.024 µW W<sup>−1</sup>.</p>"
