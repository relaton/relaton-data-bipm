abstract:
- content: "<p>The Boltzmann constant k was measured by comparing the Johnson noise
    of a resistor at the triple point of water with a quantum-based voltage reference
    signal generated with a superconducting Josephson-junction waveform synthesizer.
    The measured value of k = 1.380 651(17) × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup> is
    consistent with the current CODATA value and the combined uncertainties. This
    is our first measurement of k with this electronic technique, and the first noise-thermometry
    measurement to achieve a relative combined uncertainty of 12 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>.
    We describe the most recent improvements to our Johnson-noise thermometer that
    enabled the statistical uncertainty contribution to be reduced to seven parts
    in 10<sup>6</sup>, as well as the further reduction of spurious systematic errors
    and electromagnetic interference effects. The uncertainty budget for this measurement
    is discussed in detail.</p>"
