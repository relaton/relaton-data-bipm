  content: "<p>The Boltzmann constant <italic>k</italic> was measured by comparing
    the Johnson noise of a resistor at the triple point of water with a quantum-based
    voltage reference signal generated with a superconducting Josephson-junction waveform
    synthesizer. The measured value of <italic>k</italic> = 1.380 651(17) × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>
    is consistent with the current CODATA value and the combined uncertainties. This
    is our first measurement of <italic>k</italic> with this electronic technique,
    and the first noise-thermometry measurement to achieve a relative combined uncertainty
    of 12 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>. We describe the most recent improvements to our
    Johnson-noise thermometer that enabled the statistical uncertainty contribution
    to be reduced to seven parts in 10<sup>6</sup>, as well as the further reduction
    of spurious systematic errors and electromagnetic interference effects. The uncertainty
    budget for this measurement is discussed in detail.</p>"
