abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper discusses simultaneous gravity and vertical gravity gradient
    measurements obtained with a newly designed recoil-compensated dropping chamber
    adapted to an FG5 absolute gravimeter. The new dropping chamber incorporates counterweights
    to compensate recoil effects. It has the same physical length as the standard
    FG5 dropping chamber but the free-fall distance was increased from 20 cm to 25 cm.
    The new drive train pulls on the centre of the system to reduce unwanted horizontal
    velocity and rotation of the free-falling test mass. The test-mass material was
    chosen to reduce possible magnetic eddy-current damping caused by external magnetic
    field gradients. External lead masses were used to change the gravity and vertical
    gravity gradient. The measurements agree well with the theoretical gravity field
    changes derived from the position of the external weights. The experiment clearly
    demonstrates the efficacy of using an absolute gravity meter to measure both the
    gravity and the gravity gradient signals caused by variations in the external
    gravity field. This technique shows promise for passive gravity-monitoring applications.</p>"
