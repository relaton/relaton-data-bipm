abstract:
- content: "<p>The overall uncertainty of a model prediction is a combination of the
    uncertainty of the input parameters and the uncertainty of the model assumptions.
    The former is referred to as parameter uncertainty; the latter model uncertainty.
    A method for quantifying model uncertainty is proposed for complicated numerical
    models that are not amenable to more traditional approaches. The method is based
    solely on comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements, with
    the difference reported in terms of only two metrics, a bias factor and a relative
    standard deviation. The simplicity of the approach makes it ideal for models used
    for regulatory compliance because approving authorities often lack detailed training
    in modelling and uncertainty analysis.</p>"
