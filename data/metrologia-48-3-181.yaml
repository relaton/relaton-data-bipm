abstract:
- content: "<p>A cleaning method using ultraviolet activated ozone has been developed
    at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). A comparison to test the effectiveness
    of this cleaning method with nettoyage-lavage cleaning on platinum–iridium artefacts
    and kilogram mass standards was undertaken at the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM). Three cleaning trials were performed to compare the effectiveness
    of the two methods at removing natural, medium and heavy levels of surface contamination.</p><p>Both
    the ultraviolet light/ozone method and the nettoyage-lavage method successfully
    removed both natural levels and medium levels of surface contamination. However,
    in the medium contamination trial nettoyage-lavage cleaning removed additional
    mass from the Pt/Ir mass standard under test that could not be accounted for in
    terms of surface contamination.</p><p>In the heavy contamination trial nettoyage-lavage
    cleaning successfully removed most of the contamination from the surface of the
    contaminated Pt/Ir mass standard. The ultraviolet light/ozone method removed about
    two thirds of the surface contamination and therefore for heavily contaminated
    mass standards it is advisable to pre-clean them with a solvent before ultraviolet/ozone
    cleaning.</p>"
