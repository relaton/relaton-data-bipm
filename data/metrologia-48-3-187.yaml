abstract:
- content: "<p>In a free-fall absolute gravimeter usually a Michelson type interferometer
    is employed to track the trajectory of a freely falling retroreflector. The accelerated
    motion of the retroreflector produces a Doppler-shift in the laser wavelength.
    From the interference signal (beat signal) of the Doppler-shifted and the reference
    electromagnetic waves the relative motion of the freely falling retroreflector
    with respect to an inertial reference retroreflector is reconstructed. Considerations
    of second-order Doppler-shift terms lead to a correction in the acceleration due
    to gravity of several microgals (1 µGal = 10 nm s<sup>−2</sup>). This correction
    is commonly called speed of light correction. To date different correction formulae
    have been proposed, which differ by several microgals.</p><p>In this paper we
    review several previous publications and show the reasons for the different results.</p>"
