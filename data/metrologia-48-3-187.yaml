    <p>In a free-fall absolute gravimeter usually a Michelson type interferometer is employed to track the trajectory of a freely falling retroreflector. The accelerated motion of the retroreflector produces a Doppler-shift in the laser wavelength. From the interference signal (beat signal) of the Doppler-shifted and the reference electromagnetic waves the relative motion of the freely falling retroreflector with respect to an inertial reference retroreflector is reconstructed. Considerations of second-order Doppler-shift terms lead to a correction in the acceleration due to gravity of several microgals (1 µGal = 10 nm s<sup>−2</sup>). This correction is commonly called <italic>speed of light correction</italic>. To date different correction formulae have been proposed, which differ by several microgals.</p>
    <p>In this paper we review several previous publications and show the reasons for the different results.</p>
