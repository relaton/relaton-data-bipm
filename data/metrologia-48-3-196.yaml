  content: "<p>Formal pair-wise temperature differences, a comparison reference value
    (CRV) and degree of equivalence, between the UK (NPL), Chinese (NIM) and Spanish
    (CEM) national measurement institutes (NMIs), are calculated from the results
    of a prototype key comparison of the ITS-90 above the silver point using high
    temperature fixed points (HTFPs) of Co–C (1324 °C), Pt–C (1738 °C) and Re–C (2474 °C).
    The <italic>local</italic> realizations of ITS-90 temperatures were assigned by
    NPL, NIM and CEM to their individual sets of HTFPs. NIM and CEM then transported
    their cells to NPL and the temperature was realized by all the cells determined
    in quasi-identical measurement conditions using a linear pyrometer. From these
    results the pair-wise temperature differences between the three institutes were
    established. In addition a non-weighted and a weighted CRV were calculated for
    the comparison and degree of equivalence estimated. The results show very close
    agreement of the ITS-90 as realized by the three institutes. It is argued that
    the ease of the comparison and the low uncertainties attained strongly suggest
    that HTFPs should be the scale comparison artefacts of choice when comparing primary
    realizations either of the ITS-90 or thermodynamic temperature.</p>"
