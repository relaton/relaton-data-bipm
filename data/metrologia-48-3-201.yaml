abstract:
- content: "<p>The curvature of a single crystal of Si with a thin epitaxial film
    of a SiGe alloy has been determined by measuring the spatial variation of lattice-plane
    orientation across the surface. The technique uses the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) lattice comparator (LC) with the capability to determine
    the orientation of lattice planes perpendicular to a curved crystal surface with
    a precision of approximately 2 × 10<sup>−9</sup> rad. The test vehicle for technique
    development was a NIST Standard Reference Material, SRM 2000, with a 49 nm thick
    film of Si–15% Ge on the surface. This alloy has a lattice parameter ≈0.6% larger
    than that of Si, and as the film was epitaxial with the Si substrate, the resultant
    stress in the Si–Ge film caused the die to be deformed into a curved shape. Measurement
    of the lattice-plane orientation as a function of position across the die surface
    allowed the die curvature to be determined, yielding a radius of curvature of
    275.6 m ± 3.6 m (two standard deviations). Precise measurements were enabled in
    part by careful characterization of systematic variations in the LC such as the
    beam profile and sample-stage repeatability. From the LC plane-orientation data,
    the surface topography along the data line was calculated and found to be well
    described by a parabola, with the residual having a standard deviation less than
    1 nm. More detailed examination of the LC data showed that the curvature of the
    die varied across the width of the die, decreasing towards the edges. Comparisons
    between the LC-determined topography profile and data obtained using an interferometric
    technique have resulted in valuable insights into issues such as establishing
    consistency across multiple measurement techniques, the role of within-die and
    within-wafer variations in curvature, and the implications of those issues for
    the development of standard reference materials and for the performance of devices
    fabricated using strain-engineering techniques.</p>"
