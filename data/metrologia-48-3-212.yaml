abstract:
- content: "<p>Absolute gravity measurements are based on the reconstruction of the
    free-falling motion of a test body in vacuum. In this paper, two large disturbing
    effects are studied, namely the non-gravitational accelerations originated by
    rotation and translation of the flying body. Their contribution to the uncertainty
    of the free-fall acceleration is evaluated using the Monte Carlo method as proposed
    in Supplement 1 to the GUM. The analysis is specifically applied to the IMGC-02
    absolute gravimeter, but can be easily extended to other instruments, including
    cold-atom gravimeters currently under development.</p>"
