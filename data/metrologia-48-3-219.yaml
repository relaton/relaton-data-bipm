abstract:
- content: "<p>The spectral radiant intensity of synchrotron radiation from electron
    storage rings can be calculated from basic electrodynamic relations (Schwinger
    equation). A storage ring can, thus, be used as a radiometric primary source standard.
    The Metrology Light Source (MLS), the dedicated electron storage ring of the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt, can be operated as a primary radiation source standard from the
    near infrared up to the soft x-ray region and its operational parameters can be
    adjusted and accurately measured in a wide range. The MLS electron beam current
    can be varied from 1 pA (one stored electron) up to 200 mA and, thus, the radiant
    intensity, being directly proportional to the stored current, can be varied by
    more than 11 decades. The electron energy, which has a large effect on the spectral
    shape of the spectrum, can be varied from 105 MeV up to 630 MeV. For the radiometric
    comparison, the total power irradiated into a well-defined solid angle was directly
    measured by a cryogenic radiometer as a primary detector standard and compared
    with the power calculated from the storage ring parameters. These measurements
    were performed for various electron energies in the range from 200 MeV to 630 MeV,
    thus varying the shape of the spectrum. For each electron energy setting, the
    power level was varied within the dynamic range of the cryogenic radiometer by
    a variation of the electron beam current. Good agreement was found for all parameter
    settings, thus validating the performance of the cryogenic radiometer and the
    storage ring parameter measurements within the related uncertainty budget.</p>"
