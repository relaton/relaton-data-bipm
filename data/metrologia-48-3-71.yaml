abstract:
- content: "<p>There is a common misconception among educators, and even some metrologists,
    that the Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub> is (or should be) a pure number, and
    not a constant of dimension N<sup>âˆ’1</sup> (where N is the dimension amount of
    substance). Amount of substance is (and always has been) measured as a ratio of
    other physical quantities, and not in terms of a specified pure number of elementary
    entities. Hence the Avogadro constant has always been defined in terms of the
    unit of amount of substance, and not vice versa. The proposed redefinition of
    the mole in terms of a fixed value of the Avogadro constant is examined, and it
    is shown that such a redefinition would not bring any significant metrological
    benefit. It is contended that such a redefinition would only add to the confusion
    in this field, and so should be rejected.</p>"
