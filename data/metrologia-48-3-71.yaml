  script: Latn
  content: "<p>There is a common misconception among educators, and even some metrologists,
    that the Avogadro constant <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> is (or should be) a
    pure number, and not a constant of dimension <bold>N</bold><sup>âˆ’1</sup> (where
    <bold>N</bold> is the dimension amount of substance). Amount of substance is (and
    always has been) measured as a ratio of other physical quantities, and not in
    terms of a specified pure number of elementary entities. Hence the Avogadro constant
    has always been defined in terms of the unit of amount of substance, and not vice
    versa. The proposed redefinition of the mole in terms of a fixed value of the
    Avogadro constant is examined, and it is shown that such a redefinition would
    not bring any significant metrological benefit. It is contended that such a redefinition
    would only add to the confusion in this field, and so should be rejected.</p>"
