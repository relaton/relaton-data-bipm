  content: "<p>It is widely accepted that improvement of the current International
    System of Units (SI) is necessary, and that central to this problem is redefinition
    of the kilogram. This paper compares the relative advantages of two main proposals
    for a modern scientific definition of the kilogram: an ‘electronic kilogram’ based
    on a fixed value of Planck's constant, and an ‘atomic kilogram’ based on a fixed
    value for Avogadro's number. A concrete and straightforward atomic definition
    of the kilogram is proposed. This definition is argued to be more experimentally
    neutral than the electronic kilogram, more realizable by school and university
    laboratories than the electronic kilogram, and more readily comprehensible than
    the electronic kilogram.</p>"
