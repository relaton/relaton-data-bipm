  content: "<p>We present a new type of measurement and the first results of determination
    of the optical to electrical delay of a photon counting detector. This type of
    measurement has not been reported for photon counting. The absolute value of the
    time interval between the time of arrival of the signal photon onto the detector
    input aperture and the time when the electrical output signal exceeds the pre-defined
    level must be determined. The optical to electrical delay value is required for
    ground-to-space laser time transfer with picosecond accuracy. The laser time transfer
    link is under construction for the European Space Agency for its application in
    the experiment Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space. We have developed the measurement
    technique and have measured the detection delay of the solid state photon counter.
    The experiment is described along with the first results.</p>"
