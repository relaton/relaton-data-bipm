abstract:
- content: "<p>The conventional definition of amount of substance n is as a quantity
    proportional to number of entities N. This implies that n is discrete for small
    N while n is considered to be continuous at the macroscopic scale, leading to
    a sorites paradox. A practical criterion is proposed for distinguishing between
    amount of substance and number of entities, and the implications for the conventional
    definition of amount of substance are discussed.</p>"
