  script: Latn
  content: "<p>The conventional definition of amount of substance <italic>n</italic>
    is as a quantity proportional to number of entities <italic>N</italic>. This implies
    that <italic>n</italic> is discrete for small <italic>N</italic> while <italic>n</italic>
    is considered to be continuous at the macroscopic scale, leading to a sorites
    paradox. A practical criterion is proposed for distinguishing between amount of
    substance and number of entities, and the implications for the conventional definition
    of amount of substance are discussed.</p>"
