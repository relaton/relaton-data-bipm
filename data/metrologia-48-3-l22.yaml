  content: "<p>Compact expressions for the GUM's ‘law of propagation of uncertainty’
    and its extensions, including the possible effects of corrections for non-linearity
    and including the effects of correlation in the variables, are obtained in terms
    of simple manipulations on three basic tensors: the gradient, the Hessian and
    the third order third derivative tensor of the measurement function. These formulae
    are an alternative to those involving mixed matrix and differential algebra. They
    provide a systematic and reproducible way to arrange the terms provided by the
    derivatives of various orders of a measurement function. The proposed formulae,
    which appear mathematically complicated, are surprisingly easy to implement in
    spreadsheet programs and interpreted matrix oriented programming languages. This
    is illustrated by means of an example of the propagation of uncertainty for the
    ratio of two normal and correlated variables.</p>"
