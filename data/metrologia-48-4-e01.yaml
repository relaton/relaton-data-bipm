abstract:
- content: '<p>The development of the first atomic frequency standard by Louis Essen
    in the 1950s is at the origin of the adoption of the atomic definition of the
    SI second by the 13th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1967 and the
    consequent adoption of the atomic timescale.</p><p>After the short reign of ephemeris
    time as the world''s reference timescale from 1954 until 1967, Coordinated Universal
    Time (UTC), synchronized to universal time UT1, appeared as the best compromise
    for satisfying the requests of all users. At the moment of the discussion on the
    adoption of an atomic timescale to replace ephemeris time, the possibility of
    having both an astronomical time and an atomic time to serve different purposes
    was discussed. In the words of Essen [1], this ''would cause endless confusion
    as well as involving duplication of equipment''.</p><p>Forty years after the adoption
    of the definition of Coordinated Universal Time at the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU), we are close to the moment of making a decision on whether or not
    to decouple UTC from its tight link to the rotation of the Earth embodied in UT1.
    It has been a ten-year process of discussion, mainly at the ITU with the input
    of the International Astronomical Union, the BIPM, the Consultative Committee
    for Time and Frequency and other organizations. The majority opinion supported
    the change based on developers and users of systems that need time synchronization
    to a stable and continuous reference timescale; others insist on the necessity
    of keeping the leap-second strategy for serving some applications or just for
    tradition. It is our hope that, as happened in the seventies, the most appropriate
    definition to serve all modern applications will be adopted with the consensus
    of the different sectors.</p><p>The redirection of international timekeeping from
    astronomy to metrology can be considered the benchmark that started the era of
    modern timescales, all based on atomic properties. The aim of this special issue
    of Metrologia is to review timescales in use today, either the internationally
    recognized references or those adapted to some specific applications, to discuss
    new and future developments and to present the sometimes complex procedures for
    making international recommendations.</p><p>We are grateful to our colleagues
    who, without exception, accepted our invitation to contribute to this special
    issue.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Henderson D 2005 Metrologia 42 S4–29</p><p>The pdf

    this issue".</p>'
