abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is the leading United
    Nations agency for Radio and Telecommunications coordination worldwide. The process
    of managing overall frequency spectrum utilization is through Worldwide Radio
    Conferences, associated radiocommunication conferences and the activities of the
    Radiocommunication Study Groups. These Study Groups and their Working Parties,
    devoted to specialized technical areas, provide the mechanism for Member Nations
    to participate, study and recommend standards and practices to ensure equitable
    utilization and interference-free operation within the radio spectrum. An important
    underlying aspect of spectrum utilization is the facilitation of the determination
    and coordination of the international time scale. The international time scale
    is an atomic time scale used by broadcast services throughout the world known
    as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC is defined by the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU-R) and is maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
    (BIPM) in cooperation with the International Earth reference and Rotation Service
    (IERS). Contributed measurements from timing centres around the world are used
    in the determination of UTC, which is adjusted to within 0.9â€‰s of Earth rotation
    time (UT1) by IERS-determined values of the Earth rotation. The adjustments, made
    in one second steps known as leap seconds, were implemented in 1972 to permit
    UT1 to be recovered from broadcast values of UTC for celestial navigation. Current
    telecommunications and navigation systems utilize continuous timing for their
    data transmissions; consequently, deliberations have been ongoing within the ITU-R
    on the issue of modifying the definition of UTC to a continuous time scale.</p>"
