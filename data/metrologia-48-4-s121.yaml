abstract:
- content: "<p>Since 1954 when the definition of the second first came under the authority
    of the intergovernmental organization of the Metre Convention, the range and complexity
    of time metrology have increased far beyond anything envisaged in those days.
    Today, the essential international coordination of this domain of metrology is
    through the organs of the Convention with the exception of the definition of Coordinated
    Universal Time, UTC. In this short article I suggest that this also should now
    come under the authority of the Metre Convention.</p>"
