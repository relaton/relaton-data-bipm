abstract:
- content: "<p>Astronomy has provided a means to mark the passage of time throughout
    history. One of the repeating phenomena that makes this possible is the Earth's
    rotation. The basic variability in its rotational speed, however, makes astronomical
    techniques unsuitable for timekeeping with the precision required for modern applications.
    Physical metrology from the first mechanical clocks to the most sophisticated
    atomic standards of today has assumed a growing role in timekeeping. Along with
    this progress in technology, more sophisticated concepts of timescales have appeared
    to take advantage of those improvements.</p>"
