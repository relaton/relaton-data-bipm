abstract:
- content: "<p>Local representations of the international time scale, Coordinated
    Universal Time (UTC), are maintained by approximately 69 national measurement
    institutes and other time laboratories. These laboratories contribute their clock
    and time transfer measurements for use in the computation of UTC. Although local
    representations of UTC, commonly called UTC(k) time scales, vary considerably,
    for example in the numbers of atomic clocks available, they also share many characteristics.
    In this paper, we examine the rationale and requirements for maintaining a local
    representation of UTC. Its applications might range from underpinning the reference
    time scale of a Global Navigation Satellite System to providing traceability for
    frequency and time dissemination services. We address the practical aspects of
    setting up and operating a UTC(k) time scale, including the equipment and algorithms
    that generate the time scale, optimize its performance and measure its offset
    from the similar time scales maintained by other laboratories. We conclude by
    considering briefly some future developments that may have an impact on the laboratories
    operating local representations of UTC.</p>"
