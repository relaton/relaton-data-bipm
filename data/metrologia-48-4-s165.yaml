abstract:
- content: "<p>Monitoring the Earth's rotation angle is essential in various domains
    linked to reference systems such as space navigation, precise orbit determinations
    of artificial Earth satellites including the Global Navigation Satellite Systems
    (GNSS), positional astronomy and for geophysical studies on time scales ranging
    from a few hours to decades.</p><p>Universal Time UT1 is based on the rotation
    of the Earth on its axis. Historically it was related to mean solar time on the
    meridian of Greenwich, sometimes known as Greenwich Mean Time. Monitoring Earth
    orientation, and in particular UT1, is the primary task of the International Earth
    Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). The Earth Orientation Center is
    responsible for monitoring Earth orientation parameters (EOPs) including long-term
    consistency and leap second announcements. The Rapid Service/Prediction Center
    is in charge of the rapid, near real-time solution and predictions. These two
    complementary services of the IERS provide Earth orientation information from
    results derived predominantly from Very Long Baseline Interferometry with valuable
    input from GNSS observations and global atmospheric angular momentum for both
    the combination and prediction of EOPs.</p>"
