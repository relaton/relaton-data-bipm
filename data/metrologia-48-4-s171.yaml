  content: "<p>The algorithms for relativistic time transfer in the vicinity of the
    Earth and in the solar system are derived. The concepts of proper time and coordinate
    time are distinguished. The coordinate time elapsed during the transport of a
    clock and the propagation of an electromagnetic signal is analysed in three coordinate
    systems: an Earth-Centred Inertial (ECI) coordinate system, an Earth-Centred Earth-Fixed
    (ECEF) coordinate system and a barycentric coordinate system. The timescales of
    Geocentric Coordinate Time (TCG), Terrestrial Time (TT) and Barycentric Coordinate
    Time (TCB) are defined and their relationships are discussed. Some numerical examples
    are provided to illustrate the magnitudes of the effects.</p>"
