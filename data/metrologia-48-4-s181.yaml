abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Conference held in 1884 at Washington defined a universal
    time as the mean solar time at the Greenwich meridian (GMT). Now, the Universal
    Time, version UT1, is strictly defined as proportional to the angle of rotation
    of the Earth in space. In this evolution, the departure of UT1 from GMT does not
    exceed one or two seconds. This is quite negligible when compared with the departure
    between the solar time and the legal time of citizens, which may exceed two hours
    without raising protests.</p>"
