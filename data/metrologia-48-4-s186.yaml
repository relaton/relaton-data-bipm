  content: "<p>Numerous time scales exist to address specific user requirements. Accurate
    dynamical time scales (barycentric, geocentric and terrestrial) have been developed
    based on the theory of relativity. A family of time scales has been developed
    based on the rotation of the Earth that includes Universal Time (specifically
    UT1), which serves as the traditional astronomical basis of civil time. International
    Atomic Time (TAI) is also maintained as a fundamental time scale based on the
    output of atomic frequency standards. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is an atomic
    scale for worldwide civil timekeeping, referenced to TAI, but with epoch adjustments
    via so-called leap seconds to remain within one second of UT1. A review of the
    development of the time scales, the status of the leap-second issue, and user
    considerations and perspectives are discussed. A description of some more recent
    applications for time usage is included.</p>"
