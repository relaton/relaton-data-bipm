  content: "<p>An astronomical or navigational almanac can best be thought of as a
    device for connecting an observer with celestial objects. For an observer with
    a known position and time the almanac allows the observer to identify the celestial
    objects. Conversely, if the observer knows what objects he is observing and when,
    the almanac allows him to determine his position. In either case, knowledge of
    the time is crucial in providing this link between the celestial objects and the
    observer through the almanac. This paper summarizes the various time scales used
    in the astronomical and nautical almanacs produced jointly by the US Naval Observatory
    and HM Nautical Almanac Office.</p>"
