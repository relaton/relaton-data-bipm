  content: "<p>This paper describes some of the design considerations behind the timescale
    transformation software provided by the International Astronomical Union's SOFA
    collaboration. The solution adopted by SOFA includes two-part Julian dates, to
    safeguard precision, and individual treatment of specific transformations, rather
    than a single general-purpose routine. Correct handling of UTC leap seconds was
    a particular challenge.</p>"
