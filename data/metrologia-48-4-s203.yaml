- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "<p>I describe the statistical considerations used to design systems whose
    clocks are compared by the use of dial-up telephone lines or the Internet to exchange
    timing information. The comparison is usually used to synchronize the time of
    a client system to the time of a server, which is, in turn, synchronized to the
    time scale of a national timing laboratory. The design includes a dynamic estimate
    of the system performance and a comparison between the performance and a parameter
    that specifies the required stability based on external considerations. The algorithm
    adjusts the polling interval and other parameters of the algorithm to realize
    the specified performance at minimal cost, where the cost is taken to be proportional
    to the inverse of the interval between message exchanges using either the Internet
    or dial-up telephone calls.</p>"
