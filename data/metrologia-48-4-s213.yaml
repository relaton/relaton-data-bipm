  content: "<p>The development and current status of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System
    are briefly introduced. The definition and realization of the system time scales
    are described in detail. The BeiDou system time (BDT) is an internal and continuous
    time scale without leap seconds. It is maintained by the time and frequency system
    of the master station. The frequency accuracy of BDT is superior to 2 × 10<sup>−14</sup>
    and its stability is better than 6 × 10<sup>−15</sup>/30 days. The satellite synchronization
    is realized by a two-way time transfer between the uplink stations and the satellite.
    The measurement uncertainty of satellite clock offsets is less than 2 ns. The
    BeiDou System has three modes of time services: radio determination satellite
    service (RDSS) one-way, RDSS two-way and radio navigation satellite service (RNSS)
    one-way. The uncertainty of the one-way time service is designed to be less than
    50 ns, and that of the two-way time service is less than 10 ns. Finally, some
    coordinate tactics of UTC from the viewpoint of global navigation satellite systems
    (GNSS) are discussed. It would be helpful to stop the leap second, from our viewpoint,
    but to keep the UTC name, the continuity and the coordinate function unchanged.</p>"
