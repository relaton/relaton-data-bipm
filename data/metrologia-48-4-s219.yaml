abstract:
- content: "<p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) use internal reference
    time scales: GPS Time, GLONASS Time, Galileo System Time and BeiDou System Time.
    Constructed from a clock ensemble, they are designed for internal system synchronization,
    necessary to produce a navigation solution. They are usually steered to an external
    stable reference time scale, for example UTC(USNO), modulo 1 s, for GPS time.
    To achieve safe operation of a GNSS, a system time should preferably be a uniform
    time scale not affected by the leap seconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
    But this is not compatible with international recommendations that radio broadcast
    time signals should conform as closely as possible to UTC. This paper describes
    the various approaches chosen by GNSS providers and the relation between GNSS
    system times and UTC in terms of numbering of seconds. Different solutions for
    numbering seconds do not help the GNSS interoperability. This paper also explains
    why, on some occasions, GNSS system times play a role of alternative time scales
    with the consequent risk of confusion.</p>"
