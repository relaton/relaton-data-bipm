  content: '<p>Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) use <italic toggle="yes">internal</italic>
    reference time scales: <italic toggle="yes">GPS Time</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">GLONASS
    Time, Galileo System Time</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BeiDou System Time</italic>.
    Constructed from a clock ensemble, they are designed for internal system synchronization,
    necessary to produce a navigation solution. They are usually steered to an external
    stable reference time scale, for example UTC(USNO), modulo 1 s, for <italic toggle="yes">GPS
    time</italic>. To achieve safe operation of a GNSS, a system time should preferably
    be a uniform time scale not affected by the leap seconds of Coordinated Universal
    Time (UTC). But this is not compatible with international recommendations that
    radio broadcast time signals should conform as closely as possible to UTC. This
    paper describes the various approaches chosen by GNSS providers and the relation
    between GNSS <italic toggle="yes">system times</italic> and UTC in terms of numbering
    of seconds. Different solutions for numbering seconds do not help the GNSS interoperability.
    This paper also explains why, on some occasions, GNSS <italic toggle="yes">system
    times</italic> play a role of alternative time scales with the consequent risk
    of confusion.</p>'
