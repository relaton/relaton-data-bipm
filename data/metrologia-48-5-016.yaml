abstract:
- content: "<p>Deformational characteristics of a controlled-clearance piston-cylinder
    (CCPC) have been evaluated to precisely estimate the pressure dependence of its
    effective area. Among the experimentally accessible characteristics, the jacket
    pressure coefficient d, which denotes the relative change in the effective area
    due to applied jacket pressure p<sub>j</sub>, is examined in this paper. Two methods
    for precisely determining d at pressures up to 1 GPa are proposed. One is a comparative
    method that uses a set of a pressure balance and a multiplier as the tare gauge.
    The other is a new method that uses precise pressure transducers as monitoring
    devices. Both p<sub>j</sub> and weights loaded on the CCPC are changed so that
    the pressure generated by the CCPC remains constant, which is monitored by the
    transducers. d is estimated by the relative change in the weights loaded on the
    CCPC itself. Using the two methods, d for a 1 MPa kg<sup>−1</sup> CCPC is measured
    at pressures up to 1 GPa. At each system pressure, d obtained by each method is
    approximated by a linear function of p<sub>j</sub>. The consistency of the fit
    values of d by the two methods is confirmed. The method using pressure transducers
    as monitoring devices is advantageous in terms of efficiency and operability especially
    at higher pressures.</p>"
