abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of the melting temperatures of four Pd–C eutectic
    fixed-point cells was performed using four Pt/Pd thermocouples. The cells are
    designed for the calibration of thermocouples and were constructed in the participating
    laboratories of NPL, LNE, NMIJ and PTB. The measurements were performed in four
    different high-temperature furnaces but by applying the same measurement procedure.
    In spite of slightly different cell designs and different material sources, the
    melting temperatures of three of the four Pd–C cells (NPL, LNE and NMIJ) agreed
    very well within their expanded uncertainties of k = 2.</p>"
