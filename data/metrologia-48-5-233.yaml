abstract:
- content: "<p>Application of least-squares as, for instance, in curve fitting is
    an important tool of data analysis in metrology. It is tempting to employ the
    supplement 1 to the GUM (GUM-S1) to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the
    resulting parameter estimates, although doing so is beyond the specified scope
    of GUM-S1. We compare the result of such a procedure with a Bayesian uncertainty
    analysis of the corresponding regression model. It is shown that under certain
    assumptions both analyses yield the same results but this is not true in general.
    Some simple examples are given which illustrate the similarities and differences
    between the two approaches.</p>"
