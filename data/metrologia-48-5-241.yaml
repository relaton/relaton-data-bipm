abstract:
- content: "<p>One of a set of metal–carbon eutectic cells (a Pd–C cell, 1765 K) manufactured
    by NPL and used for a previous comparison of temperature scales with NIST has
    been investigated at INRIM. There it was implemented in two different furnaces,
    namely a single- and a three-zone, and measured with a standard radiation thermometer
    operating at 900 nm and 950 nm. Both ITS-90 and thermodynamic melting temperatures
    of the cell were determined by means of an extrapolation approach. The thermodynamic
    temperature differs by only −0.31 K from the NIST value whereas the ITS-90 temperature
    differs by only −0.46 K from the NPL value. The agreements, within the combined
    expanded uncertainties, are particularly significant, because of the different
    approach followed at INRIM, namely the extrapolation of multi-fixed-point scales
    (n = 3 and n = 4), as compared with a direct radiometric method at NIST and an
    ITS-90 realization traceable to the gold point at NPL.</p>"
