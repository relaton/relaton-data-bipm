    <p>The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), Sèvres, France, hosted the 7th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG) and the associated Relative Gravity Campaign (RGC) from August to September 2005.</p>
    <p>ICAG 2005 was prepared and performed as a metrological pilot study, which aimed:</p>
    <p>(1) To determine the gravity comparison reference values;</p>
    <p>(2) To determine the offsets of the absolute gravimeters; and</p>
    <p>(3) As a pilot study to accumulate experience for the CIPM Key Comparisons.</p>
    <p>This document presents a complete and extensive review of the technical protocol and data processing procedures. The 1st ICAG–RGC comparison was held at the BIPM in 1980–1981 and since then meetings have been organized every 4 years.</p>
    <p>In this paper, we present an overview of how the meeting was organized, the conditions of BIPM gravimetric sites, technical specifications, data processing strategy and an analysis of the final results. This 7th ICAG final report supersedes all previously published reports.</p>
    <p>Readings were obtained from participating instruments, 19 absolute gravimeters and 15 relative gravimeters. Precise levelling measurements were carried out and all measurements were performed on the BIPM micro-gravity network which was specifically designed for the comparison.</p>
