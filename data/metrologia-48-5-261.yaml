  content: "<p>We report on a successful bilateral intercomparison between the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
    In both laboratories deuterium lamps were calibrated using the calculability of
    synchrotron radiation. However, the methods applied in the two laboratories differed
    significantly. Whereas the calibrations at PTB were performed in vacuum and led
    to spectral radiant intensities, the measurements at NIST were done in air and
    resulted in spectral irradiances. Therefore, for this bilateral comparison we
    not only proved the equivalence of the two measurement procedures, but also the
    validity of the conversion between the different spectro-radiometric quantities.
    This successful comparison re-establishes the usefulness of deuterium lamps as
    transfer standards in the ultraviolet spectral range.</p>"
