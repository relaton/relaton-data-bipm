abstract:
- content: "<p>The expression of uncertainty in the field of metrology is based, since
    1993, on the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. According
    to this, ‘it is assumed that the results of a measurement have been corrected
    for all recognized significant systematic effects’. Since the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 considers the substances used for the realization of the ‘fixed
    points’ to be ideally pure, to fully implement the intent of the GUM corrections
    should be applied for any chemical impurities that affect the value of the measurand.
    The present paper aims at reviewing an aspect that must be tackled to arrive to
    reliable and scientifically sound corrections: the use of an appropriate statistical
    method. In addition to the SIE, OME and hybrid methods recommended by the CCT,
    two new approaches are proposed in this paper, called one-sided OME and Average
    Overall Estimate (AOE). They are illustrated and their merits compared with the
    previous one, by applying them for the correction of the measured values of the
    triple-point temperature of the four gaseous substances (hydrogen, neon, oxygen
    and argon) used for the realization of the ITS-90 reference points in the range
    13.8 K to 273.16 K. Some suggestions are drawn from the resulting evidence.</p>"
