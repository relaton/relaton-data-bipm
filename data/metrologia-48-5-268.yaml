  content: "<p>The expression of uncertainty in the field of metrology is based, since
    1993, on the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>.
    According to this, ‘it is assumed that the results of a measurement have been
    corrected for all recognized significant systematic effects’. Since the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 considers the substances used for the realization of
    the ‘fixed points’ to be ideally pure, to fully implement the intent of the GUM
    corrections should be applied for any chemical impurities that affect the value
    of the measurand. The present paper aims at reviewing an aspect that must be tackled
    to arrive to reliable and scientifically sound corrections: the use of an appropriate
    statistical method. In addition to the SIE, OME and hybrid methods recommended
    by the CCT, two new approaches are proposed in this paper, called one-sided OME
    and Average Overall Estimate (AOE). They are illustrated and their merits compared
    with the previous one, by applying them for the correction of the measured values
    of the triple-point temperature of the four gaseous substances (hydrogen, neon,
    oxygen and argon) used for the realization of the ITS-90 reference points in the
    range 13.8 K to 273.16 K. Some suggestions are drawn from the resulting evidence.</p>"
