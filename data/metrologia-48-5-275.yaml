  content: "<p>An interlaboratory comparison of the melting temperatures of three
    palladium–carbon (Pd–C) eutectic fixed-point cells of different designs and usable
    for the calibration of thermocouples was performed at NIM. Two Pt/Pd thermocouples
    were constructed for this particular purpose. One of the Pd–C eutectic cells is
    of conventional design and size; the two other cells are miniature fixed-point
    cells of different designs. The melting temperature of the conventional cell,
    PdC1-NIM, was slightly higher than the melting temperatures of the miniature cells
    by about 160 mK (PdCM2 of PTB) and 290 mK (PdC2-NIM). The melting temperatures
    of the two miniature Pd–C cells agree within their measurement uncertainties for
    <italic>k</italic> = 2 of about 135 mK. Furthermore, a new aspect of leakage effects
    often observed in the use of Pd–C cells is presented.</p>"
