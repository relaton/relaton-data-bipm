  content: "<p>We evaluate the distributed cavity phase (DCP) and microwave lensing
    frequency shifts, which were the two largest sources of uncertainty for the NPL-CsF2
    caesium fountain clock. We report measurements that confirm a detailed theoretical
    model of the microwave cavity fields and the frequency shifts of the clock that
    they produce. The model and measurements significantly reduce the DCP uncertainty
    to 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. We derive the microwave lensing frequency shift for
    a cylindrical cavity with circular apertures. An analytic result with reasonable
    approximations is given, in addition to a full calculation that indicates a shift
    of 6.2 × 10<sup>−17</sup>. The measurements and theoretical models we report,
    along with improved evaluations of collisional and microwave leakage induced frequency
    shifts, reduce the frequency uncertainty of the NPL-CsF2 standard to 2.3 × 10<sup>−16</sup>,
    nearly a factor of two lower than its most recent complete evaluation.</p>"
