abstract:
- content: "<p>An absolute gravimeter allows us to determine the local value of gravity,
    which makes its accuracy assessment challenging. The instrumental offsets are
    classically estimated by performing comparisons of the results obtained by a set
    of instruments measuring at the same location but at different epochs (measuring
    at the same place and epoch is physically impossible). Such intercomparison campaigns
    have been done a few times since 1980. In this paper, we discuss the method of
    data processing used for those comparisons. We demonstrate that one of the methods
    used is inadequate, as it underestimates the dispersion of the instrumental offsets,
    which is the only reliable quantity that can be obtained from such a comparison.
    We also propose a new criterion, based on the minimization of the L1 norm of the
    offsets, for fixing the constant of the ill-conditioned problem, which we show
    to be statistically more precise than the one classically used.</p>"
