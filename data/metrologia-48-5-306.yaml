abstract:
- content: "<p>We have analysed the uncertainty of measured electron density using
    a phase-resolved wave cutoff probe and compared it with a previous cutoff probe.
    To determine the cutoff frequency (i.e. plasma frequency), we used the phase difference
    between two antennas of the cutoff probe and its slow time modulation instead
    of the transmittance used in the previous cutoff method. The phase-resolved cutoff
    method gives remarkable results under wide discharge conditions. The uncertainty
    of the phase-resolved cutoff method is much better than the previous cutoff method.</p>"
