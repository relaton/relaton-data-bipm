abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the last 15 years, research in ac Josephson voltage metrology
    has focused on two fundamentally different systems: the programmable and the pulse-driven
    Josephson voltage standards (JVSs). This paper reports the first high precision
    comparison between the two types of JVS. The METAS programmable voltage standard
    was moved from Switzerland to the Netherlands to be compared with the Dutch pulse-driven
    system during four days in November 2010. After a careful investigation of the
    systematic sources of errors, the comparison was made at a frequency of 500 Hz
    and an rms amplitude of 104 mV. At that level, the voltage difference measured
    between the fundamental frequency components of the two standards was −0.18 ±
    0.26 µV V<sup>−1</sup> (k = 2), showing an excellent agreement between the two
    systems.</p>"
