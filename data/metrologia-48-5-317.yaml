abstract:
- content: "<p>An intercomparison of the absorbed dose rate in tissue,, at radiation
    protection levels for beta dosimetry was performed between two national metrology
    institutes, the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM) in St Petersburg
    (Russia) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig (Germany),
    from 2009 to 2010. For this comparison, radiation sources of both institutes were
    calibrated using the primary standard measuring devices (extrapolation chambers)
    of both institutes, i.e. no transfer instrument was used as both primary standards
    were directly compared. The values of the absorbed dose rates in tissue agree
    within 1.2% for two different<sup>90</sup>Sr/<sup>90</sup>Y sources, within 1.0%
    for one<sup>85</sup>Kr source and within 1.5% and 4.2% for two different<sup>147</sup>Pm
    sources. All these deviations are within 1 to 2 times the corresponding standard
    deviations.</p>"
