  content: "<p>An intercomparison of the absorbed dose rate in tissue, \n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro389605in001.gif\"></inline-graphic>, at radiation protection
    levels for beta dosimetry was performed between two national metrology institutes,
    the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM) in St Petersburg (Russia) and
    the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig (Germany), from
    2009 to 2010. For this comparison, radiation sources of both institutes were calibrated
    using the primary standard measuring devices (extrapolation chambers) of both
    institutes, i.e. no transfer instrument was used as both primary standards were
    directly compared. The values of the absorbed dose rates in tissue agree within
    1.2% for two different <sup>90</sup>Sr/<sup>90</sup>Y sources, within 1.0% for
    one <sup>85</sup>Kr source and within 1.5% and 4.2% for two different <sup>147</sup>Pm
    sources. All these deviations are within 1 to 2 times the corresponding standard
    deviations.</p>"
