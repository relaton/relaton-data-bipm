  content: "<p>Simple expressions are obtained for the measurement uncertainty of
    complex quantities when no information about phase is available. Three different
    cases are considered: a known magnitude, an upper bound on the magnitude and an
    estimate of the magnitude with an associated uncertainty. An expression is also
    given for the uncertainty of a product when there is no information about the
    phase of the factors. These results are applied to simple examples of power, attenuation
    and impedance measurements. The performance of uncertainty calculations is checked
    by observing the coverage of uncertainty statements achieved under simulated measurement
    conditions.</p>"
