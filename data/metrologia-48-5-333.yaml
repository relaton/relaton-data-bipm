abstract:
- content: "<p>Supplement 1 to the GUM (GUM-S1) produces an arbitrarily large sample
    from a probability distribution for the measurand which is used for the calculation
    of an estimate and its associated uncertainty. In the presence of Gaussian observations
    on one or several input quantities this distribution is equivalent to the Bayesian
    posterior obtained for a particular choice of a non-informative prior. Recently,
    a reference prior under partial information was proposed as an alternative non-informative
    prior in this context. Since for non-linear problems different results are obtained
    with this prior than by application of GUM-S1, the question arises whether GUM-S1
    should actually be recommended for non-linear problems.</p><p>We address this
    question by comparing the properties of the GUM-S1 distribution and the posterior
    distribution obtained by the proposed alternative prior. The comparison is supplemented
    by also considering a hybrid prior which assigns a constant prior for the measurand.
    We specify the conditions when the same results are reached. While the GUM-S1
    distribution is always proper, we show that the proposed reference prior under
    partial information and the hybrid prior can fail to yield a proper posterior.
    On the basis of this (most important) criterion we can already recommend application
    of GUM-S1. Finally, we show that the prior underlying GUM-S1 can be derived as
    a (conditional) data-translated likelihood prior that exploits the symmetry and
    invariance of the considered likelihood function.</p>"
