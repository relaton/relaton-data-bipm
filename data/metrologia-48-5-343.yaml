abstract:
- content: "<p>The effects of different working conditions and specifically of different
    velocity profiles on the output of a commercial cup anemometer were analysed experimentally.
    A simple mathematical model is also presented and provides results in line with
    the experiments. Results show that a cup anemometer with certain geometrical features
    can be calibrated through a rotating drag rig by correcting for the bias on the
    instrument output. The increase in uncertainty caused by this systematic correction
    was evaluated and applied to the results. The correction was validated by checking
    the compatibility of calibrations of a cup anemometer at the rotating rig and
    in a wind tunnel.</p>"
