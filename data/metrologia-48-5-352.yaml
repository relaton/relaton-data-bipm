  content: "<p>Deformational characteristics of a controlled-clearance piston-cylinder
    (CCPC) have been evaluated to precisely estimate the pressure dependence of its
    effective area. Among the experimentally accessible characteristics, the jacket
    pressure coefficient <italic>d</italic>, which denotes the relative change in
    the effective area due to applied jacket pressure <italic>p</italic><sub>j</sub>,
    is examined in this paper. Two methods for precisely determining <italic>d</italic>
    at pressures up to 1 GPa are proposed. One is a comparative method that uses a
    set of a pressure balance and a multiplier as the tare gauge. The other is a new
    method that uses precise pressure transducers as monitoring devices. Both <italic>p</italic><sub>j</sub>
    and weights loaded on the CCPC are changed so that the pressure generated by the
    CCPC remains constant, which is monitored by the transducers. <italic>d</italic>
    is estimated by the relative change in the weights loaded on the CCPC itself.
    Using the two methods, <italic>d</italic> for a 1 MPa kg<sup>−1</sup> CCPC is
    measured at pressures up to 1 GPa. At each system pressure, <italic>d</italic>
    obtained by each method is approximated by a linear function of <italic>p</italic><sub>j</sub>.
    The consistency of the fit values of <italic>d</italic> by the two methods is
    confirmed. The method using pressure transducers as monitoring devices is advantageous
    in terms of efficiency and operability especially at higher pressures.</p>"
