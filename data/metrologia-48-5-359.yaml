abstract:
- content: "<p>The throughput performance of a ten-element transmission trap detector
    has been investigated at the laser wavelength 647.1 nm. The input beam of 1/e<sup>2</sup>
    diameter 1.9 mm was studied at the output of the device in both s and p polarization
    states. The beam diameter was measured to change by less than 0.1 mm after undergoing
    ten internal reflections within the transmission trap detector for both polarization
    states of the incoming beam. The transmitted beam was observed to maintain a Gaussian
    distribution profile of the optical power intensity along the propagation direction,
    when compared with that of the input beam.</p>"
