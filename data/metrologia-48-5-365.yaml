abstract:
- content: "<p>An Elekta Synergy clinical linac facility is now in routine use at
    the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). For the purpose of therapy-level dosimetry,
    this has replaced the NPL research linac, which is over 40 years old, and in which
    the NPL absorbed dose primary standard for high-energy photons was established.
    This standard has been disseminated to clinical beams by interpolation of the
    calibration factor as a function of tissue phantom ratio TPR<sub>20/10</sub>.
    In this work the absorbed dose standard has been commissioned in all the beams
    produced by the Elekta Synergy linac. Reference standard ionization chambers have
    been calibrated in terms of absorbed dose to graphite and this calibration has
    been converted to one in terms of absorbed dose to water. The results have been
    combined with the calibration in<sup>60</sup>Co Î³-rays to obtain measured values
    for the quality-dependent correction, k<sub>Q</sub>, for these reference standard
    chambers used in the Elekta beams. The resulting data are consistent with the
    interpolated k<sub>Q</sub> to within 0.4%, which is less than the combined standard
    uncertainty of k<sub>Q</sub>, 0.56%.</p>"
