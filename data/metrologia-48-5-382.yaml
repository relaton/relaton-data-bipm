abstract:
- content: "<p>Within an international project directed to the new definition of the
    base unit kelvin, the Boltzmann constant k has been determined by dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry at PTB. In the pressure range from about 1 MPa to 7 MPa, 11 helium
    isotherms have been measured at the triple point of water (TPW) by applying a
    new special experimental setup consisting of a large-volume thermostat, a vacuum-isolated
    measuring system, stainless-steel 10 pF cylindrical capacitors, an autotransformer
    ratio capacitance bridge, a high-purity gas-handling system including a mass spectrometer,
    and traceably calibrated special pressure balances with piston–cylinder assemblies
    having effective areas of 2 cm<sup>2</sup>. The value of k has been deduced from
    the linear, ideal-gas term of an appropriate virial expansion fitted to the combined
    isotherms. A detailed uncertainty budget has been established by performing Monte
    Carlo simulations. The main uncertainty components result from the measurement
    of pressure and capacitance as well as the influence of the effective compressibility
    of the measuring capacitor and impurities contained in the helium gas. The combination
    of the results obtained at the TPW (k<sub>TPW</sub> = 1.380 654 × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>,
    relative standard uncertainty 9.2 parts per million) with data measured earlier
    at low temperatures (21 K to 27 K, k<sub>LT</sub> = 1.380 657 × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>,
    15.9 parts per million) has yielded a value of k = 1.380 655 × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>
    with uncertainty of 7.9 parts per million.</p>"
