  content: "<p>This paper reports on work to improve mass stability when transferring
    platinum/iridium, stainless steel and silicon artefacts between air and vacuum
    using inert gas (argon) as a transfer/storage medium. Work is underway to redefine
    the kilogram in terms of a fundamental constant of nature and this will involve
    realizing a kilogram in vacuum. The development of an effective traceability link
    to this kilogram in vacuum is therefore essential for dissemination of the mass
    scale in the future. The work reported here investigates the effect of cycling
    artefacts between air and vacuum compared with cycling artefacts between argon
    and vacuum. Additionally, the effect of transferring artefacts between short-term
    storage in air compared with short term-storage in argon is investigated. The
    results presented demonstrate improved stability in the artefacts that are transferred
    between storage in argon and vacuum compared with those that are transferred between
    storage in air and vacuum.</p>"
