abstract:
- content: "<p>As they are light, thin, rollable, break-resistant, and have fewer
    limitations on space, flexible components, especially flexible displays, are highly
    attractive for next generation electronic products. Curved is the most common
    shape for current flexible products. Two methods for measuring the luminance distribution
    of curved surface sources are investigated in this paper, including the theoretical
    analysis, numerical simulation, experiment and uncertainty analysis. The luminance
    measurement results of flexible sources not only depend on the photometric characteristics
    of the sources themselves, but also depend on the measurement method, such as
    the setting of the measuring instrument and the measurement position. The results
    of numerical simulation show that the more the source is unlike a Lambertian source
    or the smaller the curvature of the source, the greater the effect of the measurement
    method on the measurement results. Theoretically, the luminance distribution from
    one measurement method can be estimated from the other method by multiplying by
    conversion factors. An experiment is performed to verify the possibility of converting
    and also verify the correction of the theoretical analysis. For precise luminance
    measurement, position alignment is the key factor to reduce the uncertainty. Unlike
    with flat surface sources, the luminance measurement result for a curved surface
    source is strongly dependent on the measurement conditions. The currently documented
    standards for evaluating the optical performance of a flat surface source may
    not be appropriate for a flexible surface source. It is necessary to refine a
    new measurement provision to help the manufacturers utilize the appropriate metrology.</p>"
