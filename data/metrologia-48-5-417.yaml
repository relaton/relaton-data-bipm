abstract:
- content: "<p>One of the standard methods used to measure the size of nanoparticles
    in aqueous solutions in situ is dynamic light scattering (DLS). The principle
    of this technique used to measure the real size of nanoparticles in a solution
    is the use of a procedure that extrapolates the apparent diffusion coefficients
    at different scattering angles and the sample concentration to infinite conditions.
    The uncertainty in the measurement is related to the extrapolating procedure used,
    and we have evaluated this for nanoparticles with diameters in the range 20 nm
    to 100 nm using the methods described in the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement. The size of nanoparticles measured using DLS was compared with
    that obtained using a microscopic method, a cryo-transmission electron microscope,
    to check the reliability of the results obtained from the DLS measurements, which
    showed good agreement within the uncertainty levels evaluated.</p>"
