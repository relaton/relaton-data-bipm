  content: "<p>One of the standard methods used to measure the size of nanoparticles
    in aqueous solutions <italic>in situ</italic> is dynamic light scattering (DLS).
    The principle of this technique used to measure the real size of nanoparticles
    in a solution is the use of a procedure that extrapolates the apparent diffusion
    coefficients at different scattering angles and the sample concentration to infinite
    conditions. The uncertainty in the measurement is related to the extrapolating
    procedure used, and we have evaluated this for nanoparticles with diameters in
    the range 20 nm to 100 nm using the methods described in the ISO <italic>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>. The size of nanoparticles
    measured using DLS was compared with that obtained using a microscopic method,
    a cryo-transmission electron microscope, to check the reliability of the results
    obtained from the DLS measurements, which showed good agreement within the uncertainty
    levels evaluated.</p>"
