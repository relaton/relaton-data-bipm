abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurement of nanometre-sized aerosol particles is based on particle
    number concentration measurements. The commonly used method for providing traceability
    for these measurements involves charging and electrical counting of aerosol particles.
    This method requires that the particles are singly charged or that the average
    charge is exactly known, neither of which is easy to ensure. In the device called
    a single charged aerosol reference (SCAR), the fraction of multiply charged particles
    is minimal due to the novel operating principle of electrical charging and subsequent
    growth. In this study the SCAR was validated as a primary particle number concentration
    standard. The average charge of the output aerosol was evaluated for the whole
    operational particle size range. For this, the effect of the size distribution
    of the primary nanoaerosol and the output number concentration on the fraction
    of doubly charged and neutral particles was measured. It was found that the uncertainty
    caused by assuming singly charged particles is only 0.16%. A full uncertainty
    analysis was carried out for a condensation particle counter (CPC) calibration.
    According to the results, the relative expanded uncertainty of calibration was
    3.0%. This represents a typical uncertainty level achieved in CPC calibrations
    performed with SCAR. As a result of this study, SCAR was validated as a particle
    number concentration standard suitable for traceable calibration of particle counting
    instruments in the particle size range from 10 nm to 500 nm.</p>"
