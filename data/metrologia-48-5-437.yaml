  content: '<p>In the paper by Rothleitner and Francis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

    <bold>48</bold> 187–95</ext-link>) the correction due to the finite speed of light
    in absolute gravimeters is analysed from the viewpoint of special relativity.
    The relativistic concepts eventually lead to the two classical approaches to the
    problem: analysis of the beat frequency, and introduction of the retarded times.
    In the first approach, an additional time delay has to be assumed, because the
    frequency of the beam bounced from the accelerated reflector differs at the point
    of reflection from that at the point of interference. The retarded times formalism
    is equivalent to a single Doppler shift, but results in the same correction as
    the beat frequency approach, even though the latter explicitly combines two Doppler
    shifts. In our comments we discuss these and other problems we found with the
    suggested treatment of the correction.</p>'
