abstract:
- content: "<p>In the paper by Rothleitner and Francis (2011 Metrologia 48 187–95)
    the correction due to the finite speed of light in absolute gravimeters is analysed
    from the viewpoint of special relativity. The relativistic concepts eventually
    lead to the two classical approaches to the problem: analysis of the beat frequency,
    and introduction of the retarded times. In the first approach, an additional time
    delay has to be assumed, because the frequency of the beam bounced from the accelerated
    reflector differs at the point of reflection from that at the point of interference.
    The retarded times formalism is equivalent to a single Doppler shift, but results
    in the same correction as the beat frequency approach, even though the latter
    explicitly combines two Doppler shifts. In our comments we discuss these and other
    problems we found with the suggested treatment of the correction.</p>"
