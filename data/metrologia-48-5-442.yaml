abstract:
- content: "<p>In reply to the comment by Nagornyi et al we show that the introduction
    of a time delay after the application of a relativistic Doppler shift, as proposed
    by the authors, is equivalent to an introduction of a time dilation into the reference
    beam. This would partly cancel the effect of the Doppler shifts. We conclude that
    the introduction of such an additional time delay is incorrect.</p>"
