  content: "<p>In reply to the comment by Nagornyi <italic>et al</italic> we show
    that the introduction of a time delay after the application of a relativistic
    Doppler shift, as proposed by the authors, is equivalent to an introduction of
    a time dilation into the reference beam. This would partly cancel the effect of
    the Doppler shifts. We conclude that the introduction of such an additional time
    delay is incorrect.</p>"
