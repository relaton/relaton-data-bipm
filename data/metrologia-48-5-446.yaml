  content: <p>We discuss the treatment of distributed cavity phase, microwave lensing
    and microwave leakage in the paper by Ovchinnikov and Marra (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

    <bold>48</bold> 87–100</ext-link>). The paper neglects the potential distributed
    cavity phase shifts from linear phase gradients and quadrupolar phase variations.
    Only azimuthally symmetric phase variations were analysed and an incorrect model
    was used for these. The paper also omits an uncertainty due to microwave lensing,
    which must be included. Finally, we describe additional measurements that could
    clarify the model used to analyse the frequency shifts due to microwave leakage.</p>
