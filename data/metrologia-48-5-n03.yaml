abstract:
- content: "<p>We discuss the treatment of distributed cavity phase, microwave lensing
    and microwave leakage in the paper by Ovchinnikov and Marra (2011 Metrologia 48
    87–100). The paper neglects the potential distributed cavity phase shifts from
    linear phase gradients and quadrupolar phase variations. Only azimuthally symmetric
    phase variations were analysed and an incorrect model was used for these. The
    paper also omits an uncertainty due to microwave lensing, which must be included.
    Finally, we describe additional measurements that could clarify the model used
    to analyse the frequency shifts due to microwave leakage.</p>"
