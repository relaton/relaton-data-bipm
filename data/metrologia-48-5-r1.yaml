abstract:
- content: "<p>The most widely used method for the preparation of primary standard
    gas mixtures involves weighing the individual components into a cylinder. We present
    a new mathematical description of the method and its uncertainties. We use this
    to demonstrate how strategies for serial dilution can be identified that minimize
    the uncertainty in the final mixture and show how they can be implemented practically.
    We review published reports of high accuracy gravimetry and give examples of relative
    uncertainties in the composition of standards approaching 1 part-per-million in
    the best cases and in the range of 100 to 1000 parts-per-million more typically.</p>"
