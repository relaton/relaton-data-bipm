abstract:
- content: "<p>The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) has consultative
    committees covering various areas of metrology. The Consultative Committee for
    Ionizing Radiation (CCRI) differs from the others in having three sections: Section
    (I) deals with radiation dosimetry, Section (II) with radionuclide metrology and
    Section (III) with neutron metrology. In 2003 a proposal was made to publish special
    issues of Metrologia covering the work of the three Sections. Section (II) was
    the first to complete their task, and their special issue was published in 2007,
    volume 44(4). This was followed in 2009 by the special issue on radiation dosimetry,
    volume 46(2). The present issue, volume 48(6), completes the trilogy and attempts
    to explain neutron metrology, the youngest of the three disciplines, the neutron
    only having been discovered in 1932, to a wider audience and to highlight the
    relevance and importance of this field.</p><p>When originally approached with
    the idea of this special issue, Section (III) immediately saw the value of a publication
    specifically on neutron metrology. It is a topic area where papers tend to be
    scattered throughout the literature in journals covering, for example, nuclear
    instrumentation, radiation protection or radiation measurements in general. Review
    articles tend to be few. People new to the field often ask for an introduction
    to the various topics. There are some excellent older textbooks, but these are
    now becoming obsolete. More experienced workers in specific areas of neutron metrology
    can find it difficult to know the latest position in related areas. The papers
    in this issue attempt, without presenting a purely historical outline, to describe
    the field in a sufficiently logical way to provide the novice with a clear introduction,
    while being sufficiently up-to-date to provide the more experienced reader with
    the latest scientific developments in the different topic areas.</p><p>Neutron
    radiation fields obviously occur throughout the nuclear industry, from the initial
    fuel enrichment and fabrication processes right through to storage or reprocessing,
    and neutron metrology is clearly important in this area. Neutron fields do, however,
    occur in other areas, for example where neutron sources are used in oil well logging
    and moisture measurements. They also occur around high energy accelerators, including
    photon linear accelerators used for cancer therapy, and are expected to be a more
    serious problem around the new hadron radiation therapy facilities. Roughly 50%
    of the cosmic ray doses experienced by fliers at the flight altitudes of commercial
    aircraft are due to neutrons. Current research on fusion presents neutron metrology
    with a whole new range of challenges because of the very high fluences expected.</p><p>One
    of the most significant features of neutron fields is the very wide range of possible
    neutron energies. In the nuclear industry, for example, neutrons occur with energies
    from those of thermal neutrons at a few meV to the upper end of the fission spectrum
    at perhaps 10 MeV. For cosmic ray dosimetry the energy range extends into the
    GeV region. This enormous range sets a challenge for designing measuring devices
    and a parallel challenge of developing measurement standards for characterizing
    these devices.</p><p>One of the major considerations when deciding on topics for
    this special issue was agreeing on what not to include. Modelling, i.e. the use
    of radiation transport codes, is now a very important aspect of neutron measurements.
    These calculations are vital for shielding and for instrument design; nevertheless,
    the topic has only been included here where it has a direct bearing on metrology
    and the development of standards. Neutron spectrometry is an increasingly important
    technique for unravelling some of the problems of dose equivalent measurements
    and for plasma diagnostics in fusion research. However, this topic is at least
    one step removed from primary metrology and so it was felt that it should not
    be covered, particularly as a compendium of papers on spectrometry for radiation
    protection has been published relatively recently [1]. The CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (CIPM MRA), whereby national measurement standards and certificates
    issued by different national metrology institutes (NMIs) can be recognized internationally,
    is covered only briefly, although the key comparisons which underpin the CIPM
    MRA are highlighted.</p><p>The papers included in this issue concentrate on the
    primary physical quantities—neutron source emission rate and neutron fluence,
    papers on the latter quantity covering the wide range of neutron energies for
    which standards are required. Neutron cross sections are fundamental to neutron
    physics and their importance in neutron metrology is also covered.</p><p>A large
    amount of work by acknowledged experts in neutron metrology has gone into the
    preparation of this special issue and we are indebted to them for their time and
    effort. The list of contributors begins with the authors of the papers but also
    includes the referees who provided invisible but invaluable input. We are grateful
    for the support and encouragement of Professor Georgio Moscati, president of the
    CCRI when the work was proposed, Dr Kim Carneiro the current president, and Dr
    Penny Allisy-Roberts the executive secretary of the CCRI.</p><p>When this work
    was first proposed a list of potential topics was drawn up by the then chairman
    of Section (III) Dr Horst Klein. It is a measure of his insight and knowledge
    of the field that the resulting document matches almost exactly the original plan
    he drew up. This special issue is thus a tribute to his very extensive contribution
    to the field. We sincerely hope its contents provide an accurate picture of the
    present state of neutron metrology in view of Dr Klein's conviction of the importance
    in metrology of getting things right.</p><p>Reference</p><p>[1] Thomas D J and
