abstract:
- content: "<p>In some branches of metrology the quantity, or quantities, to be measured
    and the requirements for standards of this quantity, or these quantities, are
    clear-cut, although the accuracies required may not always be obvious. Good examples
    are time, length and mass. The quantities measured in neutron metrology and the
    requirements and uses of these quantities are less well known. This paper lays
    the foundation for subsequent more detailed discussions of the problems and issues
    faced by national metrology institutes when developing and providing standards.</p>"
