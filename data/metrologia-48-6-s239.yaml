  content: "<p>Radionuclide neutron sources are of fundamental importance to neutron
    metrology. They are the reference standards which allow quantities such as neutron
    fluence and neutron dose equivalent to be realized in laboratories around the
    world. In order to do this it is essential that the sources themselves are well
    characterized in terms of neutron emission rate, emission anisotropy and spectral
    fluence Φ<sub>E</sub> of emitted neutrons. A summary of the types of radionuclide
    neutron sources is given followed by detailed descriptions of the primary standardization
    techniques in use today, focusing on the manganese bath technique. Methods for
    determining the anisotropy of emission are discussed, followed by a brief description
    of the spectral fluence of the different source types. Finally, an overview of
    international comparison exercises in this area is included.</p>"
