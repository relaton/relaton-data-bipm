abstract:
- content: "<p>Over the 50-year history of Section III (Neutron Measurements) of the
    Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation of the International Committee for
    Weights and Measures, only a single interlaboratory comparison of thermal neutron
    measurements has been completed, although a new comparison of this kind is in
    progress at the time of this writing. The initial comparison was perhaps considered
    to have demonstrated a sufficient degree of agreement that its repetition was
    not of particularly urgent priority. Thermal neutron measurements are indeed an
    old and well-developed field, as is seen in the many references cited in this
    paper. This paper describes briefly the production of thermal neutron fields from
    fast neutron sources, the moderation of neutron spectra towards thermal equilibrium,
    various conventions for describing thermal neutron fields, corrections for self-absorption
    and scattering in detector materials and the selection of detectors based on established
    thermal neutron cross-section standards.</p>"
