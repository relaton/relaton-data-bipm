  content: "<p>Monoenergetic neutron reference fields are required for the investigation
    of the energy-dependent response and the calibration of neutron detectors and
    dosemeters for various applications ranging from nuclear physics and nuclear data
    measurements to radiation protection. In a series of two separate publications
    the metrological aspects of the production and the measurement of fast neutrons
    are reviewed. In this first part, requirements for the nuclear reaction used to
    produce the neutron field as well as methods for target characterization and the
    general layout of reference facilities are discussed. The second part will focus
    on the most important techniques for field characterization. This includes the
    determination of the neutron fluence as well as the spectral neutron distribution
    and the determination of the fluence of contaminating photons.</p>"
