abstract:
- content: "<p>Monoenergetic neutron reference fields are required for the calibration
    of neutron detectors and dosemeters for various applications ranging from nuclear
    physics and nuclear data measurements to radiation protection. In a series of
    two separate publications the metrological aspects of the production and measurement
    of fast neutrons are reviewed. In the first part, requirements for the nuclear
    reactions used to produce neutron fields as well as methods for target characterization
    and the general layout of reference facilities were discussed. This second part
    focuses on the most important techniques for field characterization and includes
    the determination of the neutron fluence as well as the spectral neutron distribution
    and the determination of the fluence of contaminating photons. The measurements
    are usually carried out relative to reference cross sections which are reviewed
    in a separate contribution, but for certain conditions ‘absolute’ methods for
    neutron measurements can be used which are directly traceable to the international
    system of units (SI).</p>"
