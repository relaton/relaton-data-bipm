abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper provides an overview of high-energy quasi-monoenergetic
    neutron sources and facilities above 20 MeV around the world. Various technical
    matters are discussed which are required in characterizing the neutron fields
    by spectrometry, fluence and beam profile measurements. Important topics regarding
    the calibration of neutron detectors are also introduced with emphasis on beam
    monitoring, tail correction, background subtraction and fluence-to-dose conversion.
    Efforts to standardize the high-energy neutron fluence in Japan and by the German
    national metrology institute in collaboration with Belgian and South African institutions
    are also presented.</p>"
