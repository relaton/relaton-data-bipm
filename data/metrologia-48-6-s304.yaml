  content: "<p>The use of simulated workplace neutron fields, which aim at replicating
    radiation fields at practical workplaces, is an alternative solution for the calibration
    of neutron dosemeters. They offer more appropriate calibration coefficients when
    the mean fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion coefficients of the simulated and
    practical fields are comparable. Intensive Monte Carlo modelling work has become
    quite indispensable for the design and/or the characterization of the produced
    mixed neutron/photon fields, and the use of Bonner sphere systems and proton recoil
    spectrometers is also mandatory for a reliable experimental determination of the
    neutron fluence energy distribution over the whole energy range. The establishment
    of a calibration capability with a simulated workplace neutron field is not an
    easy task; to date only few facilities are available as standard calibration fields.</p>"
