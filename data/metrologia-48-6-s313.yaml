  content: "<p>The calibration of a neutron-sensitive device can range from a simple
    calibration factor at a single energy or energy distribution to a full response
    characterization over the entire energy range to which the device is sensitive.
    As the responses of neutron-sensitive devices and the fluence-to-dose-equivalent
    conversion coefficients can vary with neutron energy and incident angle, both
    simulation and experiments in standard neutron fields are required. Although several
    ISO standards present calibration principles in general and detailed discussion
    on many specific areas, there are certain omissions and limitations that this
    paper intends to highlight, along with some new recommendations derived from the
    recent literature, mainly focused on the effective centre, corrections for geometry
    and neutron scattering, as well as the problem of calibrating in terms of personal
    dose equivalent.</p>"
