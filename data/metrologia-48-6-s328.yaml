  content: "<p>The measurement of a neutron cross section can be simplified if it
    is measured relative to a neutron cross section standard. Then it is not necessary
    to measure the neutron fluence. The standards in effect provide determinations
    of the neutron fluence. These standards are not defined standards but instead
    working standards. As such it is important to make measurements to improve the
    quality of the standards. Also better techniques for evaluating the standards
    must be promoted. The history of the evaluation process for the standards is discussed
    from the first rather primitive one to the latest very sophisticated evaluation
    that was an international cooperative effort. An overview of the main detectors
    used for applications of the standards is given.</p>"
