abstract:
- content: "<p>During the monitoring of the long term stability of two accelerometers
    intended for use in the CIPM key comparison CCAUV.V-K2, significant deviations
    of the magnitude results of the single-ended transducer were discovered. These
    deviations depend on whether the calibration was performed on an armature made
    of beryllium or of ceramic. After first investigations which led to an interpretation
    as a relative motion effect published in Täubner et al (2010 Metrologia 47 58–64),
    now, more detailed measurements combined with modelling and system identification
    have led to a better understanding of what is happening. The measurements, model
    considerations and corresponding results are presented and discussed in order
    to further the understanding of this important issue of primary accelerometer
    calibration. This contribution can be considered a sequel to the former publication
    (Täubner et al 2010 Metrologia 47 58–64) on the topic.</p>"
