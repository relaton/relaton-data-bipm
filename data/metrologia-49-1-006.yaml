abstract:
- content: "<p>Investigating accurately the acoustic behaviour of small fluid-filled
    cavities and ducts and their association is a problem of persistent importance,
    because nowadays both experimental investigations and theoretical modelling must
    provide results of increasingly higher precision. The motivation here is provided
    mainly by the acoustic measurement tools used for both the calibration of microphones
    and the artificial ear (IEC 60318-1). Both improved analytical models of small
    acoustic components (small tubes and slits), which account for the effects of
    the viscous and thermal boundary layers accurately in the frequency range of interest
    (20 Hz to 20 kHz), and experimental characterization of their input impedances
    (with a relative uncertainty of the order of magnitude of 10<sup>−2</sup>) have
    been proposed recently (Rodrigues et al 2008 J. Sound Vib. 315 890–910). Existing
    analytical procedures for coupled components suffer from strong approximations
    at the interfaces between narrow tubes and slits or other elements as well as
    the open space. A dedicated numerical model can be used in order to investigate
    accurately the acoustic field at these interfaces. The numerical model presented
    in the paper relies on a suitable linear exact formulation, based upon two coupled
    equations involving particle velocity and temperature variation (Joly 2010 Acta
    Acust. United Acust. 96 102–14) and utilizes an adaptive anisotropic meshing technique
    to model correctly the strong variations which occur around the geometrical discontinuities
    and inside the boundary layers. Application to a 2D axisymmetrical device (annular
    slit ending in an aperture in an infinite screen) is considered to present the
    ability of the method. Acoustic pressure, temperature variation and particle velocity
    distributions inside and around the end of the slit are depicted, and the input
    acoustic admittance of the slit obtained numerically is compared with both experimental
    and analytical results available.</p>"
