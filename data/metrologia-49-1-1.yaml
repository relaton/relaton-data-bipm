abstract:
- content: "<p>The modelling of electrical connections of single, or several, multiterminal
    quantum Hall effect (QHE) devices is relevant for electrical metrology: it is
    known, in fact, that certain particular connections allow (i) the realization
    of multiples or fractions of the quantized resistance, or (ii) the rejection of
    stray impedances, so that the configuration maintains the status of quantum standard.
    Ricketts–Kemeny and Delahaye equivalent circuits are known to be accurate models
    of the QHE: however, the numerical or analytical solution of electrical networks
    including these equivalent circuits can be difficult. In this paper, we introduce
    a method of analysis based on the representation of a QHE device by means of the
    indefinite admittance matrix: external connections are then represented with another
    matrix, easily written by inspection. Some examples, including the solution of
    double- and triple-series connections, are shown.</p>"
