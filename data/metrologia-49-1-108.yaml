abstract:
- content: "<p>Measurements made with watt balances are paving the way to a new definition
    of the kilogram based upon a fixed value of the Planck constant. The Bureau International
    des Poids et Measures (BIPM) are developing a simultaneous moving and weighing
    variant of the watt balance technique, which requires a superconducting coil to
    reach its ultimate uncertainty. The BIPM technique has the advantage that it eliminates
    the requirement for extreme stability in the magnetic field employed by conventional
    watt balances, but requires cryogenic operation of parts of the balance to achieve
    a low uncertainty.</p><p>This paper proposes a simple method, by which the BIPM
    technique can be made to operate at room temperature with no loss of accuracy.
    The superconducting coil is replaced by a bifilar coil and the measurement procedure
    is modified to eliminate any inequality between the two conductors in the bifilar
    coil. The new technique is not subject to the many secondary sources of uncertainty
    arising from cryogenic operation.</p>"
