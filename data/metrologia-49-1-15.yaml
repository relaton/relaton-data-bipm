abstract:
- content: "<p>Counting is at the base of many high-level measurements, such as, for
    example, frequency measurements. In some instances the measurand itself is a number
    of events, such as spontaneous decays in activity measurements, or objects, such
    as colonies of bacteria in microbiology. Countings also play a fundamental role
    in everyday life. In any case, a counting is a measurement. A measurement result,
    according to its present definition, as given in the ‘International Vocabulary
    of Metrology—Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)’, must include
    a specification concerning the estimated uncertainty. As concerns measurements
    by counting, this specification is not easy to encompass in the well-known framework
    of the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’, known as GUM,
    in which there is no guidance on the topic. Furthermore, the issue of uncertainty
    in countings has received little or no attention in the literature, so that it
    is commonly accepted that this category of measurements constitutes an exception
    in which the concept of uncertainty is not applicable, or, alternatively, that
    results of measurements by counting have essentially no uncertainty. In this paper
    we propose a general model for measurements by counting which allows an uncertainty
    evaluation compliant with the general framework of the GUM.</p>"
