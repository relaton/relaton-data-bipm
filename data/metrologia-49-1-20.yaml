abstract:
- content: "<p>We consider an estimation problem described in the Guide to the Expression
    of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). The problem is concerned with estimating
    a measurand that is a non-linear function of input quantities. The GUM describes
    two methods for estimating the measurandâ€”method 1 is based on the same non-linear
    function of input-quantity estimates and method 2 is based on the mean of that
    function of individual measurements. We use several examples to compare the two
    methods based on their mean-squared errors and to demonstrate that a uniformly
    preferred method may not be available except for the simplest cases. We also consider
    an approach based on the Monte Carlo method in Supplement 1 of the GUM for the
    problem and compare it with the two methods.</p>"
