  content: "<p>We consider an estimation problem described in the <italic>Guide to
    the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic> (GUM). The problem is concerned
    with estimating a measurand that is a non-linear function of input quantities.
    The GUM describes two methods for estimating the measurandâ€”method 1 is based on
    the same non-linear function of input-quantity estimates and method 2 is based
    on the mean of that function of individual measurements. We use several examples
    to compare the two methods based on their mean-squared errors and to demonstrate
    that a uniformly preferred method may not be available except for the simplest
    cases. We also consider an approach based on the Monte Carlo method in <italic>Supplement</italic>
    1 of the GUM for the problem and compare it with the two methods.</p>"
