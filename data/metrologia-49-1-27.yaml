  content: "<p>During the monitoring of the long term stability of two accelerometers
    intended for use in the CIPM key comparison CCAUV.V-K2, significant deviations
    of the magnitude results of the single-ended transducer were discovered. These
    deviations depend on whether the calibration was performed on an armature made
    of beryllium or of ceramic. After first investigations which led to an interpretation
    as a relative motion effect published in Täubner <italic>et al</italic> (2010
    <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>47</bold> 58–64), now, more detailed measurements
    combined with modelling and system identification have led to a better understanding
    of what is happening. The measurements, model considerations and corresponding
    results are presented and discussed in order to further the understanding of this
    important issue of primary accelerometer calibration. This contribution can be
    considered a sequel to the former publication (Täubner <italic>et al</italic>
    2010 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>47</bold> 58–64) on the topic.</p>"
