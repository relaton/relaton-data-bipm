  content: "<p>Investigating accurately the acoustic behaviour of small fluid-filled
    cavities and ducts and their association is a problem of persistent importance,
    because nowadays both experimental investigations and theoretical modelling must
    provide results of increasingly higher precision. The motivation here is provided
    mainly by the acoustic measurement tools used for both the calibration of microphones
    and the artificial ear (IEC 60318-1). Both improved analytical models of small
    acoustic components (small tubes and slits), which account for the effects of
    the viscous and thermal boundary layers accurately in the frequency range of interest
    (20 Hz to 20 kHz), and experimental characterization of their input impedances
    (with a relative uncertainty of the order of magnitude of 10<sup>−2</sup>) have
    been proposed recently (Rodrigues <italic>et al</italic> 2008 <italic>J. Sound
    Vib.</italic> <bold>315</bold> 890–910). Existing analytical procedures for coupled
    components suffer from strong approximations at the interfaces between narrow
    tubes and slits or other elements as well as the open space. A dedicated numerical
    model can be used in order to investigate accurately the acoustic field at these
    interfaces. The numerical model presented in the paper relies on a suitable linear
    exact formulation, based upon two coupled equations involving particle velocity
    and temperature variation (Joly 2010 <italic>Acta Acust. United Acust.</italic>
    <bold>96</bold> 102–14) and utilizes an adaptive anisotropic meshing technique
    to model correctly the strong variations which occur around the geometrical discontinuities
    and inside the boundary layers. Application to a 2D axisymmetrical device (annular
    slit ending in an aperture in an infinite screen) is considered to present the
    ability of the method. Acoustic pressure, temperature variation and particle velocity
    distributions inside and around the end of the slit are depicted, and the input
    acoustic admittance of the slit obtained numerically is compared with both experimental
    and analytical results available.</p>"
