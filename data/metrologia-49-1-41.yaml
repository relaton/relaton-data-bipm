abstract:
- content: "<p>High precision levelling is an indispensable method used to monitor
    benchmark and terrain stability at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM). Associated with the International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG),
    levelling measurements were carried out repeatedly over the past decades. A local
    gravity field strongly depends on vertical terrain deformation. 1 cm displacement
    implies about 2 µGal change in the vertical gravity acceleration. The precision
    of absolute and relative gravimetry nowadays is about 1 µGal.</p><p>At the beginning
    of the century, a strategy was outlined that the ICAG should be upgraded to a
    metrological Key Comparison of the CIPM MRA (Mutual Recognition Arrangement) recognized
    officially by the designated governmental organizations. As a result of this decision,
    BIPM site B was constructed and completed in Spring 2001. The site B pillar is
    4 m × 6 m × 1.5 m in dimension and more than 80 ton in weight. Such a large, newly
    built concrete body produces local deformation due to its sinking or tilting.
    This in turn influences the local gravity field. Rigorous levelling measurements
    have been performed by the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM),
    France, since 2001 and repeated together with the 4-year ICAGs of 2001, 2005 and
    2009. ICAG-2009 was characterized by becoming the first Comité International des
    Poids et Mesures (CIPM) Key Comparison which supported meanwhile the BIPM watt
    balance (WB) project. The WB pillar was built in Spring 2009. The Institut Géographique
    National (IGN), France, has hence been invited to participate in the levelling.
    The latter also measured the link between the BIPM local network and external
    stations of the French national height reference system IGN69.</p><p>In this paper,
    we report the final results of the levelling programmes of 2001, 2005 and 2009
    and compare the results. We investigate stability of the BIPM gravity-levelling
    stations. We conclude that the existing and the newly built stations can be considered
    as stable for the purposes of the ICAGs and the WB, although further repeat measurement
    may be required for the WB site.</p><p>For the first time, detailed and complete
    levelling data and results are publishedOnly the final result of the 2005 levelling
    mission was published in [4] where, instead of NGF, the height reference system
    used was IGN69. This is incorrect and is corrected in this paper.. After 30 years
    of organizing and holding eight ICAGs, the BIPM will hand over the KC ICAG-2013
    to another CIPM MRA designated institute. This paper serves as a technical and
    historical report of precision levelling, a sub-task of the ICAGs.</p>"
