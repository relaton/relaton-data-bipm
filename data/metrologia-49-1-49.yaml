abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper we present a new prediction algorithm for the generation
    of International Atomic Time (TAI). The new prediction algorithm takes into account
    the frequency drift which affects most of the participating atomic clocks. In
    particular, we focus on the effect of the application of the new model on the
    prediction term for the frequency drift affecting the free atomic time scale (EAL).
    We also present its effect on TAI performance and on atomic clock weights.</p>"
