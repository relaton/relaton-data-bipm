abstract:
- content: "<p>Amount of substance is one of the base quantities that form the International
    System of units. The quantity measures the size of an ensemble of elementary entities,
    such as atoms, molecules, electrons and other particles. In order to count atoms
    with a relative uncertainty of better than 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, here we formulate
    the amount of substance measurement homogeneity principle. A consequence of this
    principle is that the accuracy of a measurement of amount of substance is limited
    by the homogeneity of the sample. We propose a criterion of sample preparation
    for the accurate determination of molar mass which is to ensure complete chemical
    conversions, no fractionation, homogeneity at the molecular level and less contamination.
    Based on this philosophy, a more accurate molar mass of natural single crystal
    silicon was achieved. We found that there was an isotope fractionation in the
    preparation process of the NaOH solution method. It led to an Avogadro constant
    value 1.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup> lower. The corrected value is higher than previous
    data, and compatible with recent values of the Planck constant.</p>"
