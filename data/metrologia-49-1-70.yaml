  content: "<p>Measurements of forces less than a micronewton are critical when examining
    the mechanical behaviour of materials and devices at characteristic length scales
    below a micrometre. As a result, specification standards for nanomechanical tests
    and test equipment are being proposed by international standards organizations,
    and an infrastructure for traceable small force calibration is developing. In
    this context, results are reported from the first interlaboratory comparison of
    micronewton-level force metrology. The basis of the comparison was the calibration
    of a set of five piezoresistive cantilever force sensors similar to those used
    for atomic force microscopes but employed here as transfer artefacts. The artefacts
    were circulated among four national metrology institutes with each using their
    own force balance to calibrate the stiffness (force change per unit displacement)
    and sensitivity (signal output change per unit force) of the artefacts. By considering
    the weighted mean of the stiffness and sensitivity values reported for a given
    artefact, reference values were obtained. The largest contributing uncertainty
    components were due to the transfer artefacts themselves, rather than from the
    measurements of the physical quantities of force, voltage and displacement. The
    results imply that it should be possible to determine cantilever stiffness using
    force balance techniques with an accuracy of better than 1% if necessary, but
    that improvements in the ability to orient the transfer artefacts, to characterize
    the non-linearity of their output, and to compensate for the stiffness of the
    associated fixtures and load frames are required if the resolution of future comparisons
    is to improve.</p>"
