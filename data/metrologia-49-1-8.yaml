abstract:
- content: "<p>The Electron Counting Capacitance Standard currently pursued at PTB
    aims to close the Quantum Metrological Triangle with a final precision of a few
    parts in 10<sup>7</sup>. This paper reports the considerable progress recently
    achieved with a new generation of single-electron tunnelling devices. A five-junction
    R-pump was operated with a relative charge transfer error of five electrons in
    10<sup>7</sup>, and was used to successfully perform single-electron charging
    of a cryogenic capacitor. The preliminary result for the single-electron charge
    quantum has an uncertainty of less than two parts in 10<sup>6</sup> and is consistent
    with the value of the elementary charge.</p>"
