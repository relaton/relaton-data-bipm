abstract:
- content: "<p>Five iron–carbon (Fe–C) eutectic fixed-point cells have been constructed
    between NPL and LNE-Cnam to investigate the robustness and to measure the agreement
    of their melting temperatures. Each cell was constructed with a different selection
    of materials sourced by NPL and LNE-Cnam. The measured emfs at the Fe–C fixed-point
    temperature (∼1153 °C), compared between cells, agree within around 1.98 µV (∼90 mK),
    where the most important contribution to the uncertainty of each measurement is
    the inhomogeneity associated with the measuring Pt/Pd thermocouple. This demonstrates
    that these cells are suitable for use as secondary fixed-point cells in contact
    thermometry but the robustness of the presented cells is not found to be sufficient
    for maintaining their integrity during repeated cycling procedures.</p>"
