abstract:
- content: "<p>The 8th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG-2009)
    and the associated Relative Gravity Campaign (RGC2009) took place at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) between July and October 2009. Altogether
    24 institutes with 22 absolute gravimeters and 9 relative gravimeters participated
    in the ICAG/RGC campaign. Accurate absolute and relative gravity measurements
    as well as precision levelling measurements were performed on the micro-gravity
    3D-grid at the BIPM.</p><p>The 2009 comparison was the first to be organized as
    a Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) metrological Key Comparison
    under the CIPM MRA (Mutual Recognition Arrangement), which means that the result
    will be officially recognized by the governmental organizations responsible. As
    a consequence, the relative gravimeters employed were carefully selected and the
    measurement schedules were rigorously enforced compared with earlier campaigns.
    Thus the quality of the RGC2009 and the determination of the BIPM local gravity
    network were improved.</p><p>After 30 years and eight successive ICAGs, the BIPM
    has decided to transfer its role to the national metrological institutes, although
    the CIPM will continue to organize the key comparison as ICAGs. The background
    to the RGC2009, and the organization, data processing and final results of the
    gravity and vertical gravity gradients, are presented in this paper. This report
    is more detailed than previous final reports of the RGCs.</p>"
