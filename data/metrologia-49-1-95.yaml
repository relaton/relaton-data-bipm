    <p>The 8th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG-2009) and the associated Relative Gravity Campaign (RGC2009) took place at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) between July and October 2009. Altogether 24 institutes with 22 absolute gravimeters and 9 relative gravimeters participated in the ICAG/RGC campaign. Accurate absolute and relative gravity measurements as well as precision levelling measurements were performed on the micro-gravity 3D-grid at the BIPM.</p>
    <p>The 2009 comparison was the first to be organized as a Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) metrological Key Comparison under the CIPM MRA (Mutual Recognition Arrangement), which means that the result will be officially recognized by the governmental organizations responsible. As a consequence, the relative gravimeters employed were carefully selected and the measurement schedules were rigorously enforced compared with earlier campaigns. Thus the quality of the RGC2009 and the determination of the BIPM local gravity network were improved.</p>
    <p>After 30 years and eight successive ICAGs, the BIPM has decided to transfer its role to the national metrological institutes, although the CIPM will continue to organize the key comparison as ICAGs. The background to the RGC2009, and the organization, data processing and final results of the gravity and vertical gravity gradients, are presented in this paper. This report is more detailed than previous final reports of the RGCs.</p>
