abstract:
- content: "<p>In a previous paper (2011 Metrologia 48 L7–11) we have calculated a
    reference prior for a calibration model where a state-of-knowledge distribution
    of the coefficients of the calibration function is provided. Observed values of
    the response for a fixed value of the stimulus are also available. They are assumed
    to conform to a Gaussian probability distribution of unknown standard deviation.
    The calculation of the reference prior is revised here using a different sequence
    of subsets of the parameter space. This choice is preferable to the earlier one
    with respect to the properties of the ensuing posterior. In contrast to the former
    result the revised reference prior leads to the same posterior distribution as
    the application of Supplement 1 to the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement’.</p>"
