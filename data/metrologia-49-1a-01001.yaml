    <p>The purpose of the EURAMET supplementary comparison EURAMET.EM-S29 was to compare the calibration and measurement capabilities of the participating institutes. The pilot laboratory was the Laboratorio Central Oficial de Electrotecnia (LCOE, Madrid, Spain), and the other participants were the following other six EURAMET national metrology institutes: BIM (Bulgaria), MIKES (Finland), PTB (Germany), SP (Sweden), UME (Turkey) and VSL (The Netherlands), and the COOMET national institute VNIIMS (Russia).</p><p>A 200 kV DC reference measuring system provided by LCOE was used as a travelling reference measuring system (TRMS). The comparison measurements were carried out between November 2007 and April 2010. According to the technical protocol, two different types of measurements had to be made: determination of the assigned scale factor of the TRMS between 1 kV and 200 kV, positive and negative polarity, and short-term stability of the measuring systems used.</p><p>For each voltage level and polarity, a comparison reference value was calculated. Compatibility of each participant with the corresponding comparison reference values and between any pair of laboratories was also obtained.</p><p>Results of the comparison offered a good opportunity to check the calibration and measurement capabilities of the participants in the field of high voltage DC measurement. The reported results also demonstrate the importance of taking care in order to cancel the influence of the self-heating of the TRMS.</p><p>Main text.
