- content: |-
    <p>Within the framework of EURAMET, a comparison has been organized of measurements of self-inductance at 100 mH and 1 kHz. The comparison is identified as EUROMET.EM-S26. Two 100 mH inductance standards, encased in a thermostatic controlled enclosure, were circulated among the participants. The results from 10 out of 16 participants are in agreement with the reference values. A majority of the results agrees within ±50 µH/H. The participants reported four different methods to realize the traceability of the unit of inductance. The results from these different methods are in good agreement within the reported uncertainties. The results of this comparison have been linked to the results of the comparison EUROMET.EM-S20. The organization of this comparison has been a successful exercise of sharing the workload among four different institutes and can be an example to future comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
