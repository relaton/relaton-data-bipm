    <p>This report describes the results obtained from a NML(Ireland)–BIPM bilateral comparison of 1 Ω resistance standards in 2010. The comparison was carried out in the framework of the BIPM ongoing key comparison BIPM.EM-K13.a. Two BIPM 1 Ω travelling standards of CSIRO type were calibrated first at the BIPM, then at the NMLI and again at the BIPM after their return. The stability of the transfer standard was such that the uncertainty associated with the transfer was significantly smaller than the uncertainty arising from the calibrations. The mean difference between the NMLI and the BIPM calibrations was found to be just within the expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
