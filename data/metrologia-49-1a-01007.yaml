abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>We report the results of the international comparison of low-frequency ac voltage ratio: CCEM-K7. The participants made measurements of a unique travelling standard: an inductive voltage divider which provided the 20 ac voltage ratios chosen for the comparison. The nominal ratios chosen were: 0.1 to 0.9, 0.01 and 1/11 to 10/11. Each of the 17 participants measured the in-phase and quadrature components of all 20 ratios at a frequency of 1 kHz, and 7 laboratories made additional, optional, measurements at a frequency of 55 Hz. The report consists of two separate parts: the first part describes the comparison and provides detailed uncertainty budgets for each participant; the second part describes the method used to analyse the results, gives the results of the comparison and tabulates the raw data provided by each participant.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
