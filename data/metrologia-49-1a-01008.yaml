  content: "<p>This report presents the comparison results of dc voltage measurements
    at the 1.018 V and 10 V levels using two electronic DC reference standards performed
    by national metrology institutes in the COOMET region. This comparison provides
    an indirect link between voltage realizations of BelGIM and BIPM through VNIIM
    results obtained in voltage standard key comparisons with those of the BIPM.</p>\n<p>The
    final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the value
    assigned to a 1.018 V and a 10 V standard by the BelGIM,  <italic>U</italic><sub>BelGIM</sub>,
    and that assigned by the BIPM,  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>, which for the
    reference date is:</p>\n<p>at 1.018 V,  <italic>U</italic><sub>BelGIM</sub> −
    \ <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = −5 nV;  <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> =
    35 nV on 2011/07/27 \nat 10 V,  <italic>U</italic><sub>BelGIM</sub> −  <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>
    = −280 nV;  <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 450 nV on 2011/07/27,</p>\n<p>where
    \ <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated
    with the measured difference.\nThe results of the comparison show that there is
    a good agreement between the measurement results of the participants within their
    stated expanded uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.\n</p>\n<p><bold>Main
