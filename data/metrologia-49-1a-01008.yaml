abstract:
- content: "<p>This report presents the comparison results of dc voltage measurements
    at the 1.018 V and 10 V levels using two electronic DC reference standards performed
    by national metrology institutes in the COOMET region. This comparison provides
    an indirect link between voltage realizations of BelGIM and BIPM through VNIIM
    results obtained in voltage standard key comparisons with those of the BIPM.</p><p>The
    final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the value
    assigned to a 1.018 V and a 10 V standard by the BelGIM, U<sub>BelGIM</sub>, and
    that assigned by the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, which for the reference date is:</p><p>at
    1.018 V, U<sub>BelGIM</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = −5 nV; u<sub>c</sub> = 35 nV
    on 2011/07/27 \nat 10 V, U<sub>BelGIM</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = −280 nV; u<sub>c</sub>
    = 450 nV on 2011/07/27,</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty
    associated with the measured difference.\nThe results of the comparison show that
    there is a good agreement between the measurement results of the participants
    within their stated expanded uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p><p>Main

    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database
    kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for

    Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
