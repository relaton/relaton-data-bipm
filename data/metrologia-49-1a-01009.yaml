- content: |-
    <p>A comparison between the Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and that of the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial (INTI), Argentina, was made at the level of 1.018 V in November 2011. For this comparison, both options of the BIPM.EM-K10.a comparison protocol were applied (A and B). Option B required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the INTI using its Josephson standard and measuring device. Option A required the INTI to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the BIPM using its analogue detector and associated measurement loop. In each case the BIPM array was kept floating from ground.</p><p>The final result observed is in good agreement with the combined relative standard uncertainty of 1.98 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> for the nominal voltage of 1.018 V.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
