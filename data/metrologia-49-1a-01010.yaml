    <p>A comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the Federal Office of Metrology (METAS), Bern, Switzerland, was carried out in January 2012 at the level of 1 V and 10 V. For this exercise, options A and B of the BIPM.EM-K10 comparison protocol were applied. Option B required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by METAS using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. Option A required METAS to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the BIPM using its analogue detector and associated measurement loop. In both cases the BIPM array was kept floating from ground.</p>
    <p>The final results were in good agreement with the combined relative standard uncertainty of 1.00 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V and 4.3 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 1 V.</p>
