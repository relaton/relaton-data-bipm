    <p>A measurement comparison of complex reflection coefficient has been carried out among six national metrology laboratories in coaxial system at frequencies of 50 MHz, 2 GHz, 10 GHz and 18 GHz. Three 50 Ω coaxial mismatches (voltage standing wave ratios 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) in 7 mm connectors have been measured for their complex reflection coefficients in the magnitude and phase form. The six laboratories participated are NPL India, KRISS Korea, SCL Hong Kong, CMS ITRI Taiwan, NMC Singapore and CSIR-NML South Africa (now NMISA). The National Physical Laboratory (India) acted as the pilot laboratory for the comparison. Good agreement between the values provided by the participating laboratories has been observed: the degrees of equivalence for all the values reported, with respect to the reference value and between pairs of laboratories, are less than their associated uncertainties, at a level of confidence of 95%.</p>
