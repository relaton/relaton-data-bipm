    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the Measurement Standards Laboratory (MSL), New Zealand, in April 2011. For this exercise, option B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol was applied. This option required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the MSL using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. The BIPM array is kept floating from ground.</p>
    <p>The final results are in very good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 4.0 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p>
