abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of the 10 V Josephson array voltage standard of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made with that of the Measurement Standards Laboratory (MSL), New Zealand, in April 2011. For this exercise, option B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol was applied. This option required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the MSL using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. The BIPM array is kept floating from ground.</p><p>The final results are in very good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 4.0 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
