    <p>Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI) agreed in December 2008 to conduct a bilateral comparison on laser power responsivity at wavelengths 532 nm/530.9 nm, 1.064 µm and 10.6 µm. The aim of this comparison was to assess the equivalence of laser power responsivity measurements between the two laboratories. The comparison was conducted within the COOMET regional metrological organization (COOMET project 461/RU/090) and was registered in the BIPM Key Comparison DataBase as a supplementary comparison with the identifier COOMET.PR-S4.</p>
    <p>The comparison was carried out using two detector heads for measuring laser power. One detector head was supplied by PTB (OPHIR 30A) and the other detector head by VNIIOFI (COHERENT PM10).</p>
    <p>The results of this comparison essentially demonstrated agreement between the results obtained at the two participating laboratories. Furthermore, linkage between the laser radiometry laboratory of VNIIOFI and the  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/47/1A/02003">EUROMET.PR-S2</ext-link> supplementary comparison reference value was established.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by COOMET, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
