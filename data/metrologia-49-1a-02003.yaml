abstract:
- content: "<p>We report the results of the international comparison of LED measurements
    on the quantity of total luminous flux. The comparison is conducted by circulating
    four different types of artefact LEDs (red, green, blue and white) to 13 National
    Metrology Institutes (NMIs). The artefact LEDs are prepared by functional seasoning
    to enable a temperature correction based on the junction voltage measurement.
    The comparison reference values and the unilateral degrees of equivalence (DoEs)
    of each participant are calculated for each type of LEDs from the reported measurement
    results.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on   Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by APMP, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
