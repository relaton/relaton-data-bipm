    <p>We report the results of the international comparison of LED measurements on the quantity of total luminous flux. The comparison is conducted by circulating four different types of artefact LEDs (red, green, blue and white) to 13 National Metrology Institutes (NMIs). The artefact LEDs are prepared by functional seasoning to enable a temperature correction based on the junction voltage measurement. The comparison reference values and the unilateral degrees of equivalence (DoEs) of each participant are calculated for each type of LEDs from the reported measurement results.</p>
