abstract:
- content: "<p>The Comité Consulatif de Thermométrie (CCT) has organized several key
    comparisons to compare realizations of the ITS-90 in different National Metrology
    Institutes. To keep the organization, time scale and data processing of such a
    comparison manageable, the number of participants in a CCT key comparison (CCT
    KC) is limited to a few laboratories in each major economic region. Subsequent
    regional key comparisons are linked to the applicable CCT KC by two or more linking
    laboratories.</p><p>For the temperature range from 83.8058 K (triple point of
    Ar) to 933.473 K (freezing point of Al), a key comparison,   CCT-K3, was carried
    out from 1997 to 2001 among representative laboratories in North America, Europe
    and Asia. Following CCT-K3, the Asia-Pacific Metrology Program Key Comparison
    3 ( APMP.T-K3 ) was organized for National Metrology Institutes in the Asia/Pacific
    region. NMIA (Australia) and KRISS (South Korea) provided the link between CCT-K3
    and APMP.T-K3. APMP.T-K3, which took place from February 2000 to June 2003, covered
    the temperature  range from −38.8344 °C (triple point of Hg) to 419.527 °C (freezing
    point of Zn), using a standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) as the artefact.</p><p>In
    June 2007 the Vietnam Metrology Institute (VMI) requested a bilateral comparison
    to link their SPRT calibration capabilities to APMP.T-K3, and in October 2007
    the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA) agreed to provide the
    link to APMP.T-K3. Like APMP.T-K3, the comparison was restricted to the Hg to
    Zn temperature range to reduce the chance of drift in the SPRT artefact. The comparison
    was carried out in a participant–pilot–participant topology (with NMISA as the
    pilot and VMI as the participant). VMI's results in the comparison were linked
    to the Average Reference Values of CCT-K3 via NMISA's results in APMP.T-K3.</p><p>The
    resistance ratios measured by VMI and NMISA at Zn, Sn, Ga and Hg fixed points
    agree within their combined uncertainties, and VMI's results also agree with the
    CCT-K3 reference values at these fixed points.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the

    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA).</p>"
