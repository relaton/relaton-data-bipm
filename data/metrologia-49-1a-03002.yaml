    <p>An international bilateral comparison of platinum resistance thermometers was performed between the National Metrology Institutes of Chile (LCPNT-CESMEC) and the Ecuadorian Standardization Institute of Ecuador (INEN), both represented by their National Laboratories of Temperature. This comparison was carried out in the range from −39 °C up to 232 °C. The final results obtained by each laboratory showed to be equivalent (En &lt; 1) over the measured temperature range.</p>
