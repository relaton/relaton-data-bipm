    <p>A bilateral comparison of capsule-type standard platinum resistance thermometers (CSPRT) was carried out between NRC (Canada) and NMi-VSL (The Netherlands) in 2006 over the temperature range 13.8 K to 273.16 K. It made it possible to link the NMi-VSL realization of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 to the results of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry Key Comparison CCT-K2 over this temperature range. It revealed that calibrations at NMi-VSL were in agreement with the key comparison reference values of CCT-K2 within the expanded uncertainties for all temperatures of the comparison with the possible exception of the triple point of neon at 24.5561 K, where the difference from the key comparison reference value for one of the CSPRTs exceeds the expanded uncertainty. The linkage to the CCT-K2 data supports the evaluation of the NMi-VSL CMCs in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB).</p><p>Main text.
