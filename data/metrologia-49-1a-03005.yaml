    <p>A trilateral comparison of capsule-type standard platinum resistance thermometers (CSPRT) was carried out between NRC (Canada), INTiBS (Poland) and LNE (France) in 2006 over the temperature range 13.8 K to 273.16 K. The NRC/INTiBS comparison made it possible to link the INTiBS realization of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 to the results of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry Key Comparison CCT-K2 over this temperature range. It revealed that calibrations at INTiBS were in agreement with the key comparison reference values of CCT-K2 within the expanded uncertainties for all temperatures of the comparison based on the data obtained with one of CSPRTs, the other CSPRT of the comparison being considered as anomalous. The linkage to the CCT-K2 data supports the inclusion of the INTiBS CMCs in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB) and also supplies evidence to support the revision of the uncertainties of the LNE CMCs in the KCDB at the triple points of neon and hydrogen.</p><p>Main text.
