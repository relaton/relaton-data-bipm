    <p>This is the final report of EURAMET.T-K7.2 bilateral comparison of water triple point cells. This comparison was requested by the Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research, INTiBS, in its role as designated institute of Poland for participation in the CIPM MRA in the low temperature range of the thermometry field. The measurement protocol adopted was compatible with EURAMET.T-K7 with the only exception that INTiBS used capsule-type SPRTs (CSPRTs) instead of long-stem SPRTs (LSPRTs). The results showed a satisfactory degree of equivalence between VSL and INTiBS and allowed linkage to the parent key comparison EURAMET.T-K7. As a consequence, INTiBS is able to support CMCs for CSPRTs at the triple point of water and publish them in the KCDB.</p><p>Main text.
