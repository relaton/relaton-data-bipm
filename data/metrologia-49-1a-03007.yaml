    <p>A bilateral comparison between Centro Español de Metrología (CEM), Spain, and Laboratorio Costarricense de Metrología (LACOMET), Costa Rica, in the range 83.8058 K to 993.473 K has been developed during 2009 aimed at providing linkage of LACOMET results to those of the CCT key comparisons CCT-K3 and CCT-K4. The participation of CEM in the EURAMET regional key comparisons EUROMET.T-K3 and EUROMET.T-K4 is the basis of the link.</p><p>This report presents the results of this comparison, provides detailed information of the measurements performed by the participating laboratories, and links the comparison results to the CCT and EURAMET related comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
