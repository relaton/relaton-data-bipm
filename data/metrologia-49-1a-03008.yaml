    <p>This is the final report of EURAMET.T-K7.3 bilateral comparison of water triple point cells. This comparison was requested by the Central Office of Measures, GUM, in its role of National Metrology Institute of Poland designated for participation in the CIPM MRA in the medium and high temperature range (T ⩾ 83.8058 K) of the thermometry field. The measurement protocol adopted was compatible with EURAMET.T-K7, thus allowing linking of the results to the parent key comparisons EURAMET.T-K7 and CCT-K7. As a consequence, GUM is able to support CMCs at the triple point of water and publish them in the KCDB.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
