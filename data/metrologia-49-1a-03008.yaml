    <p>This is the final report of EURAMET.T-K7.3 bilateral comparison of water triple point cells. This comparison was requested by the Central Office of Measures, GUM, in its role of National Metrology Institute of Poland designated for participation in the CIPM MRA in the medium and high temperature range (<italic>T</italic> ⩾ 83.8058 K) of the thermometry field. The measurement protocol adopted was compatible with EURAMET.T-K7, thus allowing linking of the results to the parent key comparisons EURAMET.T-K7 and  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/43/1A/03001">CCT-K7</ext-link>. As a consequence, GUM is able to support CMCs at the triple point of water and publish them in the KCDB.</p>
