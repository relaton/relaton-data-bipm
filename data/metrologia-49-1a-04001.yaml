    <p>This report summarizes the result of a comparison of length standards conducted between seven members of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). Two sets of gauge blocks made of steel and tungsten carbide, each with nominal values 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 50 mm and 100 mm were used as travelling standards. The comparison was coordinated by the Research Centre for Calibration, Instrumentation and Metrologyâ€“Indonesian Institute of Sciences (KIM-LIPI) and assisted by the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), sponsored by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) through APMP's Developing Economies' Committee (DEC). The comparison was carried out from October 2006 to January 2009. Preparatory and concluding workshops were organized to assist the participants in preparing for the comparison and analyzing it.</p>
