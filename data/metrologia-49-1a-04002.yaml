    <p>The laser from the Vietnam metrological institute (VMI) was brought to the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) in November 2007 in the framework of the APMP.L-K11.1 bilateral key comparison. The absolute frequency of the f component of the R(127) 11-5 transition was measured for this laser and KRISS's laser following the protocol for key comparison BIPM.L-K11. The results of these measurements are compiled in the present report.</p><p>Main text.
