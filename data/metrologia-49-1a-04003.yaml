    <p>The COOMET Project No 390/BY/07, 'Supplementary comparison of standards of the unit for length (metre) in the measurement range from 0.1 mm to 100 mm', KCDB reference COOMET.L-S7, was organized by the Technical Committee TC 1.5 'Length and Angle' of COOMET.</p><p>This comparison started in May 2007 and finished in October 2010. It was piloted by the Belarusian State Institute of Metrology BelGIM, Minsk, the Republic of Belarus, with other participants as follows: GUM (Warsaw, Poland), DP 'Ukrmetrteststandart' (Kiev, Ukraine), NSC 'Institute of Metrology' (Kharkov, Ukraine), SMU (Bratislava, Slovakia) and RSE 'KazInMetr' (Astana, Kazakhstan).</p><p>The transfer standards provided by BelGIM were carried to the place of the comparison by NMI attendant specialists as personal baggage, where they were measured.</p><p>The pilot laboratory processed the data obtained for the deviations of measured median lengths from the nominal lengths of the transfer standards in order to estimate the measurement result differences between the measuring instruments.</p><p>The conclusion is that the equivalence of the reference installations for parameter measurements of the participating National Metrology Institutes is sufficient, and constitutes an appropriate basis for mutual recognition of measurement results.</p><p>Main text.
