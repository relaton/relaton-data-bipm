    <p>During the EURAMET TC-L meeting in Lisbon in October 2009 a key comparison of gauge blocks by interferometry between five laboratories was initiated by the Croatian National Laboratory for Length, in order to test the performance of new equipment and to support CMC submission. The final report describes the measurement of eight short gauge blocks, with central length as the measurand. Since preliminary results were not consistent, statistical analysis of the entire dataset indicated that one laboratory should be excluded from calculation of the KCRV. Furthermore, another laboratory was asked to increase their measurement uncertainty due to rounding of the measurand value. Final results show good overall agreement, with the entire set being statistically consistent according to Birge ratio criteria.</p>
