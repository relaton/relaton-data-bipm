    <p>The results of the APMP key comparison on step gauge (APMP.L-K5.2006) are reported. The transfer standard was provided by NMIJ, Japan. This standard has 620 mm nominal length and 32 measurement faces. Thirteen National Metrology Institutes (10 from APMP, 3 from other Regional Metrology Organizations) participated in this comparison. The comparison started in December 2005 and finished in December 2007. Participants have used different measurement techniques, which are normally used for calibration services. The measurement results are in good agreement except for three laboratories. For determining the key comparison reference values, all faces data from three laboratories and one (face 30) datum from one laboratory were excluded.</p><p>Main text.
