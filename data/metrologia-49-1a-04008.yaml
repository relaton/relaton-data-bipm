    <p>The results of the inter-RMO key comparison EUROMET.L-K5.2004 on the calibration of a step gauge are reported. Eighteen National Metrology Institutes and one Designated Institute from four different metrological regions all over the world participated in this comparison which lasted three years, from December 2004 to December 2007.</p><p>A lack of stability was observed through the shifting of some of the inserted gauges. In order to save the comparison and get valuable and useful conclusions, it was agreed to exclude four gauges from calculation and assume that only seven gauges were reasonably stable so as to get the corresponding reference values. It was also agreed to divide the participants into two groups, analyze separately their results and, taking the pilot as the linking laboratory, refer the results to common reference values.</p><p>The inverse-variance weighted mean was taken as reference value. Due to the significant instability of the step it was also considered an artefact uncertainty. The reported uncertainties ranged from 0.045 µm to 1.2 µm (k = 1). The uncertainty of the artefact ranged from 0.018 µm (for the 20 mm face) to 0.176 µm (for the 400 mm face).</p><p>The compatibility of all participants for measuring step gauges was demonstrated with the only exception of a participant showing very high systematic (both positive and negative) errors. Five participants communicated higher uncertainties than the corresponding approved CMCs. A set of Recommendations and Actions were agreed therefore.</p><p>Main text.
