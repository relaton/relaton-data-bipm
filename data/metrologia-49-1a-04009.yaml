    <p>Lasers from four national metrological institutes (NMIs) were compared as part of the CCL-K11 ongoing key comparison, initiated by the 13th meeting of the Comité Consultative des Longueurs (CCL) in 2007. The absolute frequency of the f component of the R(127) 11-5 transition of molecular iodine was measured for these lasers following the technical protocol for CCL-K11. The results of these measurements are compiled in the present report. The comparison reports, as communicated by each participant, are included as appendices.</p>
    <p>This document constitutes the third final report for the ongoing key comparison CCL-K11.</p>
