abstract:
- content: "<p>Lasers from four national metrological institutes (NMIs) were compared
    as part of the CCL-K11 ongoing key comparison, initiated by the 13th meeting of
    the Comité Consultative des Longueurs (CCL) in 2007. The absolute frequency of
    the f component of the R(127) 11-5 transition of molecular iodine was measured
    for these lasers following the technical protocol for CCL-K11. The results of
    these measurements are compiled in the present report. The comparison reports,
    as communicated by each participant, are included as appendices.</p><p>This document
    constitutes the third final report for the ongoing key comparison CCL-K11.</p><p>
