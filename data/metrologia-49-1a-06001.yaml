    <p>In 2007, the Laboratoire national de métrologie et d'essais–Laboratoire national Henri Becquerel (LNE–LNHB), France submitted a sample of known activity of  <sup>222</sup>Rn to the International Reference System (SIR) for comparison. The value of the activity submitted was about 90 kBq. This key comparison result joins that of Switzerland and Germany in the key comparison database that now contains three results, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Rn-222. Consequently, the KCRV has been updated and the degrees of equivalence with the KCRV have been evaluated.</p>
