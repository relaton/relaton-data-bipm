    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the GUM and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement to better than the expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) for the comparison of 6.0 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
