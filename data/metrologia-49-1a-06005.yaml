abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>In 2008 and 2010, the Institutul de Fizica si Inginerie Nucleara–"Horia Hulubei" (IFIN–HH) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) submitted samples of known activity of<sup>57</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR). The values of the activity submitted were about 3.3 MBq and 125 MBq respectively. The new key comparison results have replaced the previous result for the USA and incorporate a first result for Romania. These new results, together with a recent re-evaluation of the half-life of<sup>57</sup>Co have enabled a re-evaluation of the key comparison reference value. The degrees of equivalence in the key comparison database now contain twelve updated results for the comparison, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-57.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section II, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
