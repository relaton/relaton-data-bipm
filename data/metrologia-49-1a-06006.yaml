abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NIST and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in general agreement at the level of the combined standard uncertainty for the comparison of 4.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>, although the results for the different radiation qualities show variations that are larger than would be expected. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
