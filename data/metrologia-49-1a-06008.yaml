    <p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), United Kingdom and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has been made in  <sup>60</sup>Co gamma radiation under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the NPL and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9980 (0.0064). The degrees of equivalence for the NPL and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table for the eleven national metrology institutes (NMIs) that have taken part in the ongoing comparison for absorbed dose to water. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
