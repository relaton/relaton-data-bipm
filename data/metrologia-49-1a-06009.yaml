- content: |-
    <p>A comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), Australia, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in June 2010 under the auspices of the key comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients measured for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the ARPANSA and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9973 (53). This result replaces the 1997 ARPANSA value of 1.0024 (30) in this key comparison. The degrees of equivalence for the ARPANSA and the other participants in this comparison have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table for the national metrology institutes (NMIs) that have results published in this ongoing comparison for absorbed dose to water. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
