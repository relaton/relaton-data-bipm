- content: |-
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the MKEH, Hungary and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the expanded uncertainty for the comparison of 4.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. No significant trend with radiation quality is observed. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
