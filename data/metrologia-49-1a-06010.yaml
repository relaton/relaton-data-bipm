abstract:
- content: "<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the
    MKEH, Hungary and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the
    standards to be in agreement within the expanded uncertainty for the comparison
    of 4.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. No significant trend with radiation quality is
    observed. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence,
    suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p> Main text. \nTo
    reach the main text of this paper, click on   Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI Section
    I, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM
    MRA).</p>"
