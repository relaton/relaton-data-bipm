    <p>In 2010, seven laboratories took part in the CCRI(II) key comparison of activity concentration measurements of  <sup>241</sup>Pu, CCRI(II)-K2.Pu-241, using seven different methods. The spread of all results except one is 4 × 10<sup>−2</sup> in relative terms. The results based on the CIEMAT/NIST efficiency tracing method are shown to be dependent on the beta spectrum shape selected and further work is proposed.</p>
    <p>The key comparison reference value has been determined as the arithmetic mean of six independent results based on four different methods. The results of the comparison have been analyzed with respect to the key comparison reference value. The degrees of equivalence relative to the key comparison reference value have been approved by the CCRI(II) and are published in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
