    <p>In September 2011, the third comparison of activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ). An ampoule containing about 38 kBq of<sup>99m</sup>Tc traceable to the NMIJ primary standard was measured in the SIRTI for more than three half-lives. No<sup>99</sup>Mo impurity had been identified in the solution. The comparison, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m, is linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparison, and the degrees of equivalence with the key comparison reference value and between the present NMIJ result, the other K4 participants and the six participants in the K1 comparison have been evaluated. World-wide consistency of activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc is demonstrated.</p><p>Main text.
