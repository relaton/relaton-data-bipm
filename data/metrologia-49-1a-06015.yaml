    <p>Comparison measurements among primary standard facilities are required to achieve quality assurance in the realization and transfer of the quantity of personal dose equivalent,  <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(10), for photon radiation by national standards laboratories. Although some bilateral comparisons for this quantity had already taken place, in May 2003 the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation [CCRI(I)] decided that a EUROMET supplementary comparison would be appropriate and that primary standards laboratories from other Regional Metrology Organizations could participate. The first comparison of the radiation protection quantity  <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(10) with low energy x-rays started in January 2004 and was completed in December 2007. The comparison was piloted by the PTB as EUROMET project No. 738 known also as EUROMET.RI(I)-S5.</p>
    <p>The operation and results of the comparison are reported here. The transfer instrument consisted of a secondary standard ionization chamber and a complete electronic measuring device. The response of this transfer instrument in various photon reference fields (N-15 and 0°, N-20 and 45°, N-30 and 75°, N-60 and 0°, N-120 and 0°, radiation quality according to ISO 4037-1:1996 [1]) was compared.</p>
    <p>Measurements were made by participants in 17 countries: Austria, France, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and by one international organization. The results obtained by most of the participants are consistent with the stated uncertainties.</p>
