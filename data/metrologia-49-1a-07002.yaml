abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>This report describes CIPM key comparison CCM.F-K2, a comparison between the deadweight force standard machines of fourteen National Measurement Institutes, at generated forces of 50 kN and 100 kN, in the period from 2004 to 2007. Two different measurement schemes were employed, one for machines capable of generating both 50 kN and 100 kN and the other using the single force of 50 kN, for machines of a lower maximum capacity than 100 kN. Multiple transducers were used and the force–time profile was strictly controlled, to minimize effects of creep. Analysis of the results took careful account of the drift of the transducers' sensitivities throughout the comparison period, as this was one of the major uncertainty contributions. The final results suggest that the nominal 50 kN forces generated at four of the fourteen laboratories (and the 100 kN forces at two of them) may be statistically significantly different from the same nominal forces generated at the other laboratories.</p><p>Main text.
