    <p>This bilateral comparison was carried out in the field of liquid hydrocarbon flow following the  <italic>Guidelines for CIPM Key Comparisons</italic>. This APMP.M.FF-K2 comparison involved two laboratories: Center for Measurement Standards (CMS, Chinese Taipei) and Vietnam Measurement Institute (VMI), which are both national standard calibration laboratories.</p>
    <p>The bilateral comparison was conducted using light liquid hydrocarbon across a flow range of 5 L s<sup>−1</sup> to 30 L s<sup>−1</sup>. A Kral positive displacement meter served as the transfer standard. The Strouhal number and Reynolds number served as the key parameters for expressing the laboratories' measurements of volume and flowrate.</p>
    <p>The  <italic>En</italic> value of the VMI test results with reference to CMS was 0.28.</p>
