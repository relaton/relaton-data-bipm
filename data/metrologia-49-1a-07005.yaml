    <p>This report describes a European regional key comparison of 1 kg standard and submultiples of the kilogram in stainless steel carried out under the auspices of EURAMET, designated Project 1120 and conducted in 2009 and 2010. This comparison corresponds also to two KCDB key comparisons, registered as EURAMET.M.M-K4.2 for 1 kg and EURAMET.M.M-K2.2 for the nominal weights of 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg.</p>
    <p>BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory and also provided the transfer standards.</p>
    <p>Links of the results are provided to the CCM key comparisons  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/41/1A/07002">CCM.M-K1</ext-link> and CCM.M.M-K2.</p>
    <p>The results help to check the measurement possibilities in the field of mass of the participating national laboratories, to facilitate the demonstration of metrological equivalence between the laboratories in Europe, and to check or support the validity of quoted calibration measurement capabilities (CMCs).</p>
