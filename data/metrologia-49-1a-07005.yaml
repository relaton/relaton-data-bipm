    <p>This report describes a European regional key comparison of 1 kg standard and submultiples of the kilogram in stainless steel carried out under the auspices of EURAMET, designated Project 1120 and conducted in 2009 and 2010. This comparison corresponds also to two KCDB key comparisons, registered as EURAMET.M.M-K4.2 for 1 kg and EURAMET.M.M-K2.2 for the nominal weights of 500 g, 20 g, 2 g and 100 mg.</p><p>BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory and also provided the transfer standards.</p><p>Links of the results are provided to the CCM key comparisons CCM.M-K1 and CCM.M.M-K2.</p><p>The results help to check the measurement possibilities in the field of mass of the participating national laboratories, to facilitate the demonstration of metrological equivalence between the laboratories in Europe, and to check or support the validity of quoted calibration measurement capabilities (CMCs).</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
