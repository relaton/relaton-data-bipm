    <p>This report describes a CCM key comparison of hydraulic pressure standards of seven National Metrology Institutes, listed in the chronological order of their measurements, that was carried out in the period from December 2008 to March 2010 in order to determine their degrees of equivalence in the range 50 MPa to 500 MPa of gauge pressure. The pilot laboratory was PTB. The primary pressure standards were pressure balances of different design equipped with piston–cylinder assemblies operated in free-deformation, controlled-clearance or re-entrant operation mode. The transfer standard was a piston–cylinder assembly in a pressure balance. The pressure-dependent effective areas of the transfer standard at specified pressures were reported by the participants and led to the reference values calculated as medians. Results of all participants excepting NIM agree with the reference values and with each other within the expanded uncertainties calculated with a coverage factor 2, most of them even within their standard uncertainties. In addition, the results were analysed in terms of the zero pressure effective area and the pressure distortion coefficient. Also for them agreement within expanded uncertainties (k = 2) is observed. The results of the comparison demonstrate equivalence of the laboratory standards and of the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities currently presented in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.
