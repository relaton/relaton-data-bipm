    <p>Interlaboratory comparisons are important for the laboratories to assess their own measurement capability. It is equally important for the accreditation bodies and assessors during the audit process of a laboratory to judge whether the laboratory is doing well. As per accreditation rules, it is mandatory for the testing and calibration laboratories to participate in such comparisons from time to time.</p>
    <p>In this report, results of the bilateral interlaboratory comparison in pressure area in hydraulic media up to 50 MPa gauge between UME (Turkey) and BOM (The FYR of Macedonia) are presented. The artefact used for the comparison was a digital pressure calibrator and its drift was taken into account in the calculation.</p>
    <p>Results show that all  <italic>En</italic> values lie in acceptable limits.</p>
