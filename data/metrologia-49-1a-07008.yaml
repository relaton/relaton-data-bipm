    <p>This report gives the results of the APMP.M.F-K4.b key comparison in 2 MN force range. This regional key comparison was conducted under the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) to establish a link to the global  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/49/1A/07003">CCM.F-K4.b</ext-link> key comparison.</p>
    <p>Seven institutes participated in this key comparison. The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST) served as the pilot institute. The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) together with NMIJ/AIST provided links to the CCM.F-K4.b key comparison. A pair of force transducers having 2 MN nominal capacities was circulated among the participants in a star formation.</p>
    <p>This regional key comparison revealed that all measurement results of the seven participants are coherent with the CCM.F-K4.b key comparison reference value within their uncertainties and that these participants are equivalent to each other.</p>
