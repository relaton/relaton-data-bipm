    <p>This report gives the results of the APMP.M.F-K4.b key comparison in 2 MN force range. This regional key comparison was conducted under the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) to establish a link to the global CCM.F-K4.b key comparison.</p><p>Seven institutes participated in this key comparison. The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST) served as the pilot institute. The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) together with NMIJ/AIST provided links to the CCM.F-K4.b key comparison. A pair of force transducers having 2 MN nominal capacities was circulated among the participants in a star formation.</p><p>This regional key comparison revealed that all measurement results of the seven participants are coherent with the CCM.F-K4.b key comparison reference value within their uncertainties and that these participants are equivalent to each other.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
