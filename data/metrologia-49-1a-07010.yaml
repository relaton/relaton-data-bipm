abstract:
- content: "<p>This report summarizes the results of the supplementary comparison
    SIM.M.M-S10 of a 5 kg stainless steel mass standard between INDECOPI (Peru) and
    CEM (Spain).The objective of the comparison was to demonstrate the metrological
    equivalence between the two laboratories. The results of the comparison will be
    used to support the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) declared by
    the institutes at 5 kg.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper,

    B of the BIPM key comparison database   kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the SIM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
