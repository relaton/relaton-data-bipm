    <p>The International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters 2009 (ICAG2009) was carried out in September 2009 at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The ICAG2009 and its data processing were performed in accordance with the agreed Technical Protocol which was approved by the Steering Committee. The pilot laboratory (BIPM) evaluated the final results of the key comparison from the measurements made at the BIPM in the framework of ICAG2009. A pilot study run in parallel allowed evaluation of the offsets for absolute gravimeters from institutes not fulfilling the requirements for participating in the key comparison. The gravity values at the five stations, and the offsets for each absolute gravimeter, were obtained by a weighted least squares fit. The results indicate that all participating gravimeters are consistent within their expanded uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
