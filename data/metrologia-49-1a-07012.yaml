    <p>A regional supplementary comparison for the volume of liquid at 50 mL was conducted during October 2009 to June 2010 between the SIM members CENAM, INTI, INMETRO, INDECOPI and INTN. The transfer standard consisted of two 50 mL glass pycnometers, of the Gay Lussac type. CENAM acted as the pilot, collected the measurement results, analyzed the data and produced the comparison report.</p>
    <p>The median of all participants' results was used to calculate the regional comparison reference value because the result for one of the two pycnometers in one laboratory failed the chi-squared test at the 0.05 probability level. The measurements reported by the participants show an excellent overlap in four out of the five NMIs (−34×10<sup>−6</sup> &lt;   <italic>D<sub>i</sub></italic> &lt; 29×10<sup>−6</sup>). The degree of equivalence obtained herein will be taken into account for the preparation of calibration and measurement capabilities claims from the participants.</p>
