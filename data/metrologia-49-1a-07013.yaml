    <p>This report summarizes the results of a bilateral comparison of mass standards with nominal values of 10 kg, 500 g and 20 g between EIM (Greece) and BoM (FYR Macedonia). The objectives of the bilateral comparison were to facilitate the demonstration of metrological equivalence between the two participating national laboratories and to verify the measurement capabilities of BoM in support of its CMC claims in the field of mass standard calibration.</p><p>Results are consistent with the key comparison reference values of CCM.M-K2 to which this comparison was linked via the regional key comparison EURAMET.M.M-K2.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
