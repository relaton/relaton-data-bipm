    <p>This report summarizes the results of a bilateral comparison of mass standards with nominal values of 10 kg, 500 g and 20 g between EIM (Greece) and BoM (FYR Macedonia). The objectives of the bilateral comparison were to facilitate the demonstration of metrological equivalence between the two participating national laboratories and to verify the measurement capabilities of BoM in support of its CMC claims in the field of mass standard calibration.</p>
    <p>Results are consistent with the key comparison reference values of  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/40/1A/07004/">CCM.M-K2</ext-link> to which this comparison was linked via the regional key comparison EURAMET.M.M-K2.</p>
