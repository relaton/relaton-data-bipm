    <p>During November 2011 a EURAMET key comparison of absolute gravimeters was organized in the Underground Laboratory for Geodynamics in Walferdange, Luxemburg. The comparison assembled 22 participants coming from 16 countries and four different continents. The comparison was divided into two parts: a key comparison that included six National Metrology Institutes or Designated Institutes, and a pilot study including all participants. The global result given by the pilot study confirms that all instruments are absolutely coherent with each other. The results obtained in the key comparison confirm a good agreement between the NMI instruments. Finally, a link to   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/49/1A/07011/">ICAG-2009</ext-link> shows also that the NMI gravimeters are stable in time.</p>
