    <p>This key comparison was performed to demonstrate the capability of NMIs to analyse the purity of methane for use as a source gas in the preparation of standard gas mixtures. This capability is an essential requirement for the preparation of accurate standards of natural gas and some other fuels.</p><p>Since it is difficult to carry out a comparison with individual samples of pure gas, the sample for this comparison was a synthetic mixture of high purity methane with selected added impurities of nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and ethane. These mixtures were prepared by a gas company as a batch of 10 cylinders and their homogeneity and stability were evaluated by NMIJ.</p><p>The KCRVs for the four different analytes in this key comparison are based on a consensus of values reported by participants. The uncertainties in the degrees of equivalence were calculated by combining the reported uncertainties with the homogeneity of the samples and the uncertainty of the KCRV. The results submitted are generally consistent with the KCRV within the estimated uncertainties.</p><p>Finally, this comparison demonstrates that the analysis of nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide and ethane in methane at amount fractions of 1 µmol/mol to 5 µmol/mol is generally possible with an uncertainty of 5% to 10%.</p><p>Main text.
