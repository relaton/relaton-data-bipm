    <p>In order to address laboratory capability for the determination of trace elements in drinking water and to support corresponding CMC submissions for several SIM members, the exercise SIM.QM-S2 was planned in 2008 and authorized as a supplementary comparison at the April 2010 meeting of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substanceâ€“Metrology in Chemistry (CCQM).</p>
    <p>Laboratories participating in SIM.QM-S2 generally agree within stated uncertainties with the reference value. This analysis is relatively easy as the matrix is simple and the mass fractions are above ICP-MS detection limits for cadmium, lead and nickel, and with that for calcium also well above the detection limit for ICP-OES and FAAS. The calcium results for all but two laboratories are traceable to the same NIST SRM used to spike the solution, resulting in a comparison of preparation of calibration solutions rather than a matrix sample.</p>
    <p>Core capability forms submitted by the SIM.QM-S2 participants generally agreed that this exercise demonstrated a low level of difficulty. It would be expected that potential CMC claims as a result of this study could not be extended beyond similar water samples with a simple matrix.</p>
