abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The aim of this comparison was to demonstrate the capability of national metrology institutes to measure elemental mass fractions at a level of w(E) ≈ 1 g/kg as found in almost all mono-elemental calibration solutions. These calibration solutions represent an important link in traceability systems in inorganic analysis. Virtually all traceable routine measurements are linked to the SI through these calibration solutions. Every participant was provided with three solutions of each of the three selected elements chromium, cobalt and lead. This comparison was a joint activity of the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) and the Electrochemical Analysis Working Group (EAWG) of the CCQM and was piloted by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany) with the help of the Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung (BAM, Berlin, Germany), the Centro Nacional de Metrología (CENAM, Querétaro, Mexico) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, USA).</p><p>A small majority of participants applied inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) in combination with a variety of calibration strategies (one-point-calibration, bracketing, calibration curve, each with and without an internal standard). But also IDMS techniques were carried out on quadrupole, high resolution and multicollector ICP-MS machines as well as a TIMS machine. Several participants applied titrimetry. FAAS as well as ICP-MS combined with non-IDMS calibration strategies were used by at least one participant. The key comparison reference values (KCRV) were agreed upon during the IAWG/EAWG meeting in November 2011 held in Sydney as the added element content calculated from the gravimetric sample preparation. Accordingly the degrees of equivalence were calculated. Despite the large variety of methods applied no superior method could be identified. The relative deviation of the median of the participants' results from the gravimetric reference value was equal or smaller than 0.1% (with an average of 0.05%) in the case of all three elements.</p><p>Main text.
