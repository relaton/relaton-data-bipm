    <p>This is the final report for supplementary comparison AFRIMETS.AUV.V-S2 in the area of 'vibration' (quantity of acceleration). The aim of this comparison was to measure the sensitivity of an accelerometer with primary means in the frequency range from 0.4 Hz to 50 Hz. Two national metrology institutes took part in the supplementary comparison and the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA) piloted the comparison. A transfer standard, with conditioning amplifier, was circulated between the participants. Calibration results in the form of calibration certificates were submitted as part of the comparison. The supplementary comparison reference values (SCRVs) have been calculated using the weighted mean value of the results. At all frequencies, the reported sensitivities deviated by less than 0.2% between the laboratories. At the reference frequency of 16 Hz, the participating laboratories calibrated the transfer standard with a relative expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) equal to 0.3%, i.e. smaller than the limit specified by the ISO 16063-11:1999 standard.</p>
