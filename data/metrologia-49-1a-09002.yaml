    <p>A regional key comparison APMP.AUV.A-K3 has been carried out for the pressure sensitivity of laboratory standard microphones. Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) was the pilot laboratory for this project. Two LS2P microphones were circulated through ten national metrology institutes and calibrated in the frequency range from 31.5 Hz to 25 kHz (31.5 kHz was optional). Deviations from the mean value for all participants are within their declared expanded uncertainties for all frequencies except the optional 31.5 kHz. Results were linked to the CIPM key comparison CCAUV.A-K3.</p><p>Main text.
