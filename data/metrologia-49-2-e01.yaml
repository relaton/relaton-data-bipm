  content: "<p>The NEWRAD Conferences bring together people from the National Metrology
    Institutes and the principal user communities of advanced radiometry, including
    Earth observation and climate communities. The eleventh NEWRAD Conference was
    held in Hawaii, USA, between 18 and 23 September 2011. The Conference was organized
    by the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Maui, at the Grand Wailea resort. The
    organization was a joint Pacific effort, where handling of the submitted abstracts
    and website administration were taken care of by KRISS (Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology),
    respectively. As satellite activities, the working groups of CCPR (Consultative
    Committee for Photometry and Radiometry) and the MOBY project arranged meetings
    at the Grand Wailea before and after the Conference.</p>\n<p>The Conference was
    attended by more than a hundred registered participants from five continents,
    which matches the number of foreign participants of NEWRAD 2008 at KRISS. A total
    of 153 papers were presented at NEWRAD 2011, of which 10 were invited talks and
    100 posters. The poster sessions during the extended lunch breaks created a stimulating
    atmosphere for lively discussions and exchange of ideas. A technical visit was
    arranged to the astronomical observatory at the summit of Haleakala volcano, where
    some of the world's most advanced telescope systems are operated. The relaxed
    Hawaiian life, nearby ocean and excellent weather conditions gave an unprecedented
    flavour to this NEWRAD Conference.</p>\n<p>The abstract classification system
    was renewed for NEWRAD 2011, consisting of the following categories:</p>\n<p>EAO:
    Earth observation \nSSR: Solar/stellar radiometry \nSBR: Source-based radiometry
    \nOPM: Optical properties of materials/components \nDBR: Detector-based radiometry
    \nSFR: Single/few-photon radiometry.</p>\n<p>The new system worked well for refereeing
    and program purposes.  Conference proceedings containing two-page extended abstracts
    were distributed to the participants on a USB memory stick. These proceedings
    are also available on the internet at  <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://newrad2011.org/program.php\">newrad2011.org/program.php</ext-link>
    and/or  <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://newrad2011.aalto.fi\">newrad2011.aalto.fi</ext-link>.
    The authors of selected contributions were invited to submit a full paper to this
    special issue. The submitted papers were handled by the normal reviewing procedures
    of  <italic>Metrologia</italic>.</p>\n<p>Two important new topics in radiometry
    were emphasized in the planning of the scientific program: special sessions of
    half a day of contributed talks on Earth observation (EAO) and on single/few-photon
    radiometry (SFR) were included in NEWRAD 2011. The remaining abstract categories
    listed above are more traditional, but the related contributions contain equally
    important results, such as analysis of array spectroradiometer data [1], a pulsed
    laser method for responsivity calibrations [2] and a predictable quantum efficient
    detector [3], to mention just a few of those.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the Scientific
    Committee and all the participants, I thank Mark Yarbrough and his colleagues
    at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories for arranging an excellent conference
    on Maui, Seongchong Park (KRISS) for invaluable help in abstract management, and
    Benjamin Tsai (NIST) for professional website maintenance. I am deeply grateful
    to the reviewers and editorial staff of  <italic>Metrologia</italic> for careful
    processing of the manuscripts of this special issue. It is evident that the special
    issue will serve as an important reference for radiometry.</p>\n<p>The next NEWRAD
    Conference will be organized by Aalto University and MIKES (Centre for Metrology
    and Accreditation) in Finland during the week 23–27 June 2014. The Chairman of
    the Local Organizing Committee is Petri Kärhä, who can be contacted at  <ext-link
