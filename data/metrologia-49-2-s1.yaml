abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a novel method to measure the absolute spectral emissivity
    of a blackbody cavity in situ using the heated halo, a broadband thermal source.
    Laboratory demonstrations have yielded spectral emissivity measurements of a 0.999
    emissivity blackbody that are in agreement with results based on Monte Carlo ray
    trace modelling. The combined uncertainty of the measurement is less than 4 ×
    10<sup>−4</sup> (k = 3) in the 580 cm<sup>−1</sup> to 2800 cm<sup>−1</sup> spectral
    range. This is equivalent to a detection limit of 11 mK in the error in radiance
    temperature for a calibration blackbody (at 330 K, 1500 cm<sup>−1</sup>) due to
    blackbody cavity emissivity drift. These results provide the experimental foundation
    for this technology to be implemented on satellite instruments and thus eliminate
    a key, time-dependent, systematic error from future measurements on-orbit.</p>"
