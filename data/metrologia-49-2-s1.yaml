  content: "<p>We present a novel method to measure the absolute spectral emissivity
    of a blackbody cavity <italic>in situ</italic> using the heated halo, a broadband
    thermal source. Laboratory demonstrations have yielded spectral emissivity measurements
    of a 0.999 emissivity blackbody that are in agreement with results based on Monte
    Carlo ray trace modelling. The combined uncertainty of the measurement is less
    than 4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> (<italic>k</italic> = 3) in the 580 cm<sup>−1</sup> to
    2800 cm<sup>−1</sup> spectral range. This is equivalent to a detection limit of
    11 mK in the error in radiance temperature for a calibration blackbody (at 330 K,
    1500 cm<sup>−1</sup>) due to blackbody cavity emissivity drift. These results
    provide the experimental foundation for this technology to be implemented on satellite
    instruments and thus eliminate a key, time-dependent, systematic error from future
    measurements on-orbit.</p>"
