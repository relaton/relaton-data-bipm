  content: "<p>A new reference radiometer for downwelling atmospheric longwave irradiance
    has been designed and built. The new infrared integrating sphere (IRIS) radiometer
    is designed to acquire measurements with a time constant of less than 1 s. Based
    on a thorough characterization, the IRIS radiometer is able to measure longwave
    irradiance with an expanded uncertainty of ±1.8 W m<sup>−2</sup> and ±2.4 W m<sup>−2</sup>
    in the summer and winter seasons, respectively, which is equivalent to a temperature
    range between +15 °C and −15 °C for typical conditions at Davos, Switzerland.
    The long-term stability of the IRIS radiometer was determined over a one year
    period, yielding a calibration reproducibility in the laboratory of 0.5%. Outdoor
    measurements with four IRIS radiometers were performed during 13 clear nights
    in April 2011. The four radiometers measured atmospheric longwave irradiance with
    differences ranging from −1.1 W m<sup>−2</sup> to +0.7 W m<sup>−2</sup>, which
    were well within their estimated uncertainties.</p>"
