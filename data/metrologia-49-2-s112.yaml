  content: "<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working
    to extend the upper wavelength limit of the spectral power-responsivity calibration
    service from 1800 nm to 2500 nm. This extension is based on extended-InGaAs (EIGA)
    transfer- and working-standard radiometers and low-NEP pyroelectric transfer-standard
    detectors. The scale is traceable to the electrical-substitution cryogenic radiometer
    through the transfer-standard EIGA radiometers. The total uncertainty of the extended-responsivity
    reference scale (realized on four EIGA working-standard radiometers) is 1% (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2). The transfer of the reference scale from one of the four working standards
    to a test EIGA radiometer in direct-current (dc) measurement mode is described.
    The uncertainty of the transferred scale is 1.6% (<italic>k</italic> = 2) between
    1200 nm and 2300 nm. The transfer was performed on the NIST Spectral Comparator
    Facility (SCF) without any modifications to the SCF. The EIGA radiometers have
    been characterized for spatial-response uniformity, temperature-dependent spectral
    responsivity, linearity, noise, long-term and short-term temporal stability. The
    preliminary results show that EIGA radiometers can be used over the spectral range
    between 900 nm and 2500 nm in dc mode and could eventually replace the regular
    InGaAs detectors in the SCF measurements. The total uncertainty budget for these
    measurements is discussed.</p>"
