  content: "<p>Among possible losses in the efficiency of semiconductor photodiodes
    and solar cells, optical losses are dominant in many cases and, therefore, are
    important. The optical losses, mainly consisting of reflection from the surface
    and absorption in a dead layer, are evaluated based on a theoretical model whose
    validity was confirmed by experiments. The effect of the surface layer on the
    optical properties of the whole system is analysed, using a complex plane representation
    of reflectance and transmittance, to be quite important, and is sensitive to its
    layer thickness and the angle of incidence. The results are presented as a function
    of wavelength, surface film thickness and angle of incidence. The results show
    that the optical properties of the layered system are completely different from
    those of a single boundary system and change steeply in the UV range due to the
    change in optical indices of both the surface layer and the substrate.</p>"
