  content: "<p>Continuous-wave (CW) tunable lasers have been used for detector calibrations,
    especially for spectral irradiance and radiance responsivity, for many years at
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other national metrology
    institutes. These CW tunable lasers, however, are expensive and difficult to automate.
    To address these issues, we developed a new method for spectral irradiance and
    radiance responsivity calibrations using relatively low cost, fully automated
    kilohertz pulsed tunable optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The new method
    is based on measurements of the total energy of a pulsed OPO train using two synchronized
    current integrators (also called charge amplifiers) to measure the total integrated
    electric charges from a test detector and a standard detector, respectively. The
    absolute expanded uncertainty of this method is estimated to be 0.05% (with a
    coverage factor of <italic>k</italic> = 2) for spectral irradiance responsivity
    calibrations, and the dominant uncertainty contribution is from the reference
    trap detector.</p>"
