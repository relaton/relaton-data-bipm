abstract:
- content: "<p>The spectral responsivity of a predictable quantum efficient detector
    (PQED) is calculated based on the responsivity of an ideal quantum detector and
    taking into account reflection losses from the surface of the photodiode and internal
    charge-carrier gains/losses inside the diode. The internal quantum deficiency
    (IQD) is obtained from simulations with the PC1D software using the material data
    of the produced PQED photodiodes. The results indicate that at room temperature
    the predicted IQD of the PQED is close to zero with an uncertainty of about 100 ppm
    over the visible range. It is further concluded that a primary standard of visible
    optical power with an uncertainty of approximately 1 ppm is achievable using the
    PQED at low temperatures.</p>"
