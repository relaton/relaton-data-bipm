abstract:
- content: "<p>We present a system for luminous efficacy measurements of solid-state
    lamps (SSLs). It is based on a 1.65 m integrating sphere, originally designed
    for luminous flux measurements of dc-operated incandescent standard lamps. The
    sphere was slightly modified, and equipped with a programmable ac-power supply,
    as well as equipment for electrical power measurement of the lamps. The waveforms
    of both the electrical power and the luminous flux can be measured for analysing
    the quality of the electronics and the light produced by the SSLs. A goniospectrometer
    is used for angular characterization of the lamp intensity. Luminous efficacy
    test measurements were conducted for a group of 25 SSLs of different types. Special
    attention was paid to the spectral, spatial and self-absorption corrections to
    obtain low measurement uncertainty. The luminous efficacies were between 25 lm W<sup>−1</sup>
    and 64 lm W<sup>−1</sup>, and the total harmonic distortions of the current waveforms
    were in the range of 30% to 280%. Depending on the lamp, the maximum deviation
    of the flux from its mean value was 0.06% to 105%. The relative expanded uncertainty
    obtainable for the luminous efficacy of a typical SSL with stable built-in electronics
    is 1.2% ( k  = 2).</p>"
