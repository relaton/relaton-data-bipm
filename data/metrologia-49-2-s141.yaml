abstract:
- content: "<p>In this paper, we present the near-field goniophotometer setup recently
    installed at PTB for the photometric characterization of solid-state light sources,
    e.g. LEDs, under near-field conditions. Moreover, as a validation of the near-field
    goniophotometric measurements, the luminous intensity distribution of two LEDs
    determined by near-field measurements is also presented and compared with those
    carried out separately under far-field conditions using a photometer.</p>"
