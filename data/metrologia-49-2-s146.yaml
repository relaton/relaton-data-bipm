  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has set up the 630 MeV
    electron storage ring Metrology Light Source (MLS) in close cooperation with the
    Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB). This electron storage ring has been in regular
    user operation since April 2008. It is dedicated to synchrotron-radiation-based
    metrology and technological developments in the far-IR/THz, IR, UV, VUV and EUV
    spectral ranges, with the use as primary source standard as the key activity.
    In a permanent process of improvement, the storage ring itself was optimized regarding
    its regular performance (beam current and lifetime) as well as for special operations
    (e.g. variable electron energies and electron bunch lengths). The measurement
    capabilities at the seven different beamline ports were set up sequentially, first
    in the UV/VUV and IR spectral ranges. This first phase of instrumentation set-up
    will be finished in 2011 by completing the beamlines for EUV metrology, for the
    calibration of radiation sources and for the application of undulator radiation.</p>"
