abstract:
- content: "<p>Retrieval of operational optical products from the future Global Monitoring
    for Environment and Security (GMES) Sentinel-3 mission aims to provide continuity
    of existing missions delivering ocean/land colour, surface temperature and sea
    surface topography data. This paper describes the current status of the Sentinel-3
    Level 2 Optical Prototype Processor (O-L2PP) whose development includes not only
    a list of products, but also associated uncertainty estimatesâ€”a key requirement
    for the processor. Examples of the approaches adopted within the Ocean and Land
    Colour Instrument (OLCI) processing module demonstrate how uncertainties can be
    estimated.</p>"
