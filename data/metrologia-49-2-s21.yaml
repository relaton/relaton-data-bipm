  content: "<p>A significant problem facing the optical satellite calibration community
    is limited knowledge of the uncertainties associated with fundamental measurements,
    such as surface reflectance, used to derive satellite radiometric calibration
    estimates. In addition, it is difficult to compare the capabilities of calibration
    teams around the globe, which leads to differences in the estimated calibration
    of optical satellite sensors. This paper reports on two recent field campaigns
    that were designed to isolate common uncertainties within and across calibration
    groups, particularly with respect to ground-based surface reflectance measurements.
    Initial results from these efforts suggest the uncertainties can be as low as
    1.5% to 2.5%. In addition, methods for improving the cross-comparison of calibration
    teams are suggested that can potentially reduce the differences in the calibration
    estimates of optical satellite sensors.</p>"
