abstract:
- content: "<p>Continuity of the 33-year long total solar irradiance record has been
    facilitated by corrections for offsets due to calibration differences between
    instruments, providing a solar data record with precision approaching that needed
    for Earth climate studies. Recent laboratory tests have (1) improved measurement
    absolute accuracy to mitigate potential future data gaps, (2) helped explain the
    causes of instrument offsets and (3) improved consistency between the international
    references upon which various instrument calibrations are based.</p>"
