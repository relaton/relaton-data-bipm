  content: "<p>We report the fourth World Radiometric Reference (WRR)-to-SI comparison.
    At the National Physical Laboratory we compared three transfer pyrheliometer instruments
    in power mode with the SI radiometric scale. Compared with the three previous
    comparisons, we improved the experiment by operating the transfer instruments
    in vacuum. At the Total solar irradiance Radiometer Facility (TRF) located at
    the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) in Boulder, we repeated
    the power comparison of one of the transfer instruments. The TRF also allowed
    the comparison and characterization of this instrument in irradiance mode. Using
    the WRR comparisons performed in Davos, we find that the WRR is 0.34% higher than
    the SI scale. Comparing irradiance mode calibrations with power mode calibrations
    reveals that previous estimates of stray light of PMO6-type radiometers were very
    low. The instrument calibrated at TRF was integrated in the space experiment PREMOS
    on the French satellite PICARD and carries the first vacuum irradiance calibration
    to space.</p>"
