  content: "<p>We introduce a technique for the measurement of femtosecond optical
    pulses. This technique significantly reduces the uncertainty coming from the filter
    when used in the traditional technique, and an accurate spectral phase is retrieved.
    With the retrieved phase, the electric field, phase, waveform, as well as the
    duration of femtosecond optical pulses can be precisely reconstructed. The simulated
    autocorrelation traces deduced from the reconstructed pulsed electric field are
    in good agreement with the measured ones. This technique removes the manual procedure
    of selection and adjustment of the filter, an automatic measurement being realized.</p>"
