abstract:
- content: "<p>An investigation of the short- and long-term stability of various low-end
    and high-end array spectroradiometers is presented. Potentially weak points of
    array spectroradiometers with respect to their suitability for absolute calibrations
    are pointed out. The influence of ambient conditions on relevant instrumental
    characteristics and their temporal stability is discussed. It is shown that the
    temporal stability of some instruments can be significantly affected by high ambient
    humidity. Most important ambient temperature effects on instrument properties
    are also discussed.</p>"
