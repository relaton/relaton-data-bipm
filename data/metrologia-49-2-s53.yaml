abstract:
- content: "<p>We have developed a physical model for the spectral behaviour of the
    radiation of tungsten filament lamps. The model is based on Planck's radiation
    law, published values for the emissivity of tungsten, measurement geometry and
    measured values for a residual correction function. In this paper, we study the
    physical interpretation of the model. The studied properties influencing the lamp
    spectra include the emissivity data used, light recycling effect due to the cylindrical
    shape of the filament, transmittance of the glass envelope and the halogen gas
    and temperature dependence of the transmittance. It appears that in addition to
    tungsten emissivity, one needs to account for the bulb transmittance and the light
    recycling within the cylindrical filament. We did not observe any wavelength dependence
    of the absorption of the filling gas.</p>"
