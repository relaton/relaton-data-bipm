  content: "<p>Three cells of the WC–C peritectic fixed point with a temperature of
    about 3021 K were built and investigated. Two different sources of tungsten with
    nominal purities of 5N and 3N were used, and two different filling techniques
    were applied. There was no difference in plateau shapes between the cells. The
    3N purity cell showed a small difference (0.22 K) in the melting temperature from
    the 5N cell, which indicates significant purification of initially contaminated
    tungsten. The typical melting range and repeatability of the observed peritectic
    melting plateaux were 100 mK and 15 mK, respectively. The melting point was stable
    and reproducible within 25 mK per two weeks. <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> temperature
    of the WC–C melting point was found to be (2747.6 ± 1.1) °C (<italic>k</italic>
    = 2). The observed freezing plateaux were flat and repeatable within 50 mK and
    15 mK, respectively. The WC<sub>1−<italic>x</italic></sub>–WC eutectic transition
    showed a melting temperature about 29 K lower than the peritectic one with a repeatability
    of about 0.2 K. The problem of deep supercooling is discussed and a method for
    its solution is shown and tested.</p>"
