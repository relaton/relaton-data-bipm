abstract:
- content: "<p>The Schott series of NG glasses are frequently used to manufacture
    neutral density transmittance standards for validation of spectrophotometer systems
    as well as for comparisons of regular spectral transmittance scales. A study has
    been made of the temperature and temporal dependence of transmittance in these
    types of filters. The temperature dependence of transmittance is found to scale
    as âˆ’ln(T). The filter transmittance was found to vary significantly with time
    shortly after manufacture but appears to be stabilizing nine months after beginning
    measurements.</p>"
