  content: "<p>The Schott series of NG glasses are frequently used to manufacture
    neutral density transmittance standards for validation of spectrophotometer systems
    as well as for comparisons of regular spectral transmittance scales. A study has
    been made of the temperature and temporal dependence of transmittance in these
    types of filters. The temperature dependence of transmittance is found to scale
    as âˆ’ln(<italic>T</italic>). The filter transmittance was found to vary significantly
    with time shortly after manufacture but appears to be stabilizing nine months
    after beginning measurements.</p>"
