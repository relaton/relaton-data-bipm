abstract:
- content: "<p>The directional–hemispherical reflectance measurement facility at the
    National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has recently been upgraded. Improvements to
    the facility include replacement of the grating spectrophotometer with a Fourier
    transform spectrometer (FTS), minimization and correcting for the effects of heating
    of the test sample, better alignment (using visible radiation), the use of an
    intermediate field stop, and correcting for instrumental and relay optics drift
    by using a blackbody. Measurements obtained with the new facility are presented
    and discussed.</p>"
