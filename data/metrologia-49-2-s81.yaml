  content: "<p>We have measured the polarization-resolved bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) for two types of graphite used in the fabrication
    of high-temperature fixed point blackbody cavities in and out of the plane of
    incidence. Measurements were made at room temperature using 405 nm and 658 nm
    laser sources, and the samples were illuminated at angles of incidence varying
    from normal incidence to 70°. All of the samples exhibited non-Lambertian behaviour,
    including enhanced forward scatter at high incident angles, especially for s-polarized
    incident light. The directional-hemispherical reflectance for unpolarized incident
    light, obtained by integrating the BRDF measured at individual points in a hemisphere
    over the sample, ranged from 0.083 to 0.101, depending upon sample and incident
    angle. The potential impact of these measurements on emissivity models for graphite
    blackbody radiators and radiance temperature scale dissemination is discussed.</p>"
