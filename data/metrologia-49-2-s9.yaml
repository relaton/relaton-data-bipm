abstract:
- content: "<p>The All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements
    is currently carrying out a project on developing an integrated system for measurement
    assurance of Earth observations. The system should provide ground calibration
    of instruments and their control during space-borne observations. Such tasks require
    appropriate measurement facilities as well as regulatory documentation. In this
    paper we discuss the newly created radiometric facility, traceable to SI standard,
    for precise calibration of instruments for Earth observations, the project on
    precise monitoring of the stability of the instrument's in-flight performance
    and the development of national regulatory documentation in harmony with the international
    document ‘Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation—QA4EO’.</p>"
