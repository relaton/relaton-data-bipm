abstract:
- content: "<p>A cryogenic radiometer was constructed for direct-substitution optical-fibre
    power measurements. The cavity is intended to operate at the 3 K temperature stage
    of a dilution refrigerator or 4.2 K stage of a liquid cryostat. The optical fibre
    is removable for characterization. The cavity features micromachined silicon centring
    rings to thermally isolate the optical fibre as well as an absorber made from
    micromachined silicon on which vertically aligned carbon nanotubes were grown.
    Measurements of electrical substitution, optical absorption and temperature change
    indicate that the radiometer is capable of measuring a power level of 10 nW with
    approximate responsivity of 155 nW K<sup>−1</sup> and 1/e time constant of 13 min.
    An inequivalence between optical and electrical power of approximately 10% was
    found, but the difference was largely attributable to unaccounted losses in the
    optical fibre.</p>"
