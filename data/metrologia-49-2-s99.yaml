  content: "<p>The linearity-of-response characteristics of a photovoltaic (PV) HgCdTe
    detector were investigated at a number of wavelengths in the infrared, using the
    NPL linearity of detector response characterization facility. The measurements
    were performed with the test detector operating under conditions identical to
    those in which the detectors will be used in typical infrared radiometric applications.
    The deviation from linearity in the generated photocurrent was shown to be strongly
    dependent on the area of the detector being illuminated. Plots of the linearity
    factor versus generated photocurrent for different illuminated wavelengths were
    shown to overlap. The linearity factor was shown to be a function of the photon
    irradiance of the illuminating beam. This behaviour was similar to that exhibited
    by photoconductive (PC) HgCdTe detectors, indicating that Auger recombination
    was the dominant source of the deviation from linearity observed in the test detector.</p>"
