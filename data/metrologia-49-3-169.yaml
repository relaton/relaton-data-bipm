abstract:
- content: "<p>We propose an implementation of the straight-line fit algorithm to
    evaluate data obtained as part of measurements of line structures, e.g. a grating
    line, which allows us to determine, at a conventional threshold value, the coordinates
    of the edges, the position and the width of its photometric profile as well as
    the related standard uncertainty contribution. These are derived for the (1 −
    α)100% confidence intervals with α ∊ [0, 1]. The implementation is demonstrated
    using data obtained by the PTB Nanometer Comparator (Fluegge and Köning 2001 Proc.
    SPIE 4401 275–83). The investigation revealed that large parts of the uncertainty
    of the position and the width of the line are due to the choice of the fit interval
    and the uncertainty of the determination of the minimum and maximum level of the
    photoelectric signal of the line.</p>"
