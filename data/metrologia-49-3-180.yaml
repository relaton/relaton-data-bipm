- language: en

  content: "<p>The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has substantially improved
    the quality of its local time scale UTC(PTB), which is the national realization
    of the international time reference Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It serves
    as the basis for PTB's time services, for local clock comparisons and for international
    time comparisons. Since February 2010 UTC(PTB) has been realized using an active
    hydrogen maser (AHM) steered in frequency via a phase micro-stepper according
    to an algorithm which combines the frequency comparison data between the AHM and
    primary and commercial caesium clocks of PTB. Thereby the long-term stability
    and accuracy of PTB's primary clocks, in particular its fountain clock CSF1, were
    combined with the short-term frequency stability of the AHM. CSF1 data were used
    to calculate the steering on all but six days during 15 months. During the time
    between July 2010 and July 2011, the time difference between UTC(PTB) and UTC
    was always less than 6 ns and the monthly mean rate differences never exceeded
    0.16 ns per day.</p>"
