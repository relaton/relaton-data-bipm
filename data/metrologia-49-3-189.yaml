  content: "<p>The future <italic>mise en pratique</italic> for the realization of
    the kelvin will be founded on the melting temperatures of particular metal–carbon
    eutectic alloys as thermodynamic temperature references. However, at the moment
    there is no consensus on what should be taken as the melting temperature. An ideal
    melting or freezing curve should be a completely flat plateau at a specific temperature.
    Any departure from the ideal is due to shortcomings in the realization and should
    be accommodated within the uncertainty budget. However, for the proposed alloy-based
    fixed points, melting takes place over typically some hundreds of millikelvins.
    Including the entire melting range within the uncertainties would lead to an unnecessarily
    pessimistic view of the utility of these as reference standards. Therefore, detailed
    analysis of the shape of the melting curve is needed to give a value associated
    with some identifiable aspect of the phase transition. A range of approaches are
    or could be used; some purely practical, determining the point of inflection (POI)
    of the melting curve, some attempting to extrapolate to the liquidus temperature
    just at the end of melting, and a method that claims to give the liquidus temperature
    and an impurity correction based on the analytical Scheil model of solidification
    that has not previously been applied to eutectic melting. The different methods
    have been applied to cobalt–carbon melting curves that were obtained under conditions
    for which the Scheil model might be valid. In the light of the findings of this
    study it is recommended that the POI continue to be used as a pragmatic measure
    of temperature but where required a specified limits approach should be used to
    define and determine the melting temperature.</p>"
