abstract:
- content: "<p>The future mise en pratique for the realization of the kelvin will
    be founded on the melting temperatures of particular metal–carbon eutectic alloys
    as thermodynamic temperature references. However, at the moment there is no consensus
    on what should be taken as the melting temperature. An ideal melting or freezing
    curve should be a completely flat plateau at a specific temperature. Any departure
    from the ideal is due to shortcomings in the realization and should be accommodated
    within the uncertainty budget. However, for the proposed alloy-based fixed points,
    melting takes place over typically some hundreds of millikelvins. Including the
    entire melting range within the uncertainties would lead to an unnecessarily pessimistic
    view of the utility of these as reference standards. Therefore, detailed analysis
    of the shape of the melting curve is needed to give a value associated with some
    identifiable aspect of the phase transition. A range of approaches are or could
    be used; some purely practical, determining the point of inflection (POI) of the
    melting curve, some attempting to extrapolate to the liquidus temperature just
    at the end of melting, and a method that claims to give the liquidus temperature
    and an impurity correction based on the analytical Scheil model of solidification
    that has not previously been applied to eutectic melting. The different methods
    have been applied to cobalt–carbon melting curves that were obtained under conditions
    for which the Scheil model might be valid. In the light of the findings of this
    study it is recommended that the POI continue to be used as a pragmatic measure
    of temperature but where required a specified limits approach should be used to
    define and determine the melting temperature.</p>"
