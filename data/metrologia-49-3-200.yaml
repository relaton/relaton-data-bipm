abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper reports work undertaken to investigate the stability of
    platinum–iridium mass standards stored in vacuum. Mass standards manufactured
    from platinum–iridium were stored in vacuum over a period of 42 months and their
    stability compared with that of similar standards stored in air. Additionally,
    x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the surfaces of coupons
    stored alongside the mass standards in order to characterize changes in the contamination
    overlayer on the weights and correlate this with the measured changes in the mass
    of the standards. The stability of weights in air and in vacuum was broadly similar
    over the period of the test. However, the regular transfer of weights between
    the two media has been shown to significantly increase the rate of contaminant
    accretion. There was good correlation between the determination of overlayer accretion
    by XPS and that measured gravimetrically.</p>"
