  content: "<p>Helium–neon ring laser gyroscopes have been observed to produce a stable
    and useful Sagnac beat signal while operating with multiple longitudinal modes
    through a mode-locking mechanism. The parameter space pertaining to stable operation
    with respect to gas pressure and intra-cavity power has been explored experimentally.
    Two regions of stability have been identified. The stability of large ring lasers
    operating with mode-locking has been characterized. Mode-locked operation presents
    no statistically significant difference in performance compared with single-mode
    operation. It is shown that the time required for establishing stable mode-coupled
    operation can be a practical disadvantage for the ultra-large ring lasers.</p>"
