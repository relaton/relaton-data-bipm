abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper presents the description and the characterization of the
    gonio-spectrophotometer GEFE (the acronym for ‘Gonio-EspectroFotómetro Español’).
    This device has been designed and built for the low-uncertainty absolute measurement
    of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). It comprises a
    fixed, collimated and uniform light source, a six-axis robot-arm to rotate the
    sample and a spectroradiometer that may revolve around the sample to be able to
    vary the source-to-detector angular separation. This gonio-spectrophotometer makes
    it possible to perform spectral measurements in the visible range, both inside
    and outside the incidence plane, as well as measurements in retroreflection conditions.
    This fully automated system is able to measure autonomously a sample's complete
    spectral BRDF (comprising around 1000 different angular configurations) in less
    than 4 h.</p>"
