  content: "<p>A procedure for dynamic force calibration using sinusoidal excitations
    of force transducers is described. The method is based on a sinusoidal excitation
    of force transducers equipped with an additional top mass excited with an electrodynamic
    shaker system. The acting dynamic force can in this way be determined according
    to Newton's law as mass times acceleration, whereby the acceleration is measured
    on the surface of the top mass with the aid of laser interferometers. The dynamic
    sensitivity, which is the ratio of the electrical output signal of the force transducer
    and the acting dynamic force, is the main point of interest of such a dynamic
    calibration. In addition to the sensitivity, the parameter stiffness and damping
    of the transducer can also be determined. The first part of the paper outlines
    a mathematical model to describe the dynamic behaviour of a transducer. This is
    followed by a presentation of the traceability of the measured quantities involved
    and their uncertainties. The paper finishes with an example calibration of a 25 kN
    strain gauge force transducer.</p>"
