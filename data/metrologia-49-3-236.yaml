abstract:
- content: "<p>A two-dimensional grating can be used as a key component in planar
    encoders for measuring two-dimensional displacements or calibrating coordinate
    measuring machines. Ideally the two main periodic directions of the grating, the
    directions along which a translation by a grating period leaves the two-dimensional
    pattern indistinguishable from the untranslated one, should be perfectly orthogonal;
    any deviation from orthogonality causes cross-talk errors and necessitates system
    calibration. We present a method to measure the orthogonality, or the non-orthogonality
    angle of two-dimensional gratings precisely. This method uses interference fringes
    generated by diffracted beams of different orders to align the grating's periodic
    directions, and applies a new measurement strategy to directly measure the non-orthogonality
    angle by an autocollimator. Compared with traditional optical diffractometry,
    its angular position alignment is of higher sensitivity and its angle measurement
    is of lower uncertainty, and the measurement uncertainty is reduced. Orthogonalities
    of four gratings were measured and the standard uncertainty was 0.28â€‰arcsec. The
    results agree well with the measurement results of optical diffractometry.</p>"
