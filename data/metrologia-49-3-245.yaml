abstract:
- content: "<p>We have measured the internal volume of a 1 litre, diamond-turned copper
    quasispherical resonator with a fractional uncertainty of approximately 1 part
    in 10<sup>6</sup> using two independent techniques. This is in response to the
    need for a uniquely accurate measurement of resonator volume, for the purpose
    of measuring the Boltzmann constant in pursuit of the redefinition of the kelvin.
    The first technique is a pyknometric measurement using water as a liquid of known
    density. We describe the development of a procedure that results in stable, reproducible
    volume measurements. We provide a detailed discussion of the factors that affect
    the water density, such as dissolved gases. The second technique is microwave
    resonance spectroscopy. Here, we measure the resonant frequencies of the TM<sub>1n</sub>
    modes and relate them to the dimensions of the resonator. We evaluate the frequency
    perturbations that arise from the coupling waveguides and the electrical resistivity
    of the copper surface. The results of the microwave measurements show evidence
    of a dielectric coating on the surface. We propose that this is an oxide layer
    and estimate its thickness from the microwave data. Finally, we compare the volume
    estimates from the two methods, and find that the difference is within the combined
    uncertainty.</p>"
