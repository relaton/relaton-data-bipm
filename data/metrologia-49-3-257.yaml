abstract:
- content: "<p>An overview of the results of an international star intercomparison
    of low-temperature fixed points is given. Between 1997 and 2005, 68 sealed triple-point
    cells (STPCs) of the twelve laboratories represented by the authors were investigated
    at PTB. The STPCs are used to realize the triple points of hydrogen, neon, oxygen
    and argon as defining fixed points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990,
    ITS-90. The melting curves (MCs) of all STPCs have been measured on the same experimental
    equipment, adhering strictly to a single measurement program. This protocol enables
    separation of the effects influencing the MCs and direct comparison of the thermal
    behaviour of the STPCs, which are quite different with respect to design, age,
    gas source and filling technology. In the paper, special emphasis is given to
    the spread of the liquidus-point temperatures and to the uncertainty of their
    determination. Connections between the star intercomparison and completed and
    ongoing international activities are also discussed.</p>"
