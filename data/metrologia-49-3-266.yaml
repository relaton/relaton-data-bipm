abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A novel automatic bridge linking capacitance and resistance
    has been developed. This bridge with only one 10 nF capacitance and one 10 kΩ
    resistance standard, operating at 1592 Hz, is implemented based on digital compensation
    techniques. The standards are all defined as four terminal-pair impedances. All
    voltages applied to the bridge are generated by a multiphase direct-digital-synthesis
    sine wave source, a special channel of which provided accurate phase and constant
    amplitude when the phase is changed. In contrast with the conventional quadrature
    bridge, a lot of inductive dividers and a series of balancing processes are avoided.
    Preliminary experimental results indicate a relative uncertainty of four parts
    in 10<sup>7</sup> is obtained and could be improved further.</p>
