    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We present two detector-based realizations of the absolute integrating sphere method for luminous-flux measurement. A large-size realization with a sphere diameter of 2 m is applied to high-flux lamps above 1000 lm, and a small-size realization with a sphere diameter of 0.3 m to low-flux lamps below 100 lm. The uncertainty of both realizations is analysed with a focus on the systematic effect in the spatial mismatch correction, and evaluated to be 1.2% and 1.1% (<italic>k</italic> = 2) for the large-size and small-size realizations, respectively. Comparison with a goniophotometer using two different types of lamp artefacts for both cases has verified the validity of the realization within the comparison uncertainty.</p>
