abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A bilateral comparison of refractive index measurements between
    the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and the Istituto Nazionale di
    Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) was carried out in 2008. Each laboratory developed
    a measurement system based on different principles. NMIJ's system was based on
    the interferometric technique and INRiM's system was based on a modified method
    of the traditional refractive technique. A comparison using a prism-shaped glass
    made of OHARA BSL7Y was carried out in order to evaluate the newly developed methods
    and confirm the consistency of the results. The details of the comparison artefacts,
    measurement conditions and uncertainty factors and their degrees of freedom of
    each laboratory are described here. The measurement results for the glass at 633 nm
    at 20 °C and 23 °C are within each laboratory's claimed expanded uncertainty (coverage
    factor k = 2) which was of the order of 10<sup>−6</sup>. The agreement between
    the two different measurement approaches shows that both systems can be used to
    obtain accurate measurements.</p>
