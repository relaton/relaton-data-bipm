abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Volume is an input quantity in the measurement model for the
    mass of a body, say, a mass standard. The classical method to determine volume,
    hydrostatic weighing, is time-consuming, expensive and can introduce instability
    in the standard mass. Some years ago an alternative method was proposed, based
    on weighings in air at different densities. We generalize the method, showing
    that also the mass of the standard can be determined with it using a weighted-least-squares
    adjustment. To this purpose, we discuss a measurement model taking into account
    the covariances between the input estimates. The method, experimentally validated,
    yields uncertainties for the mass estimates that are smaller than those obtained
    with the traditional method, and gives the further advantage of directly providing
    the covariance between mass and volume.</p>
