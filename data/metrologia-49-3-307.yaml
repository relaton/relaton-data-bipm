abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Gauge blocks (GBs) are very important material standards that
    provide industry with reliable and traceable standards of length. At the highest
    accuracy level, the measurement of GBs must be performed by interferometry. The
    double ended interferometer (DEI) offers an alternative to obtain traceable measurements
    of the absolute length of GB shaped objects without the need for a platen to be
    wrung to one of the faces. In spite of this general advantage, there is no reliable
    DEI system being used at any National Metrology Institute (NMI). PTB, as the NMI
    of Germany, is developing a dedicated DEI which will be situated in a temperature-stabilized
    vacuum chamber. This paper describes a preliminary prototype DEI that was built
    firstly to study the measurement principle, and secondly to learn about the challenges
    and limitations to be taken into consideration for the final design. A comparison
    of results from the DEI measurements and those from PTB's existing single ended
    GB interferometers (SEI) indicates that the present prototype is a basis for the
    final version.</p>
