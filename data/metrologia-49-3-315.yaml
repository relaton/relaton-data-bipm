abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Leaks in a pressure calibration system should be as small as
    possible in order to reduce the pressure difference between the pressure standard
    and the device under test (DUT). However, a pressure calibration system that is
    perfectly sealed from the external environment does not exist, and a pressure
    difference due to leakage can affect the calibration results. This type of effect
    should be evaluated precisely because DUTs, such as precise digital pressure gauges
    with resolutions of less than 1 part in 10<sup>6</sup>, are used widely in industry
    and the pressure difference due to the leak effect is expected to be larger than
    the resolution of the DUTs. In addition, precise digital pressure gauges for intercomparisons
    have been used as transfer standards to determine the degree of equivalence of
    pressure measurement standards among national measurement institutes (NMIs). This
    paper explores the leak effect using a leak control valve when a precise digital
    pressure gauge is calibrated using a pressure balance up to 100 kPa in an absolute
    mode. Experiments were performed according to an applied pressure, leak amount,
    tube length and pressure media. It is concluded that the uncertainty caused by
    a possible leak should be included in the uncertainty evaluation of the calibration
    results.</p>
