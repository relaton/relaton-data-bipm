    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The acoustic output power produced by medical ultrasound equipment is a key quantity representing the safety of exposure to ultrasound during diagnostic or therapeutic applications. At present the widely used method for estimating the total output power from ultrasound sources is by measuring the radiation force using a gravimetric balance. The method described here is a non-radiation force method using a form of calorimetry where the average temperature change in a target filled with castor oil is inferred from its volume change. This method has been previously validated using a radiation force method at frequencies of 1 MHz and 3 MHz for acoustic powers in the range 1 W to 350 W. Estimated systematic uncertainty at the 95% confidence interval was 3.4% for a frequency of 1 MHz at 50 W measured power and typical overall uncertainties were of the order of 4%. The same method is extended and validated in the frequency range 3.151 MHz to 9.541 MHz using an improved target and applied powers in the range 100 mW to 1 W. The investigation of higher frequencies and modified data analysis has improved understanding of two important systematic effects. Firstly, heat loss from the front surface of the castor oil target: this was found to be a function of insonation time and increasingly significant at higher frequencies. Secondly, the effect of stored energy in a heating element inside the target which is used to calibrate the system by electrical heating: this could be significant for heating times less than 20 s. At a 95% confidence level, the estimated systematic uncertainty in the measured power with the improved target is 2.6% for 50 W acoustic power at a frequency of 3 MHz.</p>
