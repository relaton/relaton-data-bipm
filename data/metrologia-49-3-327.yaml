abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The acoustic output power produced by medical ultrasound equipment
    is a key quantity representing the safety of exposure to ultrasound during diagnostic
    or therapeutic applications. At present the widely used method for estimating
    the total output power from ultrasound sources is by measuring the radiation force
    using a gravimetric balance. The method described here is a non-radiation force
    method using a form of calorimetry where the average temperature change in a target
    filled with castor oil is inferred from its volume change. This method has been
    previously validated using a radiation force method at frequencies of 1 MHz and
    3 MHz for acoustic powers in the range 1 W to 350 W. Estimated systematic uncertainty
    at the 95% confidence interval was 3.4% for a frequency of 1 MHz at 50 W measured
    power and typical overall uncertainties were of the order of 4%. The same method
    is extended and validated in the frequency range 3.151 MHz to 9.541 MHz using
    an improved target and applied powers in the range 100 mW to 1 W. The investigation
    of higher frequencies and modified data analysis has improved understanding of
    two important systematic effects. Firstly, heat loss from the front surface of
    the castor oil target: this was found to be a function of insonation time and
    increasingly significant at higher frequencies. Secondly, the effect of stored
    energy in a heating element inside the target which is used to calibrate the system
    by electrical heating: this could be significant for heating times less than 20 s.
    At a 95% confidence level, the estimated systematic uncertainty in the measured
    power with the improved target is 2.6% for 50 W acoustic power at a frequency
    of 3 MHz.</p>'
