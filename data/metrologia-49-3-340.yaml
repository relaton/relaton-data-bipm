abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Analysis of CIPM international comparisons is increasingly being
    carried out using a model-based approach that leads naturally to a generalized
    least-squares (GLS) solution. While this method offers the advantages of being
    easier to audit and having general applicability to any form of comparison protocol,
    there is a lack of consensus over aspects of its implementation. Two significant
    results are presented that show the equivalence of three differing approaches
    discussed by or applied in comparisons run by Consultative Committees of the CIPM.
    Both results depend on a mathematical condition equivalent to the requirement
    that any two artefacts in the comparison are linked through a sequence of measurements
    of overlapping pairs of artefacts. The first result is that a GLS estimator excluding
    all sources of error common to all measurements of a participant is equal to the
    GLS estimator incorporating all sources of error, including those associated with
    any bias in the standards or procedures of the measuring laboratory. The second
    result identifies the component of uncertainty in the estimate of bias that arises
    from possible systematic effects in the participants' measurement standards and
    procedures. The expression so obtained is a generalization of an expression previously
    published for a one-artefact comparison with no inter-participant correlations,
    to one for a comparison comprising any number of repeat measurements of multiple
    artefacts and allowing for inter-laboratory correlations.</p>
