abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A numerical model of solute and heat transport in extremely
    pure materials is described. Its purpose is to characterize the effect of impurities
    on the freezing curves of metals containing impurities at the level of less than
    1 part per million. It is used to simulate experiments performed using a commercially
    available zinc fixed-point cell for SPRT calibrations. The aim is to determine
    the effect of different vertical temperature gradients on the freezing curve and
    to find out whether a range of conditions could be determined where there was
    a good fit between theory and experiment. For this fixed-point cell, agreement
    between the model and experiment improves as the distribution coefficient k → 0.
    It is found that the model only agrees with the measured freezing curves over
    the entire freeze for a narrow range of furnace settings where the temperature
    profile is most uniform. We suggest that this is because if the furnace settings
    are not optimized, the solid does not grow uniformly, and freezing may continue
    in regions remote from the SPRT after the material in the vicinity of the SPRT
    has finished freezing, so distorting the freezing curve. This effect is not present
    in the model and so the method presented here enables optimization of the furnace
    to ensure the SPRT is surrounded by a liquid–solid interface over the entire freezing
    range. We find that the optimum thermal environment is extremely sensitive to
    the furnace settings; the optimum thermal environment is found when the temperature
    is slightly cooler at the top of the cell, as measured in the re-entrant well
    of the cell. We note that optimizing the freezing process is a necessary step
    towards using a thermal analysis to correct for the effects of impurities in the
    sample.</p>
