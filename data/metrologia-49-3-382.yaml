abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We propose a method for assigning a probability distribution
    to an input quantity. The distribution is used in a Monte Carlo method described
    in Supplement 1 to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement for
    uncertainty evaluation. The proposed method provides an alternative to other methods,
    such as the principle of maximum entropy and Bayesian procedure that were used
    in Supplement 1 for the same purpose. The method is based on an exact or approximate
    pivotal quantity and is easily applied. We use several examples from commonly
    known models to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach.</p>
