    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A statistical analysis for interlaboratory comparisons with linear trends in multiple loops is proposed. This approach can be applied to comparisons with multiple artefacts in multiple loops. The uncertainties for the comparison reference values and the degrees of equivalence are also provided. As an example, the approach is applied to the SIM.EM-S2 Energy Comparison.</p>
