abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The half-integer quantum Hall effect in epitaxial graphene is
    compared with high precision to the well-known integer effect in a GaAs/AlGaAs
    heterostructure. We find no difference between the quantized resistance values
    within the relative standard uncertainty of our measurement of 8.7 × 10<sup>−11</sup>.
    The result places new tighter limits on any possible correction terms to the simple
    relation  R<sub>K</sub> =  h / e<sup>2</sup>, and also demonstrates that epitaxial
    graphene samples are suitable for application as electrical resistance standards
    of the highest metrological quality. We discuss the characterization of the graphene
    sample used in this experiment and present the details of the cryogenic current
    comparator bridge and associated uncertainty budget.</p>
