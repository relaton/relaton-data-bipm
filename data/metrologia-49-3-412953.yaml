abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Ear simulators are important measurement devices for characterizing
    the performance and acoustic output of earphones and other transducers designed
    to be coupled to human ears. For best practice in the use of these devices it
    is important that the acoustic transfer impedance is periodically tested against
    published specification. This practice has been facilitated by IEC 60318-1 : 2009,
    where a test method has been specified. This paper reports an alternative method
    offering simplifications in concept and implementation, and leads to improved
    measurement uncertainty. A comparison of impedance measurements on a sample of
    ear simulators shows that the two methods produce equivalent results, and that
    the proposed method offers a viable alternative to that given in IEC 60318-1.</p>
