abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The multivariate Gaussian model is frequently applied in metrology
    and many other fields. Notably, the recent Supplement 2 to the GUM (an extension
    of GUM and GUM S1 to multivariate problems) makes extensive use of multivariate
    normal distributions. Frequently, the mean and the covariance of this distribution
    have to be estimated from observations. If no additional knowledge is available
    in these situations, a non-informative prior distribution has to be specified
    for a Bayesian estimation.</p><p>Since many paradigms exist according to which
    a non-informative prior distribution can be chosen, we will identify the influence
    that selected priors have on the marginal posterior and on the measurement uncertainty
    of the multivariate normal expectation. Neither the distribution itself nor its
    parameters are robust to standard choices of non-informative prior distributions
    for small and medium-sized samples. The length of posterior credible intervals
    may differ by a factor of two or more.</p>
