abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>A systematic study of the application of a novel pyroelectric
    technique to the measurement of diagnostic-level medical ultrasound output power
    is described. The method exploits the pyroelectric properties of a 0.028 mm thick
    membrane of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), backed by an acoustic absorber whose
    ultrasonic absorption coefficient approaches 1000 dB cm<sup>−1</sup> at 3 MHz.
    When exposed to an ultrasonic field, absorption of ultrasound adjacent to the
    PVDF–absorber interface results in heating and the generation of a pyroelectric
    output voltage across gold electrodes deposited on the membrane. For a sensor
    large enough to intercept the whole of the acoustic beam, the output voltage can
    be calibrated for the measurement of acoustic output power. A number of key performance
    properties of the method have been investigated. The technique is very sensitive,
    with a power to voltage conversion factor of typically 0.23 V W<sup>−1</sup>.
    The frequency response of a particular embodiment of the sensor in which acoustic
    power reflected at the absorber–PVDF interface is subsequently returned to the
    pyroelectric membrane to be absorbed, has been evaluated over the frequency range
    1.5 MHz to 10 MHz. This has shown the frequency response to be flat to within
    ±4%, above 2.5 MHz. Below this frequency, the sensitivity falls by 20% at 1.5 MHz.
    Linearity of the technique has been demonstrated to within ±1.6% for applied acoustic
    power levels from 1 mW up to 120 mW. A number of other studies targeted at assessing
    the achievable measurement uncertainties are presented. These involve: the effects
    of soaking, the influence of the angle of incidence of the acoustic beam, measurement
    repeatability and sensitivity to transducer positioning. Additionally, over the
    range 20 °C to 30 °C, the rate of change in sensitivity with ambient temperature
    has been shown to be +0.5% °C<sup>−1</sup>. Implications of the work for the development
    of a sensitive, traceable, portable, secondary method of ultrasound output power
    measurement, appropriate for clinical diagnostic ultrasound systems, are discussed.</p>'
