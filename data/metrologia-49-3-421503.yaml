abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A statistical analysis for interlaboratory comparisons with
    linear trends in multiple loops is proposed. This approach can be applied to comparisons
    with multiple artefacts in multiple loops. The uncertainties for the comparison
    reference values and the degrees of equivalence are also provided. As an example,
    the approach is applied to the SIM.EM-S2 Energy Comparison.</p>
