abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This letter calls for reconsidering the new definition of the
    mole, which has been proposed in the draft chapter 2 for the SI Brochure, posted
    on the BIPM website. It is argued that the list of particles should be deleted
    from the new definition of the mole. The necessary elements of the definition
    are summarized and another wording is suggested. Proposals to rename ‘amount of
    substance’ are briefly discussed.</p>
