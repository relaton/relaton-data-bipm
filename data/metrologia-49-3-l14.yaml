abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Supplement 1 to the GUM (GUM-S1) recommends the use of the maximum
    entropy principle (MaxEnt) in determining the probability distribution of a quantity
    having specified properties, e.g., specified central moments. When we only know
    the mean value and the variance of a variable, GUM-S1 prescribes a Gaussian probability
    distribution for that variable. When further information is available, in the
    form of a finite interval in which the variable is known to lie, we indicate how
    the distribution for the variable in this case can be obtained. A Gaussian distribution
    should only be used in this case when the standard deviation is small compared
    with the range of variation (the length of the interval). In general, when the
    interval is finite, the parameters of the distribution should be evaluated numerically,
    as suggested by Lira (2009 Metrologia 46 L27). Here we note that the knowledge
    of the range of variation is equivalent to a bias of the distribution towards
    a flat distribution in that range, and the principle of minimum Kullback entropy
    (mKE) should be used in the derivation of the probability distribution rather
    than the MaxEnt, thus leading to an exponential distribution with non-Gaussian
    features. Furthermore, up to evaluating the distribution negentropy, we quantify
    the deviation of mKE distributions from MaxEnt ones and, thus, we rigorously justify
    the use of the GUM-S1 recommendation also if we have further information on the
    range of variation of a quantity, namely, provided that its standard uncertainty
    is sufficiently small compared with the range.</p>
