abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the implementation and metrological characterization
    of a vapour-cell Rb frequency standard working in a pulsed regime. The three main
    parts of the clock, physics package, optics and electronics, are described in
    detail in this paper. The prototype is designed and optimized to detect the clock
    transition in the optical domain. Specifically, the reference atomic transition,
    excited with a Ramsey scheme, is detected by observing the interference pattern
    on a laser absorption signal.</p><p> The metrological analysis includes the observation
    and characterization of the clock signal and the measurement of frequency stability
    and drift. In terms of Allan deviation, the measured frequency stability is as
    low as 1.7 × 10<sup>−13</sup>τ<sup>−1/2</sup>, τ being the averaging time, and
    reaches the value of a few units of 10<sup>−15</sup> for τ = 10<sup>4</sup> s,
    an unprecedented result for a vapour-cell clock. We discuss the physical effects
    leading to this result in this paper with particular care to laser and microwave
    noises transferred to the clock signal. The frequency drift, probably related
    to temperature, stays below 10<sup>−14</sup> per day, and no evidence of flicker
    floor is observed.</p><p> We also mention some possible improvements that in principle
    would lead to a clock stability below the 10<sup>−13</sup> level at 1 s and to
    a drift of a few units of 10<sup>−15</sup> per day.</p>
