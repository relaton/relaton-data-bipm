abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The accuracy of a two-sample zero-crossing detection method
    is assessed by analytical uncertainty propagation and is verified in numerical
    simulations. Approximated expressions are given to evaluate uncertainty components
    due to linear interpolation, quantization, white noise and time jitter. The combined
    standard uncertainty of a detected zero phase is expressed as a function of the
    signal frequency, power of external noise and parameters of the digitizer used.
    The evaluation of the uncertainty of the measurand, derived from several detected
    zero-crossings, is illustrated with applications in frequency, displacement and
    free-fall acceleration measurements. The reported results can be used for uncertainty
    analysis and parameter optimization of a measurement system or a procedure, involving
    processing of sinusoidal signals.</p>
