abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The calculation of the phase correction and the associated uncertainty
    in the measurement of sphere diameters carried out by optical interferometers
    is of particular interest. With this view, a Gaussian-beam tracing method was
    utilized for application to the sphere-interferometer at the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan as it was used to measure the volume of the<sup>28</sup>Si
    spheres in the determination of the Avogadro constant. Monte Carlo simulations
    taking account also of possible interferometer misalignments reveal a correction
    and its uncertainty of 0.609(139)Â nm.</p>
