abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The concern is with key comparisons for which the participating
    laboratories provide measured data at each of a number of prescribed values of
    an auxiliary parameter, such as wavelength or frequency. Key comparison reference
    curves provide a continuous counterpart of the key comparison reference values
    (KCRVs) currently determined independently from the measured data relating to
    each value of the auxiliary parameter. They have the potential to provide a smoother
    realization of KCRVs across the interval of values of the auxiliary parameter
    and thus avoid the anomalous erratic sequences of KCRVs, associated standard uncertainties
    and degrees of equivalence that can be obtained otherwise. Key comparison reference
    curves may also help in assuring the consistency of statements of calibration
    and measurement capabilities with the results of key comparisons in cases where
    the former relate to a continuous interval of values of an auxiliary parameter
    and the latter to discrete values within the interval.</p>
