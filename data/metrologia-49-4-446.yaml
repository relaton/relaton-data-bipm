abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the preparation of some types of reference gas mixtures,
    one of the starting materials is a liquid. The liquid is introduced in the cylinder
    by means of a syringe. The weighing of these syringes before and after injection
    is critical for the calculation of the gas composition. A robot has been developed
    to facilitate this weighing of syringes used in the gravimetric preparation of
    these gas mixtures. From the validation work, it is clear that the robot performs
    the measurements more reliably and with better repeatability than the manual method.
    The percentage of non-conforming gas mixtures dropped from approximately 5% to
    less than 1%. Subsequent experiments to revisit assumptions made in the preparation
    process have gained new insight into effects such as convection and evaporation
    of liquid. Additional preventive measures are taken, to further improve the weighing
    accuracy, and by implication, the accuracy of the gas composition data calculated
    from preparation. The gain in uncertainty is different for various types of gas
    mixtures and depends largely on the thermophysical properties of the liquid and
    the gas mixture being prepared.</p>
