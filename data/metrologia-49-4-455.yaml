abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Six European National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) have joined
    forces within the European Metrology Research Programme funded project NANOTRACE
    to develop the next generation of optical interferometers having a target uncertainty
    of 10 pm. These are needed for NMIs to provide improved traceable dimensional
    metrology that can be disseminated to the wider nanotechnology community, thereby
    supporting the growth in nanotechnology. Several approaches were followed in order
    to develop the interferometers. This paper briefly describes the different interferometers
    developed by the various partners and presents the results of a comparison of
    performance of the optical interferometers using an x-ray interferometer to generate
    traceable reference displacements.</p>
