abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe a new method to determine the position of the atomic
    cloud during its interaction with the microwave field in the cavity of a fountain
    clock. The positional information is extracted from the spectrum of the |F = 3,
    m<sub>F</sub> = 0〉 to |F = 4, m<sub>F</sub> = −1〉 hyperfine transition, which
    shows a position-dependent asymmetry when the magnetic C-field is tilted by a
    few degrees with respect to the cavity axis. Analysis of this spectral asymmetry
    provides the horizontal centre-of-mass position for the ensemble of atoms contributing
    to frequency measurements. With an uncertainty of the order of 0.1 mm, the obtained
    information is useful for putting limits on the systematic uncertainty due to
    distributed cavity phase gradients. The validity of the new method is demonstrated
    through experimental evidence.</p>
