    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The calculation of the phase correction and the associated uncertainty in the measurement of sphere diameters carried out by optical interferometers is of particular interest. With this view, a Gaussian-beam tracing method was utilized for application to the sphere-interferometer at the National Metrology Institute of Japan as it was used to measure the volume of the <sup>28</sup>Si spheres in the determination of the Avogadro constant. Monte Carlo simulations taking account also of possible interferometer misalignments reveal a correction and its uncertainty of 0.609(139) nm.</p>
