    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>With a redefined kilogram fixing the Planck constant, <italic>h</italic>, and a redefined mole fixing the Avogadro constant, <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>, as recently proposed, retaining the carbon-12-based dalton creates a fundamental incompatibility in the stoichiometric equations. To avoid this incompatibility, the dalton should be redefined, as well: exactly in terms of the fixed-<italic>h</italic> kilogram. Specifically, with the mole defined as mol = <italic>N</italic><sup>*</sup>/<italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>, where <italic>N</italic><sup>*</sup> is an exact dimensionless constant, the dalton should be redefined as Da = (1/1000<italic>N</italic><sup>*</sup>) kg, exactly, so that <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>/mol<sup>−1</sup> remains exactly equal to the gram-to-dalton mass-unit ratio—as required by the fundamental compatibility condition relating the kilogram, mole and dalton. This would necessarily decouple the dalton from the carbon-12 reference mass, <italic>m</italic><sub>a</sub>(<sup>12</sup>C)/12, used for cataloguing nuclidic mass ratios to extremely high precision. Relative atomic masses, defined as <italic>A</italic><sub>r</sub>(X) = <italic>m</italic><sub>a</sub>(X)/Da, would then have uncertainties dominated by that of <italic>m</italic><sub>a</sub>(<sup>12</sup>C)/kg; but since this would be of order 10<sup>−9</sup> or less, the values of relative atomic masses, to the precision used in stoichiometry, would be totally unaffected. This is a much more straightforward and easily comprehended strategy than those using confusing inexact correction factors or the equivalent, as recommended in recent publications and implicitly endorsed by the CGPM.</p>
