abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>With a redefined kilogram fixing the Planck constant, h, and
    a redefined mole fixing the Avogadro constant, N<sub>A</sub>, as recently proposed,
    retaining the carbon-12-based dalton creates a fundamental incompatibility in
    the stoichiometric equations. To avoid this incompatibility, the dalton should
    be redefined, as well: exactly in terms of the fixed-h kilogram. Specifically,
    with the mole defined as mol = N<sup>*</sup>/N<sub>A</sub>, where N<sup>*</sup>
    is an exact dimensionless constant, the dalton should be redefined as Da = (1/1000N<sup>*</sup>) kg,
    exactly, so that N<sub>A</sub>/mol<sup>−1</sup> remains exactly equal to the gram-to-dalton
    mass-unit ratio—as required by the fundamental compatibility condition relating
    the kilogram, mole and dalton. This would necessarily decouple the dalton from
    the carbon-12 reference mass, m<sub>a</sub>(<sup>12</sup>C)/12, used for cataloguing
    nuclidic mass ratios to extremely high precision. Relative atomic masses, defined
    as A<sub>r</sub>(X) = m<sub>a</sub>(X)/Da, would then have uncertainties dominated
    by that of m<sub>a</sub>(<sup>12</sup>C)/kg; but since this would be of order
    10<sup>−9</sup> or less, the values of relative atomic masses, to the precision
    used in stoichiometry, would be totally unaffected. This is a much more straightforward
    and easily comprehended strategy than those using confusing inexact correction
    factors or the equivalent, as recommended in recent publications and implicitly
    endorsed by the CGPM.</p>'
