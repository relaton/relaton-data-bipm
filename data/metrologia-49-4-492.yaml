abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When the data do not conform to the hypothesis of a known sampling
    variance, the fitting of a constant to a set of measured values is a long debated
    problem. Given the data, fitting would require one to find what measurand value
    is the most trustworthy. Bayesian inference is reviewed here, to assign probabilities
    to the possible measurand values. Different hypotheses about the data variance
    are tested by Bayesian model comparison. Eventually, model selection is exemplified
    in deriving an estimate of the Planck constant.</p>
