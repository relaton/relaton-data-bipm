abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The first comparison of spectral responsivity scales in the
    soft x-ray region from 360 eV to 5000 eV has been carried out between the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
    and Technology (AIST). Two semiconductor photodiodes used as transfer detectors
    were calibrated using monochromatized synchrotron radiation and cryogenic electrical
    substitution radiometers as the primary detector standards at these institutes.
    The primary detector standard at AIST was confirmed to be in agreement with that
    at PTB at the level of the relative expanded uncertainty.</p>
