abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The use of a magnetic levitation densimeter (MLD) currently
    represents the most sensitive way of measuring fluid density for a wide range
    of temperature and pressure conditions. However, due to magnetic force transmission
    errors, the accuracy of this approach is limited to approximately 100 ppm in density.
    Here, the authors propose an improved method to eliminate the uncertainty caused
    by magnetic forces acting on fluids based on the use of dual sinkers and control
    of the magnetic coupling's levitation height. The technique cuts out almost all
    force transmission errors and enables a level of density measurement precision
    better than 1 ppm. A new high-sensitivity MLD system was developed using a novel
    sinker exchange mechanism with a magnetic coupling. Single-crystal silicon and
    germanium were selected as the sinker materials because of their outstanding performance
    in terms of isotropy, stability and universality of thermophysical properties.
    A number of tests to check the measurement performance of the MLD were conducted
    by the National Metrology Institute of Japan. The experimental results for n-tridecane
    are also presented in this paper.</p>
