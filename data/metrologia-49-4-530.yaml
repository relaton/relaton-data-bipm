abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The principle of quantitative magnetic analytical measurement
    using Curie's law is proposed as a future candidate for a new potential primary
    direct method of measurement for amount of substance. The targeted main analyte
    in a mixture sample is a species—a rare-earth ion or a transition-metal ion—that
    has a free quantum spin. The matrix of the mixture sample is diamagnetic. The
    spin number of the analyte can be obtained from the temperature dependence of
    the sample's magnetic moment. This analytical method uses differences in the temperature
    dependences of Langevin paramagnetism, which obeys Curie's law, and diamagnetism,
    which exhibits temperature-independent behaviour. For preliminary validation of
    this analytical method, powder mixture samples of gadolinium oxide in silicon
    oxide were prepared by a gravimetric blending method. The mass fractions of the
    prepared mixture samples were approximately 0.2 to 0.008. The values of the samples'
    magnetic moments at temperatures below 340 K were measured using a superconducting
    quantum interference device magnetometer. Each analytical concentration of gadolinium
    oxide determined by the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment was found
    to be consistent with the gravimetric concentration within a relative difference
    of approximately 10%.</p>
