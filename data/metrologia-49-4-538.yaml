abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A broadband primary standard for thermal noise measurements
    is presented and its thermal and electromagnetic behaviour is analysed by means
    of a novel hybrid analytical–numerical simulation methodology. The standard consists
    of a broadband termination connected to a 3.5 mm coaxial airline partially immersed
    in liquid nitrogen and is designed in order to obtain a low reflectivity and a
    low uncertainty in the noise temperature. A detailed sensitivity analysis is made
    in order to highlight the critical characteristics that mostly affect the uncertainty
    in the noise temperature, and also to determine the manufacturing and operation
    tolerances for a proper performance in the range 10 MHz to 26.5 GHz. Aspects such
    as the thermal bead design, the level of liquid nitrogen or the uncertainties
    associated with the temperatures, the physical properties of the materials in
    the standard and the simulation techniques are discussed.</p>
