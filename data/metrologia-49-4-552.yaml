abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>FG5 absolute gravimeters are the most accurate gravimeters available
    at present and have significant influence on the realization of a gravity reference
    through international comparisons of absolute gravimeters. The latter comparisons
    are the only way to maintain the traceability of absolute gravimetry to the International
    System of Units (SI). Sources of systematic error such as the self-attraction
    effect (SAE) have to be taken into account when determining accurate values of
    the acceleration due to gravity, as needed, for example, for the watt balance
    project or the International Gravity Reference System. In this paper the SAE for
    two types of FG5 gravimeter is estimated using two independent methods. The resulting
    SAEs are 1.2(0.2) µGal and 1.7(0.2) µGal for FG5 with fibre and bulk interferometer
    types, respectively. The importance of accurately defining the measurement height
    is emphasized in the context of the SAE. The accuracy and advantages of referring
    gravity measurements to an effective position of the free-fall solution are demonstrated
    together with a simple and accurate empirical estimation of this effective position.</p>
