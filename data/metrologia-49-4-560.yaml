abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The perturbations of the gravitational field due to the mass
    distribution of an absolute gravimeter have been studied. The so-called self-attraction
    effect (SAE) is crucial for the measurement accuracy, especially for International
    Comparisons, and for the uncertainty budget evaluation. Three instruments have
    been analysed: MPG-2, FG5-238 and IMGC-02. The SAE has been calculated using a
    numerical method based on finite element method simulation. The modelled effect
    has been treated as an additional vertical gravity gradient. The self-attraction
    correction (SAC) to be applied to the computed g value is of the order of 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>.</p>'
