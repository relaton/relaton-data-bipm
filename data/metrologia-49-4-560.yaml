    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The perturbations of the gravitational field due to the mass distribution of an absolute gravimeter have been studied. The so-called self-attraction effect (SAE) is crucial for the measurement accuracy, especially for International Comparisons, and for the uncertainty budget evaluation. Three instruments have been analysed: MPG-2, FG5-238 and IMGC-02. The SAE has been calculated using a numerical method based on finite element method simulation. The modelled effect has been treated as an additional vertical gravity gradient. The self-attraction correction (SAC) to be applied to the computed <italic>g</italic> value is of the order of 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>.</p>
