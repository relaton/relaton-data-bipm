abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We compare different methods for the adjustment of the Planck
    constant using recent, inconsistent data. First we discuss the popular Birge ratio
    method. By stating the underlying statistical model we critically assess and modify
    this method. We then propose alternative ways of adjusting the inconsistent data
    using different, less restrictive assumptions about the cause of the inconsistency.
    Finally, we discuss the results and give some guidance as to the choice of method.</p>
