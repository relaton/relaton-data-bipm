abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A Monte Carlo method is developed for computing the angle factors
    of diffuse cavities. It was confirmed that the Monte Carlo method for calculating
    angle factors is powerful and flexible due to its applicability to arbitrarily
    shaped cavities whose internal surfaces are diffuse. The algorithms of angle factors
    for regular shapes of cavities were first proposed. Then the calculations of angle
    factors for cavities with grooved cylinders were performed, and the reproducibility
    and correctness of the results obtained by the Monte Carlo method were estimated.
    In short, the Monte Carlo algorithms are certainly simple and accurate for those
    intricately shaped cavities compared with the mathematical calculation used before.</p>
