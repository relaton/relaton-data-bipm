    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A Monte Carlo method is developed for computing the angle factors of diffuse cavities. It was confirmed that the Monte Carlo method for calculating angle factors is powerful and flexible due to its applicability to arbitrarily shaped cavities whose internal surfaces are diffuse. The algorithms of angle factors for regular shapes of cavities were first proposed. Then the calculations of angle factors for cavities with grooved cylinders were performed, and the reproducibility and correctness of the results obtained by the Monte Carlo method were estimated. In short, the Monte Carlo algorithms are certainly simple and accurate for those intricately shaped cavities compared with the mathematical calculation used before.</p>
