abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have evaluated the responsivity of seven different thermal
    detectors compared to an electrically calibrated photoacoustic reference detector
    at 119 µm (2.5 THz) and 394 µm (0.76 THz) laser wavelengths. Among the thermal
    detectors is an electrically calibrated thermopile having a vertically aligned
    carbon nanotube array as the absorber. We document the uncertainty contributions
    attributable to the photoacoustic reference detector along with a definition of
    a calibration factor based on the measurement protocol. The expanded relative
    uncertainty (k = 2) and a calibration factor of each detector are tabulated.</p>
