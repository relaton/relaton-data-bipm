abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The impact of combining two covariance matrix reduction methods
    on the resulting Kalman filter timescale estimates and covariances is addressed.
    The Brown and Greenhall reduction operations commute, and the combination of both
    reductions gives the same Kalman filter estimates as the Greenhall reduction alone.
    The benefit of combining both methods is that the Greenhall reduced covariances
    are further reduced in the positive semi-definite sense. A numerical example demonstrates
    the combined reduction by calculating the trace of the original and reduced covariance
    matrices. It is pointed out that the corrected clock offsets can follow the system
    time offset with different precisions, but the mutual disagreements of the corrected
    time offsets (called synchronization error) can be identical.</p>
