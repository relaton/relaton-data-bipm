abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This letter examines the structure of draft definitions of the
    New SI base units, which are posted on the BIPM website. It is argued that the
    new definitions of base units should be free from references to derived units
    and should not comprise conditional phrases; names of base units should be clearly
    distinguished from their symbols. To alleviate the identified problems, relevant
    modifications of the draft definitions are proposed.</p>
