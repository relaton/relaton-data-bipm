    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This letter examines the structure of draft definitions of the New SI base units, which are posted on the BIPM website. It is argued that the new definitions of base units should be free from references to derived units and should not comprise conditional phrases; names of base units should be clearly distinguished from their symbols. To alleviate the identified problems, relevant modifications of the draft definitions are proposed.</p>
