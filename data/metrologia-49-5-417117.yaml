abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The devices and methods applied for the LNE–LNHB primary standards
    in terms of reference air-kerma and absorbed dose to water for low dose-rate brachytherapy
    sources are described. Both standards are based on ionometric measurements, using
    a circular-shaped free-in-air ionization chamber, and Monte Carlo calculated conversion
    factors. Results for an IBt Bebig<sup>125</sup>I source are presented and used
    here to assess the dose-rate constant. Uncertainties of 1.5% and 1.6% (with k = 1)
    were found for the air-kerma rate and the absorbed dose to water rate estimated
    with the new primary standards. Good agreement was found between our values and
    the AAPM published dose-rate constants. Comparisons with other primary standards
    are in progress.</p>
