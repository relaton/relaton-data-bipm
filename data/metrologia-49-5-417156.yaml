abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The spatial and temporal distribution of the temperature elevation
    caused by high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) in a tissue-mimicking material
    (TMM) has been determined with magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry, infrared (IR)
    thermometry and a thermal test object with an integrated thin-film thermocouple
    at three different National Metrological Institutes (PTB/Germany, NPL/UK, INRIM/Italy).
    Results obtained from the different types of measurement are compared and some
    general aspects of the methods are discussed, particularly with regard to their
    suitability for the in vitro characterization of transducers for treatment planning.</p>
