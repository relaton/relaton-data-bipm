abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>International and national reports strongly recommend experimental
    verification of the calibration of new HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir sources prior to their
    clinical application for afterloading brachytherapy. To guarantee traceability,
    calibrated transfer standards are used, e.g. the recommended well-type ionization
    chambers (WIC) or certain detector–phantom arrangements (DPA) consisting of a
    thimble-type ionization chamber with a solid phantom. In Germany, direct calibrations
    for<sup>192</sup>Ir were only provided for WICs. In June 2010, the PTB directly
    calibrated a DPA-transfer standard in the quantity reference air-kerma rate (RAKR)
    for<sup>192</sup>Ir photons for the University Hospital Tübingen. This direct
    calibration provides the advantage that the comprehensive RAKR<sup>192</sup>Ir
    calibration coefficient already takes all influence quantities into account—their
    correction factors are thus unified—except for the air-density correction k<sub>ρ</sub>.
    The DPA-transfer standard described above and a WIC used as a reference were compared
    for acceptance tests of three GammaMedplus HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir afterloading sources.
    The measurement uncertainty of the WIC and of the DPA-transfer standard were ±2.6%(k = 2)
    and ±2.8%(k = 2) respectively. A strong correlation was found between these measurement
    results with a coefficient of determination of r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9998.</p><p>Determining
    the RAKR of an HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir afterloading source is as simple with the DPA
    as it is with WIC. The direct<sup>192</sup>Ir calibrated DPA-transfer standard
    can therefore be used alternatively in future with the same measurement uncertainty
    if no WIC is available.</p>
