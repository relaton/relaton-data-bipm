abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Low-intensity radioactive sources emitting low-energy photons
    are used in the clinic for low dose-rate brachytherapy treatments of tumours.
    The dosimetry of these sources is based on reference air kerma rate measurements.
    The absorbed dose rate to water at the reference depth  d<sub>0</sub> = 1 cm,,
    is then obtained by a conversion procedure with a large relative standard uncertainty
    of about 5%. This paper describes a primary standard developed at ENEA-INMRI to
    directly measure \n \n   \n  \n  due to LDR sources. The standard is based on
    a large-angle and variable-volume ionization chamber, embedded in a graphite phantom
    and operating under ‘wall-less air chamber’ conditions. A set of correction and
    conversion factors, based on experiments and Monte Carlo simulations, are determined
    to obtain the value of  D<sub>w,1 cm</sub> from measurements of increment of ionization
    current with increasing chamber volume. The relative standard uncertainty on \n
    \n   \n  \n  is 2.6%, which is appreciably lower than the current uncertainty.
    Characteristics of the standard, its associated uncertainty budget, and some experimental
    results are given for<sup>125</sup>I BEBIG I25.S16.C brachytherapy seeds. Finally,
    results of the experimental determination of the dose-rate constant Λ<sub>1 cm</sub>,
    traceable to the  D<sub>w,1 cm</sub> and the low-energy air kerma ENEA-INMRI standards,
    are given. The relative standard uncertainty on Λ<sub>1 cm</sub> is 2.9%, appreciably
    lower than the typical uncertainty (4.8%) of the values available in the literature.</p>"
