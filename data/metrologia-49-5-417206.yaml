abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>IBA Dosimetry GmbH participated in the Joint Research Project
    ‘Increasing cancer treatment efficacy using 3D brachytherapy’ as a non-funded
    partner in the work package which was mostly dedicated to the determination of
    dose-to-water distribution from a high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy source.</p><p>The
    dose distribution was measured with a MatriXX (MXX) 2D detector array and compared
    with Dose Cube Data, calculated by treatment planning systems (TPS). All measurements
    and calculations were performed in cooperation with OUSA, Bratislava and FNB,
    Prague. The comparison has been carried out for three irradiation geometries:
    single source position, single line and four line motions of the source, and with
    the effective point of measurement in a plane at 6 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm distance
    from the source position.</p><p>The comparison of the MXX measurements and the
    TPS calculations was evaluated by the commercial IBA Dosimetry software OmniPro
    I''mRT (1) as the difference between maximum of measured and calculated values
    and (2) as the maximum difference between the two-dimensional distributions of
    measured and calculated values. The dose distribution was evaluated by the gamma
    method with parameters 3 mm and 3%.</p><p>All differences of comparison of the
    MXX measurements and TPS calculations were within the range ±10% and the γ-index
    was less than 1 for 96% (or 97%, respectively) of the dose distribution in the
    plane at 10 mm distance from the source position.</p>'
