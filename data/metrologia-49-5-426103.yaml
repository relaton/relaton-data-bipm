abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In 2008, within the framework of the European Metrology Research
    Programme (EMRP), two projects were launched with the central objective of providing
    reliable measuring techniques for the methods of modern cancer therapy using ionizing
    radiation—such as brachytherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy and hadron
    therapy—and using high intensity therapeutic ultrasound. The two three-year projects
    are ‘Increasing cancer treatment efficacy using 3D brachytherapy’ (Brachytherapy)
    and ‘External Beam Cancer Therapy’ (EBCT). For these modern treatment methods
    there is an urgent requirement for establishing a sound metrological basis with
    regard to the radiation dose delivered and its spatial distribution. This paper
    gives a brief overview about the two projects' work, their goals and findings.
    The details of the projects' work and their outcomes are presented within these
    conference proceedings or in the cited publications.</p>
