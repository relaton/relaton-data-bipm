    <p>Although physical treatments play a central role in cancer therapy, SI-traceable metrology has only been established for some of them. Several forms of treatment currently used (particularly intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), hadron therapy, high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) and brachytherapy) suffer from the limited metrological support, which restricts the success of these techniques.</p>
    <p>Recognizing this deficit, the European Union identified metrology for health as one of the first four Targeted Programmes in the framework of the European Metrology Research Programme (EMRP) running from 2008 to 2011. This programme included two EMRP projects addressing metrology for cancer therapy:
     <list list-type="unordered">
     <list-item><p>project T2.J06 dealing with brachytherapy</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>project T2.J07 dealing with external beam cancer therapy using ionizing radiation and high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound.</p></list-item>
    </list>
    Primary measurement standards applicable to modern treatment conditions were developed under both projects, together with measurement techniques which are meant as a basis for future protocols for dosimetry, treatment planning and monitoring.</p>
    <p>In order to provide a platform for the presentation of current developments in clinical measurement techniques for cancer therapy, together with the achievements of both projects, an international Conference on Advanced Metrology for Cancer Therapy (CAMCT) was held from 29 November to 1 December 2011 at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig, Germany. The main sessions of the conference:
     <list list-type="unordered">
     <list-item><p>Primary and secondary standards of absorbed dose to water for IMRT and brachytherapy,</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>3D dose distributions and treatment planning for IMRT and brachytherapy,</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>Hadron therapy (protons and carbon ions),</p></list-item>
     <list-item><p>High-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU),</p></list-item>
    </list>
    were geared to the main foci of the projects.</p>
    <p>Metrologists and medical physicists from countries all over the world attended the conference and made it into a forum for the exchange of information and expertise.</p>
    <p>The papers in this special issue describe in detail the achievements and new methods presented at the CAMCT conference.</p>
