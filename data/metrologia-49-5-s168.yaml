abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A new calorimeter for dosimetry in small and complex fields
    has been built. The device is intended for the direct determination of absorbed
    dose to water in moderately small fields and in composite fields such as IMRT
    treatments, and as a transfer instrument calibrated against existing absorbed
    dose standards in conventional reference conditions. The geometry, materials and
    mode of operation have been chosen to minimize detector perturbations when used
    in a water phantom, to give a reasonably isotropic response and to minimize the
    effects of heat transfer when the calorimeter is used in non-reference conditions
    in a water phantom. The size of the core is meant to meet the needs of measurement
    in IMRT treatments and is comparable to the size of the air cavity in a type NE2611
    ionization chamber. The calorimeter may also be used for small field dosimetry.</p><p>Initial
    measurements in reference conditions and in an IMRT head and neck plan, collapsed
    to gantry angle zero, have been made to estimate the thermal characteristics of
    the device, and to assess its performance in use. The standard deviation (estimated
    repeatability) of the reference absorbed dose measurements was 0.02Â Gy (0.6%).</p>
