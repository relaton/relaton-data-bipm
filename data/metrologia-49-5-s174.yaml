abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Within the Euramet JRP7 project External Beam Cancer Therapy,
    a work package was dedicated to the primary standards for IMRT (intensity modulated
    radiation therapy). The French national metrology laboratory for ionizing radiations,
    LNE-LNHB, was involved in determining absorbed dose to water based on graphite
    calorimeters in 6 MV and 12 MV beams for field sizes of 10 cm × 10 cm, 4 cm × 4 cm
    and 2 cm × 2 cm.</p><p>The existing GR-09 graphite calorimeter has been successfully
    used for the beam sizes of 10 cm × 10 cm and 4 cm × 4 cm whereas it was not small
    enough to perform measurements in the 2 cm × 2 cm beam size. Therefore, during
    the project a small section graphite calorimeter, GR-10, has been developed.</p><p>This
    work deals with the design, construction and tests of this new graphite calorimeter.</p>
