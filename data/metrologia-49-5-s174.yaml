    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Within the Euramet JRP7 project External Beam Cancer Therapy, a work package was dedicated to the primary standards for IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy). The French national metrology laboratory for ionizing radiations, LNE-LNHB, was involved in determining absorbed dose to water based on graphite calorimeters in 6 MV and 12 MV beams for field sizes of 10 cm × 10 cm, 4 cm × 4 cm and 2 cm × 2 cm.</p>
    <p>The existing GR-09 graphite calorimeter has been successfully used for the beam sizes of 10 cm × 10 cm and 4 cm × 4 cm whereas it was not small enough to perform measurements in the 2 cm × 2 cm beam size. Therefore, during the project a small section graphite calorimeter, GR-10, has been developed.</p>
    <p>This work deals with the design, construction and tests of this new graphite calorimeter.</p>
