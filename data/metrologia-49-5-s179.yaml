abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Within the framework of the JRP06 European project ‘Increasing
    Cancer Treatment Efficacy Using 3D Brachytherapy’, a prototype of a graphite standard
    calorimeter for the measurement of the absorbed dose rate to water,, for<sup>192</sup>Ir
    sources used in high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy has been developed at the Italian
    National Institute of Ionizing Radiation Metrology (ENEA-INMRI). The calorimeter
    was tested at the Sant'Andrea Hospital in Rome, where \n\n\n\n measurements were
    performed in the quasi-adiabatic mode of operation using an<sup>192</sup>Ir MicroSelectron®
    HDR V2 source. The \n\n\n\n measurements showed a reproducibility of about 1%,
    while the combined standard uncertainty on the \n\n\n\n value at the distance
    of 1 cm from the source was estimated as 1.4%, lower than the uncertainty of \n\n\n\n
    determined from the reference air-kerma rate.</p>"
