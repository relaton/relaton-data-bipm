abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>A novel graphite calorimeter for absorbed dose rate measurements
    close to high dose rate (HDR)<sup>192</sup>Ir brachytherapy sources has been designed
    and built at the UK National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The graphite calorimeter
    allows a more direct calibration of HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir sources in terms of absorbed
    dose rate to water at a distance of 1 cm,, compared with the current air kerma-based
    calibration method, where \n\n\n\n is determined as the product of the measured
    air kerma strength and the dose rate constant, Λ, resulting in overall standard
    uncertainties of up to 5%. With the new absorbed dose standard, \n\n\n\n can be
    measured directly with standard uncertainties between 0.7% and 1.0%, depending
    on the operating mode of the calorimeter. A Nucletron microSelectron-v1 Classic
    HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir source was calibrated with the calorimeter in terms of. The
    same source was also calibrated with NPL's HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir air kerma primary
    standard in terms of reference air kerma rate. Combining both measurements yielded
    the experimentally determined dose rate constant of the<sup>192</sup>Ir source.</p>"
