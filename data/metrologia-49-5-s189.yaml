    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The devices and methods applied for the LNE–LNHB primary standards in terms of reference air-kerma and absorbed dose to water for low dose-rate brachytherapy sources are described. Both standards are based on ionometric measurements, using a circular-shaped free-in-air ionization chamber, and Monte Carlo calculated conversion factors. Results for an IBt Bebig <sup>125</sup>I source are presented and used here to assess the dose-rate constant. Uncertainties of 1.5% and 1.6% (with <italic>k</italic> = 1) were found for the air-kerma rate and the absorbed dose to water rate estimated with the new primary standards. Good agreement was found between our values and the AAPM published dose-rate constants. Comparisons with other primary standards are in progress.</p>
