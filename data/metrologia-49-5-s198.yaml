    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The German national metrology institute (PTB) developed a primary standard in terms of absorbed-dose to water <italic>D</italic><sub>w</sub> for low-energy interstitial brachytherapy sources, which is based on an extrapolation chamber in a phantom of water-equivalent material.</p>
    <p>The method to determine <italic>D</italic><sub>w</sub> from extrapolation chamber measurements has been newly developed and is already described in the literature. With the chamber the absorbed-dose at 30 cm distance from the source is measured and the quantity is converted into the desired quantity, the absorbed-dose to water measured at 1 cm distance perpendicular to the source axis.</p>
    <p>In this paper, a synthesis of the work done within the EMRP Project: ‘TP2.JRP6: Increasing Cancer Treatment Efficacy Using 3D Brachytherapy’ is given and the final results and the final uncertainty budget are presented. Furthermore, an experimentally determined dose-rate constant for this seed type (BEBIG Symmetra I25.S16) is given based on the measurement of four different instances.</p>
