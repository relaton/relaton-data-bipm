abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The German national metrology institute (PTB) developed a primary
    standard in terms of absorbed-dose to water D<sub>w</sub> for low-energy interstitial
    brachytherapy sources, which is based on an extrapolation chamber in a phantom
    of water-equivalent material.</p><p>The method to determine D<sub>w</sub> from
    extrapolation chamber measurements has been newly developed and is already described
    in the literature. With the chamber the absorbed-dose at 30 cm distance from the
    source is measured and the quantity is converted into the desired quantity, the
    absorbed-dose to water measured at 1 cm distance perpendicular to the source axis.</p><p>In
    this paper, a synthesis of the work done within the EMRP Project: ‘TP2.JRP6: Increasing
    Cancer Treatment Efficacy Using 3D Brachytherapy’ is given and the final results
    and the final uncertainty budget are presented. Furthermore, an experimentally
    determined dose-rate constant for this seed type (BEBIG Symmetra I25.S16) is given
    based on the measurement of four different instances.</p>'
