abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>During the Euramet project JRP7 ‘External Beam Cancer Therapy’,
    PTB and LNE–LNHB used primary standards to determine the absorbed dose to water
    under IMRT conditions (in small fields). PTB used a water calorimeter to determine
    the absorbed-dose-to-water references in 6 MV and 10 MV beams for field sizes
    of 10 cm × 10 cm and 3 cm × 3 cm while LNE–LNHB used graphite calorimeters in
    6 MV and 12 MV beams for field sizes of 10 cm × 10 cm, 4 cm × 4 cm and 2 cm × 2 cm.
    The purpose of this study is to compare PTB and LNE–LNHB new absorbed-dose-to-water
    references.</p><p>LNE–LNHB sent an Exradin A1SL ionization chamber traceable to
    its primary standard to the PTB for calibration in<sup>60</sup>Co and in linac
    beams and PTB sent a PTW 31010 ionization chamber traceable to its primary standard
    to LNE–LNHB for calibration in<sup>60</sup>Co and in linac beams. Calculated S<sub>w,air</sub>
    will be used as beam quality specifier for the ionization chamber comparison at
    different field sizes.</p><p>The standard uncertainties (k = 1) of PTB and LNE–LNHB
    calibration coefficients lie respectively between 0.25% (<sup>60</sup>Co) and
    0.40% (linac) and between 0.29% and 0.46%.</p><p> PTB and LNE–LNHB absorbed-dose-to-water
    references developed for this project, based respectively on water calorimetry
    and on graphite calorimetry, agree within 1.5 standard deviations for field size
    of 10 cm × 10 cm down to 2 cm × 2 cm and for beams of 6 MV to 10 MV.</p>
