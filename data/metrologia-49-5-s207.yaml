abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A chemical vapour deposition diamond detector fabricated at
    Rome ‘Tor Vergata’ University was investigated for its applicability as transfer
    dosimeter in radiotherapy photon beams with small field sizes. The detector consists
    of a single crystal diamond with a very small sensitive volume (0.004 mm<sup>3</sup>).
    The detector showed a measurement repeatability of 0.1% and a long term reproducibility
    of 0.4%. Monte Carlo simulations revealed a response dependence on the photon
    beam energy of about 2% from the<sup>60</sup>Co quality to 10 MV photon beam.
    The calculated detector response was found to be independent of field size within
    0.5% from 10 cm × 10 cm to 2 cm × 2 cm beam size for both 6 MV and 10 MV photon
    beams, increasing in smaller field sizes. D<sub>w</sub> values obtained by the
    diamond detector were found to be in agreement with D<sub>w</sub> values obtained
    by a small volume ionization chamber in photon beams with field size down to 2 cm × 2 cm.</p>
