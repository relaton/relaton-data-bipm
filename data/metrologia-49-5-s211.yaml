abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For photon beam sizes lower than 2 cm × 2 cm no absorbed-dose-to-water
    (D<sub>w</sub>) primary standards are available for determining the possible influence
    of field size on the dosimeter response. In this work, D<sub>w</sub> measurements
    performed in 1 cm × 1 cm photon beams at PTB using alanine and synthetic diamond
    dosimeters were compared in order to assess the reliability of the two dosimetric
    systems in such a small field size. The ratio of D<sub>w</sub> values measured
    by diamond dosimeters to D<sub>w</sub> values measured by alanine was 0.991 ± 1.5%
    (1 SD) and 1.007 ± 1.3% (1 SD) for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams, respectively.
    This shows that both systems are capable of accurately measuring D<sub>w</sub>
    in small fields.</p>
