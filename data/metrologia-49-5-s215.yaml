abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The use of small photon fields in modern radiotherapy requires
    the determination of total scatter factors S<sub>cp</sub> or field factors Ω with
    high precision. Therefore, chamber-dependent correction factors for dose measurements
    in small fields are necessary. In this study Monte Carlo simulations were used
    to calculate the field factor Ω and chamber response-related correction factors
    for four different types of detectors in a clinical 6 MV photon beam for a square
    field size of 1 cm × 1 cm. As a beam source a Monte Carlo-based model of a Siemens
    KD linear accelerator was applied. The calculations aimed at the investigation
    of the influence of electron beam spot size on correction factors for small field
    dosimetry. The results confirm that accurate Monte Carlo calculations of the field
    factor Ω can only be carried out when the exact electron spot size is known. On
    the other hand no dependence of the electron beam spot size on the correction
    factors for the field size of 1 cm × 1 cm was observed.</p>
