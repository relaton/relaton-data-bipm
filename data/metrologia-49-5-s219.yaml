abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In 2008, the European project ‘T2.J06, Increasing cancer treatment
    efficacy using 3D brachytherapy’ was launched. One of the main goals of the Joint
    Research Project was the experimental determination of the dose rate constant
    Λ to allow the linkage between the air kerma strength or reference air kerma rate
    currently used for the source characterization and the ‘new’ absorbed dose rate
    to water with an uncertainty of &lt;3% (k = 1) for some selected brachytherapy
    sources. The results obtained by five National Metrology Institutes (NMI) for
    four different types of brachytherapy sources are presented and compared with
    consensus data published in the literature. A further goal of the project was
    to develop a calibration chain for the transfer of the new reference quantity
    to the end user, minimizing the uncertainty. A first direct calibration in terms
    of absorbed dose rate to water of a secondary standard and the dissemination to
    the hospitals is presented.</p>
