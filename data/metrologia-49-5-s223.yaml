abstract:
- content: Abstract<p><sup>125</sup>I brachytherapy sources have a complex geometry
    with very small dimensions. Those specificities induce problems of reproducibility
    in the manufacturing process. The consequence of this lack of reproducibility
    is a variation of the flux of the photonic emission from one seed to another.
    Consequently, it was observed that the spatial distribution of the absorbed dose
    to water is very dependent on the seed characteristics (geometry and components
    of the internal and wrapping materials). The purpose of this study was to quantify
    the sensitivity of the distribution of the absorbed dose to water due to the multi-element
    constitution and dimensional variations of the seeds.</p>
