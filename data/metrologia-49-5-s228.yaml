  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>The purpose of this work was to develop a
    procedure to directly estimate the spatial distribution of the absorbed dose rate
    to water, \n<inline-formula>\n<tex-math><?CDATA $\\dot {D}_{\\rm w}$ ></tex-math>\n<inline-graphic

    around an HDR <sup>192</sup>Ir brachytherapy source. The methodology developed
    was based on Monte Carlo calculations and measurements in air and in water with
    thermoluminescent detectors. Variations in detector positioning had a significant
    influence near the brachytherapy source (20% at 1 cm). The method leads to a mean
    difference of about 7% with the CLRP TG-43 Parameter Database when the absorbed
    dose to water is characterized along the transverse plane to the source (from
    1 cm to about 11 cm). This mean difference, however, is within an uncertainty
    of 7.7% over all distances. This method therefore can be used to provide direct
    estimates of the absorbed dose rate to water for HDR brachytherapy source irradiations
    which are more realistic than those which use other phantom materials. In addition,
    measurements are indicative of the source geometry and material composition.</p>\n"
