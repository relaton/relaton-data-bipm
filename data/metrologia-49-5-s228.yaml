abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The purpose of this work was to develop a procedure to directly
    estimate the spatial distribution of the absorbed dose rate to water,, around
    an HDR<sup>192</sup>Ir brachytherapy source. The methodology developed was based
    on Monte Carlo calculations and measurements in air and in water with thermoluminescent
    detectors. Variations in detector positioning had a significant influence near
    the brachytherapy source (20% at 1 cm). The method leads to a mean difference
    of about 7% with the CLRP TG-43 Parameter Database when the absorbed dose to water
    is characterized along the transverse plane to the source (from 1 cm to about
    11 cm). This mean difference, however, is within an uncertainty of 7.7% over all
    distances. This method therefore can be used to provide direct estimates of the
    absorbed dose rate to water for HDR brachytherapy source irradiations which are
    more realistic than those which use other phantom materials. In addition, measurements
    are indicative of the source geometry and material composition.</p>
