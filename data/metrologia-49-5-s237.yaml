    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>IBA Dosimetry GmbH participated in the Joint Research Project ‘Increasing cancer treatment efficacy using 3D brachytherapy’ as a non-funded partner in the work package which was mostly dedicated to the determination of dose-to-water distribution from a high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy source.</p>
    <p>The dose distribution was measured with a MatriXX (MXX) 2D detector array and compared with Dose Cube Data, calculated by treatment planning systems (TPS). All measurements and calculations were performed in cooperation with OUSA, Bratislava and FNB, Prague. The comparison has been carried out for three irradiation geometries: single source position, single line and four line motions of the source, and with the effective point of measurement in a plane at 6 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm distance from the source position.</p>
    <p>The comparison of the MXX measurements and the TPS calculations was evaluated by the commercial IBA Dosimetry software OmniPro I'm<italic>RT</italic> (1) as the difference between maximum of measured and calculated values and (2) as the maximum difference between the two-dimensional distributions of measured and calculated values. The dose distribution was evaluated by the gamma method with parameters 3 mm and 3%.</p>
    <p>All differences of comparison of the MXX measurements and TPS calculations were within the range ±10% and the <italic>γ</italic>-index was less than 1 for 96% (or 97%, respectively) of the dose distribution in the plane at 10 mm distance from the source position.</p>
