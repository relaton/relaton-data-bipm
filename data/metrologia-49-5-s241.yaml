    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>International and national reports strongly recommend experimental verification of the calibration of new HDR <sup>192</sup>Ir sources prior to their clinical application for afterloading brachytherapy. To guarantee traceability, calibrated transfer standards are used, e.g. the recommended well-type ionization chambers (WIC) or certain detector–phantom arrangements (DPA) consisting of a thimble-type ionization chamber with a solid phantom. In Germany, direct calibrations for <sup>192</sup>Ir were only provided for WICs. In June 2010, the PTB directly calibrated a DPA-transfer standard in the quantity reference air-kerma rate (RAKR) for <sup>192</sup>Ir photons for the University Hospital Tübingen. This direct calibration provides the advantage that the comprehensive RAKR <sup>192</sup>Ir calibration coefficient already takes all influence quantities into account—their correction factors are thus unified—except for the air-density correction <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>ρ</italic></sub>. The DPA-transfer standard described above and a WIC used as a reference were compared for acceptance tests of three GammaMed<italic>plus</italic> HDR <sup>192</sup>Ir afterloading sources. The measurement uncertainty of the WIC and of the DPA-transfer standard were ±2.6%(<italic>k</italic> = 2) and ±2.8%(<italic>k</italic> = 2) respectively. A strong correlation was found between these measurement results with a coefficient of determination of <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.9998.</p>
    <p>Determining the RAKR of an HDR <sup>192</sup>Ir afterloading source is as simple with the DPA as it is with WIC. The direct <sup>192</sup>Ir calibrated DPA-transfer standard can therefore be used alternatively in future with the same measurement uncertainty if no WIC is available.</p>
