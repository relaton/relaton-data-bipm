abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A secondary standard of the BEV, calibrated at the PTB in terms
    of D<sub>w,1 cm</sub>, was used for calibration of the well-type chamber-based
    measuring systems used in clinics. In addition to the calibration, we tried to
    employ it for assessment of treatment planning systems (TPS) used for each particular
    afterloader. The dose to water at 1 cm distance from the source position was calculated
    by the TPS, using reference data from the source producer certificate. The values
    were compared directly with the dose measured at the same distance from the source.</p><p>The
    comparison has been carried out for GammaMed Plus and MicroSelectron HDR sources.
    Differences of secondary standard measurements and TPS calculations were lower
    than ±5%, which is below the achievable uncertainty of both dose measurement and
    dose determination by the TPS. Nevertheless, it is higher than generally accepted
    in the case of external beam radiotherapy. Additional direct measurements in terms
    of D<sub>w,1 cm</sub> may improve the safety and reliability of patient treatment.</p>
