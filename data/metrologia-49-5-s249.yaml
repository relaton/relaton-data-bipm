abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Independent primary standards for brachytherapy photon-emitting
    source calibration in terms of dose-rate to water have been developed within the
    framework of the Euramet T2.J06 project. The introduction of dose-rate to water
    calibration presents an important change in clinical brachytherapy dosimetry that
    is expected to result to improved dosimetric accuracy. Nevertheless, as with any
    change in dosimetry for radiation therapy purposes, a phase-in period of well
    concerted actions aimed at precluding ambiguities and accidents at the end-user
    level is necessary. The overall uncertainty budget of clinical brachytherapy applications,
    as well as current trends in brachytherapy treatment planning system dose-calculation
    algorithms, also need to be considered for a realistic assessment of the net benefit
    of improving source calibration accuracy.</p>
