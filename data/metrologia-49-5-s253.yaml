abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In 2011, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine
    (AAPM) and the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie–European Society for Radiotherapy
    and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) published a report pertaining to uncertainties in brachytherapy
    single-source dosimetry preceding clinical use. The International Organization
    for Standardization's Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement and
    Technical Note 1297 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology are
    taken as reference standards for uncertainty formalism. Uncertainties involved
    in measurements or Monte Carlo methods to estimate brachytherapy dose distributions
    are provided with discussion of the components intrinsic to the overall dosimetric
    assessment. The uncertainty propagation from the primary calibration standard
    through transfer to the clinic for air-kerma strength is given with uncertainties
    in each of the brachytherapy dosimetry parameters of the AAPM TG-43 dose-calculation
    formalism. For low-energy and high-energy brachytherapy sources of low dose-rate
    and high dose-rate, a combined dosimetric uncertainty &lt;5% (k = 1) is estimated,
    which is consistent with prior literature estimates. Recommendations are provided
    for clinical medical physicists, dosimetry investigators, and manufacturers of
    brachytherapy sources and treatment planning systems. These recommendations reflect
    the guidance of the AAPM and GEC-ESTRO for their members, and may also be used
    as guidance to manufacturers and regulatory agencies in developing good manufacturing
    practices for conventional brachytherapy sources used in routine clinical treatments.</p>
