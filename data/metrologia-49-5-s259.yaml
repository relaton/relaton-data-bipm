abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>High-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) is an appealing
    non-invasive, non-ionizing therapeutic modality with a wide range of tissue interactions
    ranging from transient permeabilization of cell membranes to thermal ablation.
    The ability to guide and monitor the treatment with an associated ultrasonic or
    magnetic resonance imaging device has resulted in a dramatic rise in the clinical
    use of therapeutic ultrasound in the past two decades. Nevertheless, the range
    of clinical applications and the number of patients treated has grown at a much
    higher pace than the definition of standards. In this paper the metrological requirements
    of the therapeutic beams are reviewed and are compared with the current clinical
    use of image-guided HITU mostly based on a practical approach. Liver therapy,
    a particularly challenging clinical application, is discussed to highlight the
    differences between some complex clinical situations and the experimental conditions
    of the metrological characterization of ultrasonic transducers.</p>
