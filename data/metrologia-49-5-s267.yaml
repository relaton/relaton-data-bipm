    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Within the framework of a European project several techniques for measurements in high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) fields were improved in a collaboration of four national metrology institutes (NPL, UK; PTB, Germany; INRIM, Italy; UME, Turkey). This contribution focuses on measurement techniques for the characterization of HITU sources, in particular on measurements of the acoustic output power of HITU transducers and on the characterization of their pressure field.</p>
