abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Within the framework of a European project several techniques
    for measurements in high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) fields were improved
    in a collaboration of four national metrology institutes (NPL, UK; PTB, Germany;
    INRIM, Italy; UME, Turkey). This contribution focuses on measurement techniques
    for the characterization of HITU sources, in particular on measurements of the
    acoustic output power of HITU transducers and on the characterization of their
    pressure field.</p>
