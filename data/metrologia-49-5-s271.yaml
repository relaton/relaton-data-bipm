abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In this work, the new system for the power measurement of high
    intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducers realized at INRIM ultrasounds
    laboratory is described.</p><p>The system is based on a submersible load cell.
    This solution presents essentially two advantages: the first is that the target
    is linked directly to the force transducer sensing element, the second concerns
    the possibility to reduce the insonation time below 2 s or less.</p><p>Measurement
    results of conductance, G, made on two different HIFU transducers, are presented.
    The first one has a working frequency of 3.5 MHz and the second has a working
    frequency of 2.0 MHz. The power levels measured are in a range from 10 W to 100 W.
    Further measurements are made on a piston-like transducer with working frequency
    at 1.8611 MHz, for values of power from 5 W to 20 W.</p><p>The results of the
    ultrasonic conductance, G, obtained with the new system were compared with values
    obtained using the measuring system for low powers (P ⩽ 20 W).</p>'
