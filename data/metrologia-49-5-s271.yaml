    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this work, the new system for the power measurement of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducers realized at INRIM ultrasounds laboratory is described.</p>
    <p>The system is based on a submersible load cell. This solution presents essentially two advantages: the first is that the target is linked directly to the force transducer sensing element, the second concerns the possibility to reduce the insonation time below 2 s or less.</p>
    <p>Measurement results of conductance, <italic>G</italic>, made on two different HIFU transducers, are presented. The first one has a working frequency of 3.5 MHz and the second has a working frequency of 2.0 MHz. The power levels measured are in a range from 10 W to 100 W. Further measurements are made on a piston-like transducer with working frequency at 1.8611 MHz, for values of power from 5 W to 20 W.</p>
    <p>The results of the ultrasonic conductance, <italic>G</italic>, obtained with the new system were compared with values obtained using the measuring system for low powers (<italic>P</italic> ⩽ 20 W).</p>
