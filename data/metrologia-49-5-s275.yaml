abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The reliable description of the ultrasonic fields of high-intensity
    therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) devices is a prerequisite concerning the safe application
    of the method in the daily clinical routine. Since ultrasonic sensors used for
    the characterization of diagnostic fields are at high risk of being damaged in
    the strong therapeutic fields, the measurements are carried out in burst mode
    to reduce the acting temporal-average intensities. For the thorough investigation
    of possible differences between the excitation in continuous wave (cw) and burst
    mode, the temporal-average total acoustic output powers of two types of HITU transducers
    with f-numbers of approximately 1 and with working frequencies between 1.1 MHz
    and 3.3 MHz were investigated by means of a radiation force balance. The maximum
    cw equivalent power level was 300 W; the duty cycles varied between 1% and 90%.
    In addition, the possible effect of the transducer–target distance was investigated.
    It was found that the different turn-on and turn-off behaviour of the transducers
    caused variations of the effective duty cycle, depending on the power level and
    the power amplifier used. The temporal-average power declined with increasing
    distance as expected, and no focal anomaly was detected.</p>
