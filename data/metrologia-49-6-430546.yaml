abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In order to study the practical means of a dissemination of
    the redefined kilogram, the mass laboratory of METAS has built a new and unique
    instrument, which combines high precision mass measurement and element-specific
    surface chemical analysis by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under identical
    conditions. It is especially designed for the analysis of large samples such as
    real 1 kg standards and artefacts of up to 100 mm in diameter. In this paper,
    we first provide a detailed description of the apparatus. In a second step we
    demonstrate its performance by applying various processes, such as the transfer
    from ambient to vacuum, cleaning by low-pressure hydrogen plasma, transfer from
    vacuum to ambient and recontamination in air with time. Real 1 kg PtIr standards
    and surface artefacts have been monitored at individual steps gravimetrically,
    and in vacuum additionally by XPS. Values for the gain and loss of mass due to
    the application of different processes are provided. A model for the short-term
    recontamination after cleaning is presented, showing the initial growth of contaminants
    is self-limited.</p>
