abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents results obtained by conducting real-time
    linked common-view (CV) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) time transfer
    between stations that are supposed to maintain various GNSS system times including
    those of GPS and Galileo. The distance between those stations is typically more
    than 5000 km and the conventional CV GPS time transfer may not be feasible for
    such long-distance time transfer. We used the real-time linked CV time transfer
    technique to monitor the GNSS system time differences, and the time links examined
    in this study are the USNO–PTB link for the GPS–Galileo system time difference
    and the USNO–NICT link for the GPS–QZSS system time difference. The performance
    of the developed time transfer method was assessed by comparing against other
    time transfer solutions such as TWSTFT. Finally, global closure was formed to
    examine the inherent noise level of the method in a self-sufficient way. Results
    showed that the real-time linked CV time transfer solution yields sub-nanosecond-level
    agreement with the reference solutions including TWSTFT, and its frequency stability
    is generally at the level of (3–4) × 10<sup>−15</sup> in terms of the modified
    Allan deviation at the averaging time of one day, which seems to be sufficient
    to support civil interoperability between different GNSSs for sub-metre-level
    accuracy.</p>
