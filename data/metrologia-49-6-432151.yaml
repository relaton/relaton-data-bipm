abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The recontamination and long-term stability of materials suitable
    for mass standards was studied with x-ray photoemission spectroscopy after low-pressure
    plasma cleaning using hydrogen and oxygen. The cleaned samples were stored in
    air or argon at ambient pressure and under UHV conditions and the surface chemical
    state was monitored continuously. We found the recontamination exhibits initially
    self-limited growth. In the long term over three years, we found no indication
    for further accumulation of contaminants. From the uncertainties of our observations
    we provide an upper limit for the long-term contamination which is the lowest
    of all the results published up to now. The stability of PtIr and Au upon different
    cleaning processes and storage conditions is described in detail.</p>
