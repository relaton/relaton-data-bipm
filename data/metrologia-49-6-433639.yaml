abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Coaxial air lines are used as primary standards of characteristic
    impedance at microwave and millimetre-wave frequencies. A key property of these
    lines that needs to be known in order to define the characteristic impedance is
    the resistivity of the conductors of the line at these high frequencies. This
    paper presents a simple, reliable method for determining the high-frequency resistivity,
    and subsequently the characteristic impedance, of air lines. The method is based
    on measuring the S-parameters of the line. The method is supported by a detailed
    uncertainty analysis, and is also verified using a second method which uses measured
    values for the line's propagation constant. Throughout the paper, measurements
    of a typical air line are used to illustrate both methods.</p>
