abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We demonstrate the capability of accurate time transfer using
    optical fibres over long distances utilizing a dark fibre and hardware which is
    usually employed in two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT). Our
    time transfer through optical fibre (TTTOF) system is a variant of the standard
    TWSTFT by employing an optical fibre in the transmission path instead of free-space
    transmission of signals between two ground stations through geostationary satellites.
    As we use a dark fibre there are practically no limitations to the bandwidth of
    the transmitted signals so that we can use the highest chip rate of the binary
    phase-shift modulation available from the commercial equipment. This leads to
    an enhanced precision compared with satellite time transfer where the occupied
    bandwidth is limited for cost reasons. The TTTOF system has been characterized
    and calibrated in a common-clock experiment at PTB, and the combined calibration
    uncertainty is estimated as 74 ps. In a second step the remote part of the system
    was operated at Leibniz Universität Hannover, Institut für Quantenoptik (IQ) separated
    by 73 km from PTB in Braunschweig. In parallel, a GPS time transfer link between
    Braunschweig and Hannover was established, and both links connected a passive
    hydrogen maser at IQ with the reference time scale UTC(PTB) maintained in PTB.
    The results obtained with both links agree within the 1- σ  uncertainty of the
    GPS link results, which is estimated as 0.72 ns. The fibre link exhibits a nearly
    ten-fold improved stability compared with the GPS link, and assessment of its
    performance has been limited by the properties of the passive maser.</p>
