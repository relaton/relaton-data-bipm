abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The new cleaning techniques of low-pressure hydrogen plasma
    and UV/ozone were directly compared with the established nettoyage-lavage procedure
    using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on PtIr and Au-alloy samples. The
    different cleaning techniques have been validated with respect to the achieved
    cleanliness, the remaining contaminants and the speed of action. The new techniques
    were found to be more efficient for the removal of hydrocarbons, delivered reproducible
    results and the final surface chemical state was achieved repeatedly. For hydrogen
    plasma we found the speed of action is four times faster than for the UV/ozone
    cleaning and results in slightly smaller amounts of remaining hydrocarbons. Hydrogen
    plasma also removed oxygen compounds whereas UV/ozone led to oxidized surfaces.
    Further cyclic measurements with hydrogen plasma and UV/ozone revealed a fast
    reduction of oxides upon plasma treatment and a re-oxidation when subsequently
    treated with UV/ozone.</p>
