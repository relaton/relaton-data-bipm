abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The concept of a programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS)
    was first proposed in 1997. Since then a significant amount of research and development
    work has been devoted to the fabrication of the programmable Josephson junction
    array and its deployment in a voltage standard system. This paper reports the
    recent development of a 10 V PJVS system at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) and its voltage metrology applications. The superior stability
    of the voltage step of the new 10 V PJVS enables it to perform the same tasks
    as the conventional Josephson voltage standard (JVS) that uses hysteretic voltage
    steps and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a JVS direct comparison.
    For the first time, a comparison between a conventional JVS and the NIST 10 V
    PJVS was performed in order to verify the performance of the NIST 10 V PJVS. The
    mean difference between the two systems at 10 V was found to be −0.49 nV with
    a combined standard uncertainty of 1.32 nV (k = 1) or a relative combined standard
    uncertainty of 1.32 parts in 10<sup>10</sup>. Automatic comparisons between the
    10 V PJVS and a 2.5 V PJVS at 1.018 V were performed to monitor the long term
    accuracy and stability of the 2.5 V PJVS and to support the NIST electronic kilogram
    experiment. By matching the voltages of the two PJVS systems during a comparison,
    the type B uncertainty can be minimized to a negligible level. The difference
    between the two PJVS at 1.018 V was found to be −0.38 nV with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 0.68 nV (k = 1) or a relative combined standard uncertainty of
    6.7 parts in 10<sup>10</sup>. Issues encountered during the PJVS comparison and
    potential challenges for 10 V applications are also discussed.</p>
