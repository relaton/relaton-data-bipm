- content: 'Abstract<p>The 8th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters (ICAG2009)
    took place at the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
    (BIPM) from September to October 2009. It was the first ICAG organized as a key
    comparison in the framework of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the
    International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM MRA) (CIPM 1999). ICAG2009
    was composed of a Key Comparison (KC) as defined by the CIPM MRA, organized by
    the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) and designated
    as CCM.G-K1. Participating gravimeters and their operators came from national
    metrology institutes (NMIs) or their designated institutes (DIs) as defined by
    the CIPM MRA. A Pilot Study (PS) was run in parallel in order to include gravimeters
    and their operators from other institutes which, while not signatories of the
    CIPM MRA, nevertheless play important roles in international gravimetry measurements.
    The aim of the CIPM MRA is to have international acceptance of the measurement
    capabilities of the participating institutes in various fields of metrology. The
    results of CCM.G-K1 thus constitute an accurate and consistent gravity reference
    traceable to the SI (International System of Units), which can be used as the
    global basis for geodetic, geophysical and metrological observations of gravity.
    The measurements performed afterwards by the KC participants can be referred to
    the international metrological reference, i.e. they are SI-traceable.</p><p>The
    ICAG2009 was complemented by a number of associated measurements: the Relative
    Gravity Campaign (RGC2009), high-precision levelling and an accurate gravity survey
    in support of the BIPM watt balance project. The major measurements took place
    at the BIPM between July and October 2009. Altogether 24 institutes with 22 absolute
    gravimeters (one of the 22 AGs was ultimately withdrawn) and nine relative gravimeters
    participated in the ICAG/RGC campaign.</p><p>This paper is focused on the absolute
    gravity campaign. We review the history of the ICAGs and present the organization,
    data processing and the final results of the ICAG2009.</p><p>After almost thirty
    years of hosting eight successive ICAGs, the CIPM decided to transfer the responsibility
    for piloting the future ICAGs to NMIs, although maintaining a supervisory role
    through its Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities.</p>'
