    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Impurity measurements of the <sup>28</sup>Si crystal used for the determination of the Avogadro constant are essential to prevent biased results or underestimated uncertainties. A review of the existing data confirmed the high purity of silicon with respect to a large number of elements. In order to obtain direct evidence of purity, we developed a relative analytical method based on neutron activation. As a preliminary test, this method was applied to a sample of the Avogadro natural silicon crystal WASO 04. The investigation concerned 29 elements. The mass fraction of Au was quantified to be (1.03 ± 0.18) × 10<sup>−12</sup>. For the remaining 28 elements, the mass fractions were below the detection limits, which ranged between 1 × 10<sup>−12</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>.</p>
