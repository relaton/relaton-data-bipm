abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Impurity measurements of the<sup>28</sup>Si crystal used for
    the determination of the Avogadro constant are essential to prevent biased results
    or underestimated uncertainties. A review of the existing data confirmed the high
    purity of silicon with respect to a large number of elements. In order to obtain
    direct evidence of purity, we developed a relative analytical method based on
    neutron activation. As a preliminary test, this method was applied to a sample
    of the Avogadro natural silicon crystal WASO 04. The investigation concerned 29
    elements. The mass fraction of Au was quantified to be (1.03 ± 0.18) × 10<sup>−12</sup>.
    For the remaining 28 elements, the mass fractions were below the detection limits,
    which ranged between 1 × 10<sup>−12</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup>.</p>
