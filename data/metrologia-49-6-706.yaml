abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An absolute gravimeter is analysed as a linear time-invariant
    system in the frequency domain. Frequency responses of absolute gravimeters are
    derived analytically based on the propagation of the complex exponential signal
    through their linear measurement functions. Depending on the model of motion and
    the number of timeâ€“distance coordinates, an absolute gravimeter is considered
    as a second-order (three-level scheme) or third-order (multiple-level scheme)
    low-pass filter. It is shown that the behaviour of an atom absolute gravimeter
    in the frequency domain corresponds to that of the three-level corner-cube absolute
    gravimeter. Theoretical results are applied for evaluation of random and systematic
    measurement errors and optimization of an experiment. The developed theory agrees
    with known results of an absolute gravimeter analysis in the time and frequency
    domains and can be used for measurement uncertainty analyses, building of vibration-isolation
    systems and synthesis of digital filtering algorithms.</p>
