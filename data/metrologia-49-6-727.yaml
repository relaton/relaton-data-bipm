    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The uncertainty of the photometer directional response index <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations and error models derived for the characterization measurements of three photometers. Both random and biased types of errors are used simultaneously to model the measurement noise, drift of the light source, alignment of the photometer, and the errors of the rotary stage. The values of <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> obtained for each azimuth angle of the photometer are sensitive to the asymmetry of the directional response. It is shown by variation of the photometer symmetry that the changes in the value of <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> calculated as an average of all simulated values are small. It is further demonstrated that with typical measurement distances the quality index <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> can be sensitive to the position of the axis of rotation with respect to the receiving plane of the photometer. The simulated <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> values of the three photometers with expanded uncertainties (<italic>k</italic> = 2) are (4.325 ± 0.035)%, (1.698 ± 0.027)% and (4.315 ± 0.030)%.</p>
