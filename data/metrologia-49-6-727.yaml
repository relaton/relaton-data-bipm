abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The uncertainty of the photometer directional response index
    f<sub>2</sub> is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations and error models derived
    for the characterization measurements of three photometers. Both random and biased
    types of errors are used simultaneously to model the measurement noise, drift
    of the light source, alignment of the photometer, and the errors of the rotary
    stage. The values of f<sub>2</sub> obtained for each azimuth angle of the photometer
    are sensitive to the asymmetry of the directional response. It is shown by variation
    of the photometer symmetry that the changes in the value of f<sub>2</sub> calculated
    as an average of all simulated values are small. It is further demonstrated that
    with typical measurement distances the quality index f<sub>2</sub> can be sensitive
    to the position of the axis of rotation with respect to the receiving plane of
    the photometer. The simulated f<sub>2</sub> values of the three photometers with
    expanded uncertainties (k = 2) are (4.325 ± 0.035)%, (1.698 ± 0.027)% and (4.315 ± 0.030)%.</p>
