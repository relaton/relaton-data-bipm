abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have developed a technique for measuring the broadband optical
    emissivity of high reflectivity samples at cryogenic temperatures. This measurement
    method employs a primary standard optical detector with high absorptance from
    visible wavelengths to beyond 200 µm. Background subtraction and quantification
    allow determination of the emissivity with total absolute uncertainty (k = 1)
    between approximately 0.0002 and 0.002 (for emissivities between 0.0035 and 0.092)
    over the temperature range from 80 K to 300 K. Using the irradiance data at the
    detector, precise measurements of the experimental geometry and diffraction calculations,
    the optical power emitted by the sample can be determined. Contact thermometry
    measurements for the sample can then be used to find its emissivity. The emissivity
    calibration technique is demonstrated for large plate samples made from polished
    stainless steel and is also extended to calculate the separate emissivities of
    multiple distinct regions on a more complex sample assembly.</p>
