abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recent efforts (including effective ex-post stray light corrections)
    have allowed significant improvement in the performance (tested by intercomparison)
    of low-cost array spectroradiometers. However, the problem of uncertainty evaluation
    of UV measurements by these instruments has not been comprehensibly addressed
    mainly because of the difficulties involved in the uncertainty propagation. We
    have applied a Monte Carlo-based approach that allowed us to overcome those difficulties
    and to evaluate the uncertainty associated with spectral measurements carried
    out using a 12-bit CCD array of 2048 pixels, model SD2000, manufactured by Ocean
    Optics®. In the UV-A part of the spectrum the standard uncertainty was found to
    be roughly constant (about 5%). However, mostly due to the noise affecting the
    readings, a sharp increment was observed at wavelengths shorter than 315 nm; indeed,
    the driving factor determining the UV-B uncertainty (and in turn the UV index
    uncertainty) was the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Low SNRs lead to standard uncertainties
    greater than 20% for irradiances at 300 nm and greater than 10% for UV index values.
    Although each instrument has an individual character, comparable figures are expected
    in the case of instruments whose measurements undergo similar quality assurance
    activities (i.e. similar stray light correction methods). Our uncertainty figures
    provide a frame to assess the significance of differences when intercomparing,
    and in turn to check the quality of the measurements. The applied uncertainty
    evaluation methodology is general and agrees with recommendations of the ISO Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.</p>
