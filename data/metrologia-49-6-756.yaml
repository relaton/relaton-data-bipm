abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The concept system around ‘quantity’ and ‘quantity value’ is
    fundamental for measurement science, but some very basic issues are still open
    on such concepts and their relation. This paper argues that quantity values are
    in fact individual quantities, and that a complementarity exists between measurands
    and quantity values. This proposal is grounded on the analysis of three basic
    ‘equality’ relations: (i) between quantities, (ii) between quantity values and
    (iii) between quantities and quantity values. A consistent characterization of
    such concepts is obtained, which is then generalized to ‘property’ and ‘property
    value’. This analysis also throws some light on the elusive concept of magnitude.</p>'
