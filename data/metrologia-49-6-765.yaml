abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>It often happens that knowledge about a particular quantity
    has to be reached by processing a series of resolution-limited indications. It
    is a well-established fact that if the variability of the data is large compared
    with the resolution interval, the effect of discretization can be ignored. Otherwise,
    it needs to be taken into account since it can then be an important source of
    uncertainty, sometimes more significant than randomness itself. The objective
    of this paper is to derive a probability density function (pdf) for the value
    of a quantity based on discretized data. This pdf allows the standard uncertainty
    associated with the best estimate of the quantity to be computed and, perhaps
    more importantly, it can be used as an input to evaluate a measurement model in
    which the quantity is involved. Bayesian concepts are used towards this goal.
    Although reaching an appropriate pdf has been attempted before, limited success
    has been attained, as the pdfs that have been obtained exhibit some undesirable
    characteristics. Herein a new approach is proposed. Unlike previous efforts, this
    time the quantity of interest is modelled as a sum of two other quantities, one
    that can only assume discrete values and the other that takes values within the
    resolution interval centred on zero. The resulting pdf exhibits a satisfactory
    behaviour, but further work would be required to provide firmer theoretical grounds
    for the employed prior.</p>
