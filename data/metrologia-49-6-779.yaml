abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the results and discussion of two methods for achieving
    a higher degree of wavelength accuracy of double grating monochromators. In particular,
    we assessed the benefits of using differential evolution curve fitting techniques
    to minimize wavelength uncertainties associated with the manufacture of lead screws
    in sine-bar driven monochromators. Absolute wavelength-scale uncertainties better
    than ±0.1 nm can be realized using this technique.</p><p>We also report the realization
    of an accurate and repeatable wavelength scale, using a novel calibration technique,
    that is applicable to a wide range of monochromators. We present results demonstrating
    the robustness of the technique by realizing an absolute wavelength scale, across
    four grating sets from 250 nm to 1600 nm, with scale uncertainties within ±0.02 nm
    and repeatable to ±0.005 nm.</p>
