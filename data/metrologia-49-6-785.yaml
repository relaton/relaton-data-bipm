- content: Abstract<p>In part I, the feasibility of using three-dimensional (3D) finite
    elements (FEs) to model the acoustic behaviour of the IEC 60318-1 artificial ear
    was studied and the numerical approach compared with classical lumped elements
    modelling. It was shown that by using a more complex acoustic model that took
    account of thermo-viscous effects, geometric shapes and dimensions, it was possible
    to develop a realistic model. This model then had clear advantages in comparison
    with the models based on equivalent circuits using lumped parameters. In fact
    results from FE modelling produce a better understanding about the physical phenomena
    produced inside ear simulator couplers, facilitating spatial and temporal visualization
    of the sound fields produced.</p><p>The objective of this study (part II) is to
    extend the investigation by validating the numerical calculations against measurements
    on an ear simulator conforming to IEC 60318-1. For this purpose, an appropriate
    commercially available device is taken and a complete 3D FE model developed for
    it. The numerical model is based on key dimensional data obtained with a non-destructive
    x-ray inspection technique. Measurements of the acoustic transfer impedance have
    been carried out on the same device at a national measurement institute using
    the method embodied in IEC 60318-1. Having accounted for the actual device dimensions,
    the thermo-viscous effects inside narrow slots and holes and environmental conditions,
    the results of the numerical modelling were found to be in good agreement with
    the measured values.</p>
