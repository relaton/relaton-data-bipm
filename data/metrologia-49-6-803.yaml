- content: Abstract<p>The long-term stability of standard platinum resistance thermometers
    (SPRTs) in a temperature range between 0.01 °C and 419.527 °C was investigated
    from 352 samples of data accumulated from fixed-point calibration conducted during
    a period of eleven years. The rates of change of resistance R<sub>TPW</sub> at
    the triple point of water and the resistance ratio at the freezing point of Sn
    (W<sub>Sn</sub>) and Zn (W<sub>Zn</sub>) were analysed. For 75% of the samples
    investigated, the rate of change of R<sub>TPW</sub> was within 5.17 mK/year in
    magnitude. For the same portion of SPRTs, the rates of change in W<sub>Sn</sub>
    and W<sub>Zn</sub> were within 0.82 mK/year and 1.69 mK/year, respectively. Further
    statistical investigation showed that measurement at the triple point of water
    only was not a sufficient test to identify the change in W<sub>Sn</sub> or W<sub>Zn</sub>.
    However, due to the strong correlation between the changes in W<sub>Sn</sub> and
    W<sub>Zn</sub>, measurement of the resistance ratio at one of the fixed points
    in the range of usage is adequate to identify possible change in the entire range
    of usage.</p>
