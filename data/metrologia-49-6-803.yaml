    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The long-term stability of standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) in a temperature range between 0.01 °C and 419.527 °C was investigated from 352 samples of data accumulated from fixed-point calibration conducted during a period of eleven years. The rates of change of resistance <italic>R</italic><sub>TPW</sub> at the triple point of water and the resistance ratio at the freezing point of Sn (<italic>W</italic><sub>Sn</sub>) and Zn (<italic>W</italic><sub>Zn</sub>) were analysed. For 75% of the samples investigated, the rate of change of <italic>R</italic><sub>TPW</sub> was within 5.17 mK/year in magnitude. For the same portion of SPRTs, the rates of change in <italic>W</italic><sub>Sn</sub> and <italic>W</italic><sub>Zn</sub> were within 0.82 mK/year and 1.69 mK/year, respectively. Further statistical investigation showed that measurement at the triple point of water only was not a sufficient test to identify the change in <italic>W</italic><sub>Sn</sub> or <italic>W</italic><sub>Zn</sub>. However, due to the strong correlation between the changes in <italic>W</italic><sub>Sn</sub> and <italic>W</italic><sub>Zn</sub>, measurement of the resistance ratio at one of the fixed points in the range of usage is adequate to identify possible change in the entire range of usage.</p>
