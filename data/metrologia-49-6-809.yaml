    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p><italic>Metas.UncLib</italic> is a software library that facilitates the linear propagation of uncertainties through a measurement model. It is able to handle complex-valued and multivariate quantities and supports higher mathematics. It is therefore able to deal with advanced metrological problems that require, e.g., matrix manipulations. The software is optimized for short computation times and low memory use.</p>
