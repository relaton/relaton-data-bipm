abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A frequency–temperature coefficient (FTC) model for a magnetron
    cavity used in a passive hydrogen maser is proposed. The influences of the thermal
    expansion coefficient of the vane, strut and wall of the microwave cavity on the
    FTC are analysed. The results show that the FTC of the magnetron cavity can be
    reduced to a few hertz by choosing vanes and struts with proper expansion coefficients.
    A low-FTC cavity is fabricated according to the model. Experiments show that the
    FTC is reduced from −30 kHz K<sup>−1</sup> to 2.59 kHz K<sup>−1</sup> without
    using a quartz storage bulb.</p>
