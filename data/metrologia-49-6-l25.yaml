    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), at its 24th meeting, took note of the intention of the CIPM to revise the SI such that the new definition of the kilogram will be based on a fixed value of the Planck constant. Thus, any experiment providing a direct link between the Planck constant and a macroscopic mass, and not including any traceability to another primary kilogram standard, can be considered as a primary method for the realization of the new kilogram. In this letter we show that a silicon single crystal, as used in the Si-Avogadro experiment, is suitable as a primary kilogram standard according to the new proposed definition. We further discuss its potential with regard to the achievable relative uncertainty, which has to be 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> or better to serve all dissemination needs for the unit kilogram. This silicon route to the primary realization of the new kilogram represents a method which is completely independent of the alternative watt balance approach.</p>
