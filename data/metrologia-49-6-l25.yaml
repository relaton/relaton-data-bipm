abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), at its
    24th meeting, took note of the intention of the CIPM to revise the SI such that
    the new definition of the kilogram will be based on a fixed value of the Planck
    constant. Thus, any experiment providing a direct link between the Planck constant
    and a macroscopic mass, and not including any traceability to another primary
    kilogram standard, can be considered as a primary method for the realization of
    the new kilogram. In this letter we show that a silicon single crystal, as used
    in the Si-Avogadro experiment, is suitable as a primary kilogram standard according
    to the new proposed definition. We further discuss its potential with regard to
    the achievable relative uncertainty, which has to be 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> or better
    to serve all dissemination needs for the unit kilogram. This silicon route to
    the primary realization of the new kilogram represents a method which is completely
    independent of the alternative watt balance approach.</p>
