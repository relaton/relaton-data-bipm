abstract:
- content: "<p>Direct comparisons of the low-energy X-ray exposure standards of the
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the National Research Council
    of Canada (NRC), and also of the BIPM and the National Bureau of Standards of
    the USA (NBS), were made, using X rays generated at 10, 30 and 50 kV. The half-value
    layers for these qualities of radiation were 0.03<sub>6</sub>, 0.17<sub>6</sub>,
    and 2.25<sub>7</sub> mm of aluminum respectively. The results indicate that measurements
    with two free-air chambers can be made in the low-energy X-ray region with a discrepancy
    of less than 0.3%. The uncertainties and errors in the geometric and correction
    factors used for the comparison measurements, as well as other systematic and
    statistical errors, were examined in detail and are reported. The results of preliminary
    work on air attenuation corrections, diaphragm comparisons and saturation corrections
    are included.</p>"
