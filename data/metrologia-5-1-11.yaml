  content: "<p>Algorithms in series form are derived, suitable for computer calculation
    of capillary action in vertical cylindrical tubes. Concerning the capillary depression
    of mercury barometers and manometers they are shown to give, in the entire range
    of practical interest, results at least as accurate as tables based on numerical
    integration. They have, however, far more general application, since with their
    help capillary displacement, and the corresponding contact angles, can be calculated
    immediately also for other liquids and tube diameters.</p>"
