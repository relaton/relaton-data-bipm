  content: "<p>Double-balance a.c. bridge circuits are described, in which two or
    three sources generating voltages with 90Â° phase differences are used. Null balancing
    of both indicators may be rapidly and precisely accomplished if a certain succession
    of operations is observed and the four variable parameters are properly chosen.
    Particular types of such bridges allow familiar balance relations (such as those
    met with in classical Wien, resonance, Maxwell etc. bridges) to be reproduced,
    without series connection of the three-terminal bridge elements. Reciprocal comparisons
    of resistance, inductance and capacitance standards by using these bridges were
    carried out; typical values of errors observed were 1...2 ppm.</p>"
