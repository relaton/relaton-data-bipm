abstract:
- content: "<p>The volt box is designed to have facilities for self-calibration. The
    calibration is based on the well-known principle of series- and parallel-connection
    of equal resistors, which limits the number of measurements. For establishing
    the correction of any arbitrary ratio for a box equipped with twenty-seven ratios
    not more than six measurements are needed. The ratio error for a prototype box
    is estimated not to exceed 1 ppm.</p>"
