abstract:
- content: "<p>Whereas the limitation imposed by the IPTS on the value of E<sub>Au</sub>
    merely confines the rhodium content to the neighbourhood of 10% wt, values of
    (E<sub>Au</sub> - E<sub>Ag</sub>) and (E<sub>Au</sub> - E<sub>Sb</sub>) are intensitive
    to the rhodium content and depend largely on the quality of the materials. Unfortunately
    the existing criteria based on the latter values are numerically inadequate and
    as a result give preference to wires low in quality. This article critically examines
    the e.m.f. criteria and suggests modifications to improve their efficiency.</p>"
