  content: "<p>Measurements have been made of the effects of changes in atmospheric
    humidity on the irradiance from an incandescent lamp, for test distances 1 and
    3 m and for a range of water-vapour pressures 1 to 15 torr. With a 1 m path the
    absorptance of the vapour is proportional to the vapour pressure, but with a 3
    m path the relationship is non-linear.</p>"
