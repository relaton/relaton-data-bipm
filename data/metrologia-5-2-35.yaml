    <p>The Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) at
    its meeting in October 1968 agreed to adopt the International
    Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68) in accordance
    with the decision of the 13<sup>e</sup> Conférence Générale des Poids
    et Mesures, Resolution 8, of October 1967. This resolution gave
    the CIPM permission to introduce a new Scale to replace the
    existing IPTS-48 as soon as the Comité Consultatif de Thermométrie (CCT) made its recommendations.</p>
    <p>There were two important reasons for revising the IPTS-48.
    The first of these was the need to extend the Scale to lower
    temperatures to achieve a unification of the existing national
    scales in the region 10 K–90 K. Secondly the Scale had not
    been revised significantly over the range from −183 °C to
    1063 °C since its inception in 1927, and modern gas thermometer measurements showed that the Scale gave values considerably different from thermodynamic temperatures.</p>
    <p>The CCT agreed on the basic data and methods of interpolation for a new definition of the IPTS at its 8th meeting
    held in Washington and Ottawa in September 1967. Provision
    was made to extend the Scale down to 13.81 K, the triple point
    of equilibrium hydrogen, and for the use of the best known
    values of thermodynamic temperatures. The value of  <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub> used
    in the Planck equation was also revised as a result of a better
    knowledge of the values of fundamental physical constants.</p>
    <p>The CCT appointed a small sub-committee to prepare a text
    of the definition of the IPTS-68 in accordance with its recommendations, with instructions to resolve some points of detail.
    The final draft of the English text, which is reproduced below,
    received the approval of all members of the CCT before it was
    submitted to the CIPM. The official text of the IPTS-68 is
    the French text which was prepared by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures from the English text, and is
    published as an annexe to Comptes rendus des séances de la
    Treizième Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures.</p>
