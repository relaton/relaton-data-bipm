abstract:
- content: "<p>Between 13.81 K and 273.15 K, standard platinum resistance thermometer
    calibrations on the IPTS-68 are referred to the CCT-68 W versus T reference function,
    which is designed to simulate as closely as possible the behaviour of a typical
    high-quality resistance thermometer. In choosing the function the authors took
    account of: a number of thermodynamic temperature measurements in various laboratories;
    an intercomparison of several of these scales; and certain requirements for internal
    consistency in the function. These considerations were to some extent conflicting,
    and an element of judgment was required in effecting a compromise between them.</p>"
