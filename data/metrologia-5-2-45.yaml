  content: "<p>Between 13.81 K and 273.15 K, standard platinum resistance thermometer
    calibrations on the IPTS-68 are referred to the CCT-68 <italic>W</italic> versus
    <italic>T</italic> reference function, which is designed to simulate as closely
    as possible the behaviour of a typical high-quality resistance thermometer. In
    choosing the function the authors took account of: a number of thermodynamic temperature
    measurements in various laboratories; an intercomparison of several of these scales;
    and certain requirements for internal consistency in the function. These considerations
    were to some extent conflicting, and an element of judgment was required in effecting
    a compromise between them.</p>"
