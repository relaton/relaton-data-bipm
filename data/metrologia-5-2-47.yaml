abstract:
- content: "<p>In the region 13.81 K to 90.188 K the IPTS-68 will replace a number
    of previously used low temperature scales, four of which are NBS-55, NPL-61, PRMI-54,
    and PSU-54. It is desirable to know the relationships between these scales and
    the IPTS-68. At the present time these relationships can be determined, though
    indirectly and somewhat inaccurately, by means of an earlier intercomparison of
    the scales, their relationships to the CCT-64 table, and estimates of the values
    of the defining fixed point temperatures of the IPTS-68 on this table. Values
    of these relationships are presented.</p>"
