abstract:
- content: "<p>Results of a series of observations on the linear thermal expansion
    coefficient of transparent fused quartz are given in the temperature range of
    300 °C to 1065°C, with particular attention being given to the region of 1000
    °C.</p><p>The experiments are carried out by the comparator method. The ten specimens,
    which could conveniently be classified into three types, were supplied by the
    Thermal Syndicate Ltd., England and by three manufacturers, the Toshiba Ceramics
    Ltd., the Nippon Sekiei Garasu Ltd. and the Kimmon Manufacturing Ltd., in Japan.</p><p>Different
    value is obtained in thermal expansion of the specimens each type for which an
    empirical formula is given.</p>"
