    <p>Results of a series of observations on the linear thermal expansion coefficient of transparent fused quartz are given in the temperature range of 300 °C to 1065°C, with particular attention being given to the region of 1000 °C.</p>
    <p>The experiments are carried out by the comparator method. The ten specimens, which could conveniently be classified into three types, were supplied by the Thermal Syndicate Ltd., England and by three manufacturers, the Toshiba Ceramics Ltd., the Nippon Sekiei Garasu Ltd. and the Kimmon Manufacturing Ltd., in Japan.</p>
    <p>Different value is obtained in thermal expansion of the specimens each type for which an empirical formula is given.</p>
