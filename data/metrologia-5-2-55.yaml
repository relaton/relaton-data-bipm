abstract:
- content: "<p>An electric analogue network is described, by the aid of which values
    obtained from pair comparison measurements can be readily corrected for inconsistencies
    due to random errors. A proof is given that the network method is mathematically
    equivalent to the method of least squares and, hence, that it leads to the most
    probable values. It is further discussed how pair comparison measurements should
    be organized in order to yield with a minimum of computation work the most probable
    values.</p>"
