abstract:
- content: "<p>The factors which contribute to the variation of resistance with power
    dissipated in standard resistors are investigated in some detail. In addition
    to the change in resistance to be expected from a uniform temperature rise there
    are effects which result from a non-uniform temperature distribution. An important
    contribution may arise from the inclusion of copper terminations in the defined
    resistance.</p><p>The relevant heat transfer theory is outlined and applied to
    the design of resistors with forced-convection oil cooling. Such cooling applied
    to a conventional 1 Î© resistance standard reduced the temperature rise with power
    dissipated by some 25 times.</p>"
