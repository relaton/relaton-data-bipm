abstract:
- content: "<p>Three different experimental atomic time scales have been maintained
    at the National Research Council of Canada. One has been based on an HP 5061A
    cesium standard, another on a free-running crystal oscillator, calibrated daily
    with respect to the NRC 2.1 m primary cesium standard, and a third on the HP 5061A
    calibrated weekly by the primary standard. VLF and Loran C intercomparisons with
    the United States Naval Observatory and the National Bureau of Standards indicate
    that the third is probably the most accurate of the three time scales. Agreement
    between this scale and those of the USNO and NBS is of the order of 1 μsec or
    1 × 10<sup>-13</sup> in frequency over a four-month period.</p>"
