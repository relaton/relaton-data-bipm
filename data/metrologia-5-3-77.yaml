  content: "<p>The triple point of pure Argon has been measured and the value obtained
    is <italic>t</italic>* = -189.3331 °C where <italic>t</italic>* refers to a temperature
    scale obtained by extrapolating the Callendarvan Dusen equation. Several samples
    from two suppliers were used and all the results obtained were within a spread
    of ½ mK The experiments indicated that large thermal gradients may easily be set
    up within the melting Argon sample and that rather careful heat leak control and
    experimental procedure is necessary for precise melting point determination.</p>"
