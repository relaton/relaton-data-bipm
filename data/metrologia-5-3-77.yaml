abstract:
- content: "<p>The triple point of pure Argon has been measured and the value obtained
    is t* = -189.3331 °C where t* refers to a temperature scale obtained by extrapolating
    the Callendarvan Dusen equation. Several samples from two suppliers were used
    and all the results obtained were within a spread of ½ mK The experiments indicated
    that large thermal gradients may easily be set up within the melting Argon sample
    and that rather careful heat leak control and experimental procedure is necessary
    for precise melting point determination.</p>"
