  content: "<p>Using a bent crystal spectrometer the Al Kα<sub>1,2</sub> and α<sub>3</sub>
    lines recorded in the first order of reflexion from quartz have been directly
    compared with the Cu Kα<sub>1</sub> line recorded in the fifth order. The wavelength
    values of the Al K lines in Å units, determined by Edlén and Svensson from Tyrén's
    experimental work, have been used to calculate the conversion constants Λ and
    Λ*. The weighted mean value of Λ is found to be 1.002047 ± 0.000022 mÅ/XU and
    of Λ* 0.999972 ± 0.000022 Å/A*.</p>"
