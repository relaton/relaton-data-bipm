abstract:
- content: "<p>In 1964 the authors published preliminary results of their work on
    establishing the practical temperature scale in the temperature range from 4.2
    K to 20 K. The temperature scale for this range was defined using a germanium
    resistance thermometer, as its sensitivity and reproducibility of readings are
    as good as it is required for the most accurate determinations of temperature.
    At the same time germanium thermometers have noticeable defects among which the
    main one is non-reproducibility of temperature dependence of its resistance from
    sample to sample, but no better thermometers for this range are available now.</p><p>The
    results of the well-known works on establishing IPTS in the temperature range
    from 12 K to 273 K show that even the platinum-thermometers cannot be fitted a
    sufficiently simple analytical resistance-temperature function. The only method
    which appears to be acceptable for semiconductor resistance thermometers is the
    table method.</p><p>The establishment of a temperature scale by any method possible
    involves calibration of the secondary (in our case germanium) thermometers against
    a primary device reproducing the thermodynamic temperature scale. As a primary
    instrument we used a gas thermometer without a dead space. Four thoroughly examines
    germanium thermometers formed a standard group, conserving a temperature scale
    defined by individual curves T = T(W) for each thermometer of the standard group
    (the resistance ratio W = R<sub>T</sub>/R<sub>H<sub>2</sub></sub>). Based on smooth
    W(T) tables, obtained as a result of the standard thermometers' calibration against
    the gas thermometer, tables have been made, to be used for converting resistance
    values of the standard thermometers into temperature values.</p><p>The temperature
    in our scale is defined as an average of readings of the standard group thermometers.
    This paper presents a detailed description of the work on establishing the temperature
    scale.</p>"
