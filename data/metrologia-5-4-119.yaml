abstract:
- content: "<p>A new thermal neutron flux convention is proposed where the neutron
    slowing down spectrum per unit energy varies as 1/E<sup>1+β</sup> (| β ln E |
    &lt;&lt; 1). The neutron capture rate per atom for a detector may be written as
    nν<sub>0</sub> σ<sub>0</sub> [G<sub>th</sub>g(T) + f C(β, T) G<sub>r</sub>h(β,
    G<sub>r</sub>)I'/σ<sub>0</sub>] where n is the neutron density, ν<sub>0</sub>
    is the conventional 2200 m/s velocity, σ<sub>0</sub> is the 2200 m/s neutron capture
    cross-section, C(β, T) is a renormalisation correction to the epithermal flux
    fraction f at temperature T, h(β) is the correction to the reduced resonance integral
    I' defined for a 1/E flux, g(T) is the Westcott function and G<sub>th</sub> and
    G<sub>r</sub> are the thermal and resonance self-shielding factors. For the case
    β = 0 this expression reduces to the Westcott form.</p><p>Tables of h(β) are presented
    for a number of commonly used isotopes, and C(β, T) has also been tabulated.</p><p>A
    simple experimental method for measuring β is given which only involves the ratio
    of the cadmium-covered activities of standard manganese and gold detector foils,
    and the method has been applied to several different standard neutron flux assemblies.</p>"
