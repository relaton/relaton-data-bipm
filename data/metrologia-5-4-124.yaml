abstract:
- content: "<p>Hitherto low-field measurements of the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton,
    γ<sub>p</sub>, have involved measurements of all the length parameters describing
    a rigid coil system producing the necessary magnetic field. This paper shows how,
    in principle, this task may be reduced to measurements of a single variable parameter.
    A practicable design is discussed which is capable of taking advantage of the
    precision of the<sup>86</sup>Kr length standard. Such an apparatus could be used
    for maintaining the ampere, and the improved precision of γ<sub>p</sub> could
    be used in conjunction with the values of e/h from the Josephson effect together
    with values of other precise constants to derive a value for the fine structure
    constant which is independent of Quantum Electrodynamical theory.</p>"
