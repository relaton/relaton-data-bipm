abstract:
- content: "<p>Four closely spaced rings form a capacitor with useful characteristics.
    Perturbations from the cross-sectional symmetry have a second order effect on
    the mean value of capacitance between the two diagonally opposite rings. The capacitance
    is then determined by the mean diameters only and has been computed to an accuracy
    of one part in one million.</p>"
