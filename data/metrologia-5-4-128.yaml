  content: "<p>An extensive program of neutron source calibrations using an improved
    manganese bath technique has been completed. Sources generating four neutron spectra
    were compared at different concentrations of manganese. The results of this work
    provide correction factors for fast neutron absorption; the Argonne values markedly
    disagree with some widely accepted work but agree with computations based on the
    latest cross sections for oxygen and sulfur, compounded with certain assumptions
    regarding source spectra. Neutron source rates obtained are (3.223 ± 0.014) ×
    10<sup>6</sup> neutrons/sec referred to January 1, 1962 for the NRC International
    Standard source N-200-1, and (1.1776 ± 0.0043) × 10<sup>6</sup> neutrons/sec for
    the NBS-II source referred to January 1, 1965. About half of the assigned error
    is statistical imprecision and the remainder is an estimate of systematic error
    (all with confidence coefficient of 0.68). Although the result obtained for the
    international standard agrees with the world average well within the assigned
    error, there still exist some distinguishable systematic discrepancies with other
    published data.</p>"
