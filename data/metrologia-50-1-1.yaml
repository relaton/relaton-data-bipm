abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The gravitational attraction of the body of a gravity meter
    upon its own proof mass is sometimes called the self-attraction. The self-attraction
    is a source of systematic error for absolute measurements of g, the acceleration
    of an object due to Earth's gravity. While the effect is typically small—of the
    order of one part per billion of the Earth's gravitational attraction—it is significant
    at the current level of accuracy of absolute gravity meters. In the past, a self-attraction
    correction for the FG5 gravity meter has been estimated by considering a rather
    coarse description of the instrument using simple geometrical shapes (spheres
    and cylinders). This paper describes a more complete calculation using a CAD-based
    digitized model of the newest FG5X instrument. We have also included the attraction
    of the co-moving drag-free chamber as well as the self-attraction of the counterweights
    used in the FG5X to reduce recoil. The results are also applicable to older style
    FG5 instruments with a fibre-optic interferometer base. The correction found with
    this new approach agrees with previous estimates but is now based upon a more
    complete and accurate model.</p>
