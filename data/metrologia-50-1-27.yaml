    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The stability of reference masses has been a long-standing concern within the SI. More recently the requirements of potential non-artefact realizations of the kilogram have added gold and its alloys to the platinum alloys that have historically been the focus of attention.</p>
    <p>Previously we proposed UV/ozone cleaning of standard-mass surfaces to improve stability with respect to carbonaceous contamination. Since then both NPL and BIPM have constructed prototypes of UV/ozone apparatus for cleaning kilogram standards. We have therefore tested a combined solvent wash and UV/ozone procedure, UVOPS or ‘UV/ozone with pre-wash and stabilization’, on both platinum and gold surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows this to be very successful in removing even gross contamination from these noble metal surfaces. Oxidation is negligible, limited to the outermost layer of noble metal atoms, and terminates at a level that is within the uncertainty of mass comparisons at the 1 kg level. This oxide has been seen in some earlier XPS studies but not others—we show that decomposition of the oxide by x-rays at XPS energies may be responsible for this disparity.</p>
