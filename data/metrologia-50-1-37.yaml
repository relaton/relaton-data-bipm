abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>RLCYC 75 is a new electrically calibrated laser calorimeter
    specially manufactured by Laser Metrology to calibrate energy diagnostics within
    the Laser MegaJoule (LMJ) facility. It consists of an optical cavity cooled by
    a hydraulic system. The system is designed to provide 1 µm wavelength power laser
    measurements with uncertainty less than 1% at 2 kW and traceability to the International
    System of Units (SI). In this paper, the accuracy of RLCYC 75 measurements is
    studied. More precisely, three points are detailed: instrumentation uncertainty
    estimation, equivalence between optical and electrical supply and light absorption.
    To this end, electrical calibration campaigns and power laser measurement campaigns
    are conducted. Moreover, thermal and optical models are developed. Results show
    that RLCYC 75 design and instrumentation are efficient enough to reach the goal
    of relative uncertainty of about 1% at 2 kW. RLCYC 75 will become the 2 kW laser
    power primary standard for LMJ applications.</p>'
