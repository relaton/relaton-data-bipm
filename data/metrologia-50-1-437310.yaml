abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The main factor that affects the extension of the lower limit
    of a constant conductance gas flowmeter is the outgassing of the inner surface
    of the ballast chamber and pipes. A novel method is demonstrated to extend the
    lower limit using a non-evaporable getter (NEG) pump to eliminate the outgassing
    influence. The NEG pump has two remarkable characteristics: one is the large pumping
    speed for active gases especially for hydrogen at ambient temperature, and the
    other is no pumping speed for inert gases. It is known from numerous experimental
    investigations on outgassing that the residual gas inside an ultrahigh vacuum
    and extremely high vacuum (UHV/XHV) facility made of stainless steel is virtually
    pure hydrogen. So it can reduce the outgassing influence and maintain a low base
    pressure without changing the test gas quantity in the ballast chamber when inert
    gas is used as the test gas. By this method, the lower limit of the constant conductance
    gas flowmeter is successfully extended to 10<sup>−12</sup> Pa m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>
    (at 23 °C) with a combined relative standard uncertainty of 0.94% (k = 1). A vacuum
    leak with a leak rate of 10<sup>−10</sup> Pa m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (at
    23 °C) is calibrated, and the uncertainty of the non-linearity of a quadrupole
    mass spectrometer is avoided. An ionization gauge is calibrated in the pressure
    range from 10<sup>−10</sup> Pa to 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa with the dynamic expansion
    method, and the uncertainty of conductance ratio is avoided compared with the
    separated flow method.</p>'
