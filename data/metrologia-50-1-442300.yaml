abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A decision problem frequently occurring in metrology is that
    of compatibility of data obtained by two (or several) different laboratories,
    methods or instruments. One laboratory can be a prestigious national metrology
    institute whose data are considered to be a gold standard or a certified reference
    material interval. When each laboratory presents its results in the form of a
    coverage interval for the measurand, several statistical approaches to this conformity
    assessment problem are reviewed including the classical ‘equality of means’ hypotheses
    tests. A new compatibility hypothesis is formulated in terms of consistency of
    laboratory results and compliance with a maximum permitted uncertainty. The power
    functions of these tests are compared numerically. The Kullback–Leibler information
    number is suggested as a directional (asymmetric) interchangeability index.</p>
