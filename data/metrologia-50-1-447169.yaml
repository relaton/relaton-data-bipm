abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The stability of reference masses has been a long-standing concern
    within the SI. More recently the requirements of potential non-artefact realizations
    of the kilogram have added gold and its alloys to the platinum alloys that have
    historically been the focus of attention.</p><p>Previously we proposed UV/ozone
    cleaning of standard-mass surfaces to improve stability with respect to carbonaceous
    contamination. Since then both NPL and BIPM have constructed prototypes of UV/ozone
    apparatus for cleaning kilogram standards. We have therefore tested a combined
    solvent wash and UV/ozone procedure, UVOPS or ‘UV/ozone with pre-wash and stabilization’,
    on both platinum and gold surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows
    this to be very successful in removing even gross contamination from these noble
    metal surfaces. Oxidation is negligible, limited to the outermost layer of noble
    metal atoms, and terminates at a level that is within the uncertainty of mass
    comparisons at the 1 kg level. This oxide has been seen in some earlier XPS studies
    but not others—we show that decomposition of the oxide by x-rays at XPS energies
    may be responsible for this disparity.</p>
