abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Since 1889 the international prototype of the kilogram has served
    as the definition of the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI).
    It is the last material artefact to define a base unit of the SI, and it influences
    several other base units. This situation is no longer acceptable in a time of
    ever increasing measurement precision.</p><p>It is therefore planned to redefine
    the unit of mass by fixing the numerical value of the Planck constant. At the
    same time three other base units, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole, will be
    redefined. As a first step, the kilogram redefinition requires a highly accurate
    determination of the Planck constant in the present SI system, with a relative
    uncertainty of the order of 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>.</p><p>The most promising
    experiment for this purpose, and for the future realization of the kilogram, is
    the watt balance. It compares mechanical and electrical power and makes use of
    two macroscopic quantum effects, thus creating a relationship between a macroscopic
    mass and the Planck constant.</p><p>In this paper the background for the choice
    of the Planck constant for the kilogram redefinition is discussed and the role
    of the Planck constant in physics is briefly reviewed. The operating principle
    of watt balance experiments is explained and the existing experiments are reviewed.
    An overview is given of all presently available experimental determinations of
    the Planck constant, and it is shown that further investigation is needed before
    the redefinition of the kilogram can take place.</p>
