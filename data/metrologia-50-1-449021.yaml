abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The removal of a high mercury contamination on a Pt reference
    mass by thermal desorption was studied directly by x-ray photoemission spectroscopy
    (XPS). Subsequently the contamination mechanism was investigated. Samples of PtIr
    and AuPt exposed to vapour of mercury in air were studied using XPS and gravimetric
    mass determination. We find an extremely rapid mercury contamination which takes
    place within minutes and reaches an initial equilibrium state after 2 h to 4 h.
    Roughly 1 to 2 monolayers of mercury adsorbs directly on the metal surface. A
    natural contamination of carbon and oxygen compounds is at the top. Due to the
    accumulation of mercury, we find a gain in mass which corresponds to 20 µg to
    26 µg for a PtIr standard. XPS data from a historical Pt standard give strong
    evidence for further average mercury accumulation of (1.3 ± 0.1) µg/year during
    a period of more than a century. This can be explained by a two-step mechanism
    presented in this study. The speed of contamination depends on the initial surface
    conditions. Polishing activates the surface and results in an enhanced accumulation
    of mercury. Natural contamination by C and O can delay but not prevent contamination.
    We further demonstrate that the mercury contamination can be removed by both hydrogen
    plasma and thermal desorption. The removal of mercury by hydrogen plasma can directly
    be attributed to the synthesis of gaseous mercury dihydrides at low pressures.</p>
