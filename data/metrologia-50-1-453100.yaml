abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The new cleaning techniques of low-pressure hydrogen plasma
    and UV/ozone were studied on stainless steel used in the manufacture of high-quality
    weight pieces, rhodium and gold using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
    a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) for direct mass determination. Both cleaning
    techniques were directly compared with respect to the achieved cleanliness, the
    remaining contaminants, the speed of action and the change in mass. Both techniques
    proved to be very efficient for the removal of carbon compounds. Hydrogen plasma
    additionally also reduces oxides and oxygen compounds, whereas UV/ozone leads
    to an oxidation of weight steel and rhodium. Plasma cleaning is two to four times
    faster than UV/ozone and the remaining amount of contamination is lower. Cyclic
    cleaning using both techniques by turns clearly demonstrated that both modern
    methods delivered for each technique different but repeatedly and reversibly the
    same surface chemical state. The change in mass monitored directly with a QCM
    is in good agreement with the XPS data. The recontamination of the gold-coated
    quartz crystal after hydrogen plasma was monitored with the microbalance in situ.
    The gain in mass due to the accumulation of carbonaceous contamination can be
    explained by a self-limited growth model proposed recently.</p>
