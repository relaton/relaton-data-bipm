    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The dynamic pressure effects and their corrections in a high-speed, clearance-sealed realization of a piston prover for gas flow measurements are discussed. The experimental results show the deterministic, rather than stochastic, nature of the dynamic pressure conditions and, consequently, the repeatable nature of their influence on the flow measurements. The experimental validation proves the advantage of the polytropic/adiabatic pressure correction model, which was proposed by the authors, as compared with the isothermal pressure correction model. The paper ends with an estimation of the measurement uncertainty related to the pressure corrections using either the adiabatic or isothermal model.</p>
