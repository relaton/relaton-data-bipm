abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A quasi-elastic electrostatic oscillation method is proposed
    for the absolute determination of inertial mass, which is distinguished from the
    gravitational mass measurement in the watt balance experiment. The value of the
    kilogram is determined by comparing oscillation periods of the quasi-elastic electrostatic
    oscillator with different test masses and applying different dc voltages on a
    symmetrical twin-Kelvin-capacitor system. The required measuring quantities for
    this method include the capacitance, voltage, vertical distance and oscillation
    periods, which in principle can be measured with high accuracy. In addition, this
    experiment is insensitive to the air buoyancy and the heating problem, and it
    can be operated in air. Both the theory and experimental verifications are presented.</p>
