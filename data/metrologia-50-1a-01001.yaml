abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Four National Metrology Institutes, among them three EURAMET members, participated in the follow-up comparison EURAMET.EM-K2.1. The comparison aimed at evaluating the degrees of equivalence of the measurements of 10 MΩ and 1 GΩ resistance standards. Through the pilot laboratory, the results are linked to comparisons EUROMET.EM-K2 and CCEM-K2 respectively. At 1 GΩ, all results supplied by the participants agreed with the comparison reference value within the expanded uncertainty. At 10 MΩ, a slight disagreement with the KCRV for three of the four participants was observed.</p><p>Main text.
