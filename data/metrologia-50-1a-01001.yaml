    <p>Four National Metrology Institutes, among them three EURAMET members, participated in the follow-up comparison EURAMET.EM-K2.1. The comparison aimed at evaluating the degrees of equivalence of the measurements of 10 MΩ and 1 GΩ resistance standards. Through the pilot laboratory, the results are linked to comparisons <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/47/1A/01006/">EUROMET.EM-K2</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/39/1A/1">CCEM-K2</ext-link> respectively. At 1 GΩ, all results supplied by the participants agreed with the comparison reference value within the expanded uncertainty. At 10 MΩ, a slight disagreement with the KCRV for three of the four participants was observed.</p>
