    <p>For the first time, a EURAMET comparison was performed in the field of small DC currents below 1 nA. The capabilities of thirteen European and non-European National Metrology Institutes for traceable calibrations of picoammeters have been compared. For that purpose, two different commercial picoammeters were used as travelling instruments. They were calibrated at current values of ±100 fA, ±1 pA, ±10 pA and ±100 pA. The accuracy achieved was to a large extent limited by the stability of the travelling instruments. The expanded relative uncertainty (k = 2) of the reference values varied between 2.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup> and 1.9 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, depending on the current ranges and the travelling instruments. There was a good agreement between the results of most of the participants.</p><p>Main text.
