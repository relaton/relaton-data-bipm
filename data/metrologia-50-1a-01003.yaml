    <p>The comparison COOMET No 396/UA/07 of AC voltage ratio standards is registered in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB) as supplementary comparison COOMET.EM-S5. It was conducted from June 2008 to July 2010 and involved the National Metrology Institutes of the Republic of Belarus, Georgia, the Russian Federation, the Czech Republic and Ukraine.</p>
    <p>SE "Ukrmetrteststandard" (Ukraine) was the Pilot laboratory for this exercise.</p>
    <p>The final report lists all data of measurement results and declared uncertainties as obtained by the participating NMIs.</p>
    <p>The degrees to which the values of the national standards correspond to the reference values of the supplementary comparison are quantitatively evaluated with the conclusions that the results obtained are recognized to be consistent taking into account the declared uncertainties. This gives evidence for supporting the corresponding Calibration and Measurement Capabilities for those values of voltage ratio at which NMIs have performed measurements.</p>
