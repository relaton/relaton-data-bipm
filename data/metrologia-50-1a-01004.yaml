    <p>A comparison of DC voltage standards between the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and the Vietnam Metrology Institute (VMI) was carried from 2 July to 17 August 2012. The comparison was made at the 1.018 V and the 10 V levels by measuring two Zener references which were hand-carried for a quick transfer between the two laboratories. The difference between the measurements was −0.9 µV with an uncertainty of 1.5 µV at 95% level of confidence for the 10 V level, 0.0 µV with an uncertainty of 0.2 µV at 95% level of confidence for the 1.018 V level.</p>
