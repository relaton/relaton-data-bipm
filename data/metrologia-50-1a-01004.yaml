abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of DC voltage standards between the Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science (KRISS) and the Vietnam Metrology Institute (VMI) was
    carried from 2 July to 17 August 2012. The comparison was made at the 1.018 V
    and the 10 V levels by measuring two Zener references which were hand-carried
    for a quick transfer between the two laboratories. The difference between the
    measurements was −0.9 µV with an uncertainty of 1.5 µV at 95% level of confidence
    for the 10 V level, 0.0 µV with an uncertainty of 0.2 µV at 95% level of confidence
    for the 1.018 V level.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper,

    B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
