abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The objective of this comparison was to compare the measurement capabilities of seven NMIs within the SIM region in the field of capacitance. This action was aimed at determining the degree of equivalence of measuring capabilities in capacitance.</p><p>The proposed test points were selected to evaluate the measuring capabilities of the participants, both their measurement standards and their measurement procedures. SIM has thus undertaken three related capacitance comparisons: SIM.EM-K4, a key comparison of a 10 pF fused-silica standard at 1000 Hz and 1600 Hz; SIM.EM-S4, a supplementary comparison of a 100 pF fused-silica standard at 1000 Hz and 1600 Hz; and SIM.EM-S3, a supplementary comparison of a 1000 pF nitrogen gas standard capacitor at 1000 Hz. Furthermore, the results of key comparison SIM.EM-K4 are linked to those of the corresponding CCEM key comparison (CCEM-K4).</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
