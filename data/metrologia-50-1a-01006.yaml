    <p>The purpose of this bilateral comparison is to check the conformance of the base quantities of magnetic measurements, DC magnetic flux density and its ratio to a current, as reproduced at VNIIM and KRISS. In these institutes adequate conditions for precise measurements in low magnetic fields are provided and the appropriate equipment for attaining a high level of accuracy is available.</p><p>The results in this report cover the comparisons of two units, T/A and T, reproduced by the two institutes. The experimental comparison data show good agreement within the estimated uncertainty components of the standards. The coordinated values of the unit of DC magnetic flux density and its ratios to DC current show a standard uncertainty at the level of 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> to 1.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (k = 1) using the value of the gyromagnetic ratio of the shielded protons γ<sub>p</sub> that was recommended by CODATA in 2010, the experimental determination of the ratio (γ<sub><sup>4</sup>He</sub>/γ<sub>p</sub>) of<sup>4</sup>He atoms to protons, and the standards of the two institutes.</p><p>The results give a basis for carrying out multilateral comparisons of standard quantum magnetometers of metrological institutes in the framework of APMP with participation of geomagnetic observatories, which require the establishment of a unified standard of the unit of DC magnetic flux density. They also show the possibility of decreasing the uncertainty of the determination of the unit of DC magnetic flux density from direct comparisons of standard quantum magnetometers.</p><p>Main text.
