    <p>A comparison of electric field measurements was carried out between January 2010 and July 2012 amongst fourteen national metrology laboratories at frequencies 1 GHz, 2.45 GHz, 10 GHz and 18 GHz at indicated field levels of 10 V/m, 30 V/m and 100 V/m. The identification of this intercomparison is CCEM.RF-K24.F. Two electric field probes provided by Amplifier Research have been measured as the travelling standards. The National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) acted as the pilot laboratory for the comparison. This report contains the results of the measurements.</p>
