abstract:
- content: "<p>Resistance standards with values in the TΩ range play an important
    role in electrical instrumentation. The calibration of such standards is, thus,
    a service offered by many metrology institutes. The techniques used to measure
    very high resistance values differ quite substantially from the calibration techniques
    applied in the lower resistance ranges. For this reason, the EURAMET technical
    committee for electricity and magnetism decided in 2008 to organise for the first
    time a supplementary comparison of resistance at 1 TΩ and 100 TΩ based on well
    characterized travelling standards.</p><p>Eighteen European National Metrology
    Institutes participated in the comparison. With some exceptions, the results supplied
    by the participants agree reasonably well with the comparison reference value
    within the expanded uncertainty.</p><p>As observed in other resistance comparisons,
    the characteristics of the standards used as transport artefacts ultimately limit
    the accuracy of comparisons in this field. The transport behaviour is difficult
    to model and introduces an undesired bias in the laboratory results. The transport
    uncertainties are at the level of the uncertainties claimed by some of the participants
    and, thus, limit the meaningfulness of the comparison results.</p><p>Another remarkable
    observation is the big difference in the uncertainty statements made by the participants,
    even in cases where similar measurement systems were used. The results of the
    comparison allow the participants to critically review their measurement procedures
    and uncertainty models.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper,

    B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EURAMET, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
