    <p>This supplementary intercomparison was requested by VNIIOFI in order to establish the link with previous works, which were performed in the frame of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/43/1A/02001">EUROMET-PR.S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/44/1A/02003">EUROMET-PR.S1.1</ext-link>. This bilateral intercomparison was carried out by using the same rules and technical procedures that were applied for the two previous studies. Measurements of the total chromatic dispersion, of the zero dispersion wavelength and of the dispersion slope were performed on two references, namely one G.652 fibre and one G.653 fibre. The measurement of the chromatic dispersion and of the dispersion slope showed a very good agreement between VNIIOFI and METAS results. The determination of the zero dispersion wavelength of the G.653 fibre showed deviations that were at the limit of the measurement uncertainty. This bilateral intercomparison allowed the VNIIOFI measurement system to be validated and also provided the link to the results of the EUROMET-PR.S1 project.</p>
