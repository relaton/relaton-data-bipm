abstract:
- content: "<p>This supplementary intercomparison was requested by VNIIOFI in order
    to establish the link with previous works, which were performed in the frame of
    \ EUROMET-PR.S1  and  EUROMET-PR.S1.1. This bilateral intercomparison was carried
    out by using the same rules and technical procedures that were applied for the
    two previous studies. Measurements of the total chromatic dispersion, of the zero
    dispersion wavelength and of the dispersion slope were performed on two references,
    namely one G.652 fibre and one G.653 fibre. The measurement of the chromatic dispersion
    and of the dispersion slope showed a very good agreement between VNIIOFI and METAS
    results. The determination of the zero dispersion wavelength of the G.653 fibre
    showed deviations that were at the limit of the measurement uncertainty. This
    bilateral intercomparison allowed the VNIIOFI measurement system to be validated
    and also provided the link to the results of the EUROMET-PR.S1 project.</p><p>
