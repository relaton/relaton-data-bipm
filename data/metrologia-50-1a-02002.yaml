    <p>This report contains the results of the regional comparison EUROMET PR-K2.b (registered in the KCDB under the identifier EURAMET.PR-K2.b). Ten laboratories took part in it, including the pilot. In general the results are consistent, with a few exceptions as explained in the report.</p><p>The comparison gives international linkage in spectral responsivity from 300 nm to 1000 nm to seven European laboratories: Bundesamt für Metrologie und Akkreditierung (METAS), Norwegian Metrology and Accreditation Service (Justervesenet), Central Office of Measures (GUM), National Institute of Metrology (INM-Romania), Optics Laboratory of TUBITAK-UME (UME), Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) and Swedish National Testing and Research Institute (SP). Three laboratories provided the link to CCPR-K2.b: Bureau National de Metrologie (BNM-INM/CNAM), Instituto de Optica 'Daza de Valdés' (IO-CSIC, acting as pilot) and NMi Van Swinden Laboratorium BV (NMi-VSL).</p><p>Main text.
