    <p>The CCPR K5 key comparison on spectral diffuse reflectance was carried out in the framework of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement, by 13 national metrology institutes (MMIs) as participants.  The participants were CSIR-NML (South Africa), HUT (Finland), IFA-CSIC (Spain), KRISS (Republic of Korea), MSL (New Zealand), NIM (China), NIST (United States of America), NMIJ (Japan), NPL (United Kingdom), NRC (Canada), OMH (Hungary), PTB (Germany) and VNIIOFI (Russia Federation).  NIST (USA) piloted the comparison.</p>
    <p>The aim of this comparison was to check the agreement of measurement of the spectral diffuse reflectance among participants, using the measurement geometry of <italic>d</italic>/0 or 0/<italic>d</italic> in the wavelength range of 360 nm to 820 nm at 20 nm increment.  The comparison was a star type comparison with the samples provided by the pilot laboratory and with the measurement sequence: Pilot–Participant–Pilot.  Spectralon and matte white ceramic tiles were used as the transfer standards.  Each participant received three of each type of sample and at least one sample of each type was measured three times on three separate days, and the other two samples were measured once.</p>
    <p>The report presents the description of the measurement facilities, procedures and uncertainties of all the participants as well as the results of the comparison.  Measurement results from the participants and their associated uncertainties were analyzed in accordance with the Guidelines for CCPR Key Comparison Report Preparation, using weighted mean with cut-off.  For the calculation of the Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV), as agreed by the participants, the data of both samples were used for the 460 nm to 820 nm region and only the data of the Spectralon samples were used in the spectral region of 360 nm to 440 nm.  The unilateral degrees of equivalence (DoE) calculated for each participant are mostly consistent within the uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2) of the DoE.  This international comparison of spectral diffuse reflectance shows overall good agreement among all participants.</p>
