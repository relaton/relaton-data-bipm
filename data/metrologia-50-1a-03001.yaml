    <p>This report presents the results of the COOMET regional key comparison corresponding to CCT-K3 and covering the temperature range from 273.16 K (triple point of water) to 692.77 K (freezing point of Zn). Three National Metrology Institutes, VNIIM (Russian Federation), INSM (the Republic of Moldova) and GEOSTM (Georgia), participated in this regional COOMET comparison. VNIIM was appointed as the pilot laboratory and the coordinator. The link between the regional and key comparisons was provided by VNIIM.</p><p>A platinum resistance thermometer was used as a transported standard. The thermometer calibrated in VNIIM alternately was transferred to INSM and GEOSTM. After measurements in each of these NMIs the thermometer came back to VNIIM and was calibrated for control of its stability.</p><p>The report contains the results of this comparison and detailed information about the method of estimation of the degrees of equivalence of the standards of the participating laboratories and their uncertainties.</p><p>The degrees of equivalence of the national standards that took part in the regional COOMET.T-K3.2 comparison were determined relative to the average reference value of the CCT-K3 comparison. The results of measurements obtained by VNIIM in the CCT-K3 and COOMET.T-K3.2 comparisons were used for this purpose.</p><p>Main text.
