- content: |-
    <p>A bilateral comparison has been organized between VSL, The Netherlands, and BIM, Bulgaria, of the realisations of the international temperature scale ITS-90 at the fixed points of Hg, H<sub>2</sub>O, Ga, In, Sn and Zn using a long-stem SPRT of very good stability as the transfer device. This comparison is registered as EURAMET project T-K3.1 in the BIPM key comparison database and its results are linked to those of key comparison  CCT-K3.</p><p>This comparison was organized in the framework of Phare project BG 2005/017-353.02.02, Lot 1, and is in this framework financed by the EU. This project ran from March 2008 to the end of February 2009.</p><p>For all points of the measurements, a good agreement between the results obtained by BIM and in CCT-K3 could be demonstrated.</p><p>Main text.
