abstract:
- content: "<p>A regional supplementary intercomparison, APMP.T-S5, of Au/Pt thermocouples
    using ITS-90 fixed points from 0 °C to 960 °C was carried out, involving six National
    Metrology Institutes from the Asia-Pacific region: NMIA, SCL, NMIJ, KRISS, NMC
    and NMISA. This is a round robin comparison with two Au/Pt thermocouples designed
    by the pilot lab (NMIA). Both of these thermocouples were calibrated by the pilot
    lab twice: initially and finally at the end of circulating among other participating
    laboratories.</p><p>Reference values computed using the simple mean, median and
    weighted mean were mutually consistent, but since the Birge ratio criterion was
    safely satisfied, the weighted mean was adopted, achieving a  k  = 2 uncertainty
    for the reference value ranging from 10 mK to 16 mK. The thermocouple inhomogeneity,
    which is the dominant component of the calibration, was measured by the pilot
    lab twice: initially and at the end of all measurements. The participating labs
    were asked to supply the temperature profile of the furnaces used to realize the
    fixed point calibrations. These data were convolved with the measured thermocouple
    inhomogeneity to estimate the systematic error in the temperature difference measured
    between the participants, due to the different temperature gradient of the furnaces.
    With this analysis, the uncertainty component due to the inhomogeneity was reduced
    from ±0.004% to below ±0.0015% and consequently allowed some participating laboratories
    to demonstrate agreement with the reference value to within an uncertainty of
    16 mK at the Ag point.</p><p>This paper is the final report of the comparison
    including analysis of the uncertainty of the reference value. This comparison
    demonstrated that the Au/Pt thermocouples can be used to compare the calibration
    capabilities of the laboratories at the 16 mK level at the silver (Ag) point and
    10 mK at the aluminium (Al) point. The results from all laboratories were consistent
    with the reference value within the participants' stated uncertainties.</p><p>
