- content: |-
    <p>A regional supplementary intercomparison, APMP.T-S5, of Au/Pt thermocouples using ITS-90 fixed points from 0 °C to 960 °C was carried out, involving six National Metrology Institutes from the Asia-Pacific region: NMIA, SCL, NMIJ, KRISS, NMC and NMISA. This is a round robin comparison with two Au/Pt thermocouples designed by the pilot lab (NMIA). Both of these thermocouples were calibrated by the pilot lab twice: initially and finally at the end of circulating among other participating laboratories.</p><p>Reference values computed using the simple mean, median and weighted mean were mutually consistent, but since the Birge ratio criterion was safely satisfied, the weighted mean was adopted, achieving a k = 2 uncertainty for the reference value ranging from 10 mK to 16 mK. The thermocouple inhomogeneity, which is the dominant component of the calibration, was measured by the pilot lab twice: initially and at the end of all measurements. The participating labs were asked to supply the temperature profile of the furnaces used to realize the fixed point calibrations. These data were convolved with the measured thermocouple inhomogeneity to estimate the systematic error in the temperature difference measured between the participants, due to the different temperature gradient of the furnaces. With this analysis, the uncertainty component due to the inhomogeneity was reduced from ±0.004% to below ±0.0015% and consequently allowed some participating laboratories to demonstrate agreement with the reference value to within an uncertainty of 16 mK at the Ag point.</p><p>This paper is the final report of the comparison including analysis of the uncertainty of the reference value. This comparison demonstrated that the Au/Pt thermocouples can be used to compare the calibration capabilities of the laboratories at the 16 mK level at the silver (Ag) point and 10 mK at the aluminium (Al) point. The results from all laboratories were consistent with the reference value within the participants' stated uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.
