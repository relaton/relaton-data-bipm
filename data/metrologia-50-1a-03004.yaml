    <p>This is the final report of key comparison EURAMET.T-K7.1, a bilateral comparison of water triple point cells between the Czech Metrology Institute, CMI, and the Slovensky Metrologicky Ustav, SMU, of Slovakia. The comparison was requested by CMI, and the measurement protocol was compatible with the one used for key comparison EUROMET.T-K7. The results show a satisfactory degree of equivalence between SMU and CMI, and allow linkage to the parent key comparison EUROMET.T-K7. As a consequence, CMI is able to support CMCs at the temperature of the triple point of water and submit them for publication in the KCDB.</p><p>Main text.
