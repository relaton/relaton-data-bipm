abstract:
- content: "<p>This is the final report on the Euramet RMO extension of Key Comparison
    5 entitled 'Comparison of local realizations of the ITS-90 between silver point
    and 1700 °C using vacuum tungsten strip lamps as transfer standards'. The local
    realizations in this range of the ITS-90 and the corresponding uncertainties are
    given for the eight national metrology institutes who participated in the comparison.
    The deviations of the participants' data from the previously established and accepted
    CCT-K5 key comparison reference values (KCRV) are presented in this report. For
    some temperature scale, significant unresolved deviations (SUDs) are observed
    between the participants' data and the KCRV. These SUDs are briefly discussed
    in this report. The interlaboratory cross-equivalence values for the different
    temperature realizations are also provided in this report. Prior to the finalization
    of this report, the draft A was presented to the participants for their comments
    and approval. Some minor comments received from the participants were included
    in the draft B. The draft B was approved by all participants for submission to
    the Euramet RMO for further review by the CCT-WG7 working group. The comments
    received from the reviewers of the draft B are incorporated in this final report.
    This final report has been officially approved by the chairman of the CCT-WG7.</p><p>
