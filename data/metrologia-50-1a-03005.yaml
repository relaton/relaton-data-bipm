    <p>This is the final report on the Euramet RMO extension of Key Comparison 5 entitled 'Comparison of local realizations of the ITS-90 between silver point and 1700 °C using vacuum tungsten strip lamps as transfer standards'. The local realizations in this range of the ITS-90 and the corresponding uncertainties are given for the eight national metrology institutes who participated in the comparison. The deviations of the participants' data from the previously established and accepted CCT-K5 key comparison reference values (KCRV) are presented in this report. For some temperature scale, significant unresolved deviations (SUDs) are observed between the participants' data and the KCRV. These SUDs are briefly discussed in this report. The interlaboratory cross-equivalence values for the different temperature realizations are also provided in this report. Prior to the finalization of this report, the draft A was presented to the participants for their comments and approval. Some minor comments received from the participants were included in the draft B. The draft B was approved by all participants for submission to the Euramet RMO for further review by the CCT-WG7 working group. The comments received from the reviewers of the draft B are incorporated in this final report. This final report has been officially approved by the chairman of the CCT-WG7.</p>
