    <p>This report presents the results of the COOMET regional key comparison corresponding to CCT-K3 and covering the temperature range from 273.16 K (triple point of water) to 692.77 K (freezing point of Zn). Two national metrology institutes, the VNIIM (Russian Federation) and the National Scientific Center 'Institute for Metrology' (Ukraine), participated in this regional COOMET comparison. The VNIIM was appointed as the pilot laboratory and the coordinator of the comparison. The link between the regional and key comparisons was provided by VNIIM.</p><p>One platinum resistance thermometer was used as transportable standard. The thermometer calibrated in VNIIM was transferred to the National Scientific Center 'Institute for Metrology'. After measurements at the National Scientific Center 'Institute for Metrology' the thermometer came back to VNIIM and was calibrated for control of its stability.</p><p>The report contains the results of this comparison and detailed information about the method of estimation of the degrees of equivalence of the standards of the participating laboratories and their uncertainties.</p><p>The degrees of equivalence of the national standards that took part in the regional comparison COOMET.T-K3.1 were determined relative to the average reference value of the comparison CCT-K3. The results of measurements carried out by VNIIM in comparisons CCT-K3 and COOMET.T-K3.1 were used for this purpose.</p><p>This report supersedes item 03001 in the Technical Supplement of 2010.</p><p>Main text.
