    <p>The comparison APMP.T-K4 is the regional extension of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/39/1A/6/">CCT-K4</ext-link>: an intercomparison of the realizations of the freezing-points of Al (660.323 °C) and Ag (961.78 °C). The comparison was organized in two loops and four sub-loops with high temperature standard platinum resistance thermometers (HTSPRTs) as transfer thermometers in the freezing-point comparisons. The comparison involved eight APMP NMIs (KRISS, NMIJ, SCL, NMC, CMS, NIMT, SIRIM, NPL), and KRISS and NMIJ acted as linking laboratories to the CCT-K4.</p>
    <p>The transfer HTSPRTs showed a strong drift during the transportation between the NMIs. In the case of the Ag freezing-point comparison, the comparison results were scattered much more than expected. In the APMP meeting held in 2009, the participants agreed that the Ag comparison results would be omitted in the report. It revealed that the measurement results at the Al freezing-point of participants were in agreement with the key comparison reference value of the CCT-K4 within 4 mK except for one laboratory. Details of the comparison results, the uncertainty evaluation and the drift of the HTSPRTs are described in this report.</p>
