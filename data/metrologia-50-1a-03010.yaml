    <p>The aim of this paper is to describe a bilateral comparison carried out by the hygrometry laboratories of the National Metrological Institutes of Brazil and Argentina, INMETRO and INTI, respectively. This comparison was planned and carried out as an informal comparison. But, in view of the lack of and the need for humidity comparison reports in the region of the Inter American Metrology System (SIM), we decided to register this comparison as a bilateral key comparison of the regional metrology organization (RMO), SIM.T-K6.4–INMETRO/INTI. The comparison was performed in the range from −20 ºC to +60 ºC dew/frost point temperatures in 20 °C steps. This paper presents the calibration methods of the laboratories, the uncertainty analysis and the comparison results. The measurements results of the comparison are also presented in terms of the normalised error (E<sub>n</sub>) as a function of the dew/frost point temperature.</p><p>Main text.
