    <p>The results of the APMP key comparison on calibration of gauge blocks by interferometry (APMP.L-K1.1.2011) are reported. This comparison is bilateral between KIM-LIPI and NMIJ and used a similar set of steel gauge blocks ranging from 0.5 mm to 100 mm in length as APMP.L-K1.1. The results are analyzed using E<sub>n</sub> numbers with weighted mean values as the reference values. The agreement between the laboratories is well within the expanded uncertainties. However, there are signs of possibilities of latent offset and length-dependent errors. Furthermore, the KIM-LIPI's results on the gauge block of 90 mm showed a strange distribution. Further investigation and comparison with other laboratories are advisable.</p><p>Main text.
