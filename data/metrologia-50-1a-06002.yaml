- content: |-
    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in September 2011. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the NIST and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0039 with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0034. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
