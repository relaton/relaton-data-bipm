  content: "<p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the \nNational
    Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and of the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the
    BIPM in June 2012. The comparison result, expressed as a ratio of the NMIJ and
    the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0012 with a combined standard uncertainty
    of 2.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.</p>\n<p>Taking into account the changes made to the
    BIPM standard, the result of the present comparison agrees within the uncertainties
    with the result of the earlier direct comparison carried out in 2001.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
