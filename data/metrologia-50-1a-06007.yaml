abstract:
- content: "<p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the \nNational
    Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and of the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation protection-level
    beam of the BIPM in June 2012. The comparison result, expressed as a ratio of
    the NMIJ and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9977 with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 2.6 × 10<sup>−3</sup></p><p>Taking into account the changes made
    to the BIPM standard, the result of the present comparison agrees within the uncertainties
    with the result of the direct comparison carried out in 2001.</p><p> Main text.
