    <p>Since 2008, three national metrology institutes have submitted ampoules for the measurement of <sup>134</sup>Cs in the International Reference System (SIR). The values of the activity submitted were between about 0.17 MBq and 2.3 MBq. The primary standardization result for the IRA, Switzerland, replaces their earlier result of 1978 but no change is proposed for the key comparison reference value at the present time. There are now 14 results in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-134 comparison.</p>
