- content: |-
    <p>In 2012, the fourth comparison of activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the Chinese National Institute of Metrology (NIM). An ampoule containing about 70 kBq of<sup>99m</sup>Tc traceable to the NIM primary standard was measured in the SIRTI for more than three half-lives. The comparison, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m, is linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparison and the degrees of equivalence with the key comparison reference value and between the present NIM result, the other K4 participant and the six participants in the K1 comparison have been evaluated.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
