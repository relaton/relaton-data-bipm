    <p>The APMP.RI(I)-K1 key comparison of the measurement standards of air kerma for <sup>60</sup>Co gamma-rays was undertaken by the APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group between 2004 and 2006, coordinated by the Korean Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS).  In total, 10 institutes took part in the comparison, among which 7 were APMP member laboratories. Three Farmer-type commercial cavity chambers were used as transfer chambers and circulated among the participants. All the participants carried out their measurements according to the guidelines for the comparison established by the KRISS with the cooperation of the ARPANSA.  For each transfer chamber, an NMI calibration coefficient was obtained and a ratio derived by dividing by the average result from the linking laboratories, ARPANSA and NMIJ. The APMP comparison reference value for each chamber was calculated as the mean of the NMI-determined calibration coefficients divided by the average result from the linking laboratories. The results showed that the maximum difference between the APMP linked ratio of a participating NMI and the APMP reference value was 1.76%.</p>
    <p>The measured ratios of the calibration coefficient <italic>R</italic><sub>NMI, BIPM</sub> between the participating NMI and the BIPM via the link laboratories for the transfer chambers were obtained. The maximum expanded uncertainty of <italic>R</italic><sub>NMI, BIPM</sub> for any participating laboratory was 2.0%.</p>
    <p>The degree of equivalence of each participating laboratory with respect to the key comparison reference value was also evaluated.  The expanded uncertainty of the difference between the results ranged from 0.5% to 1.2%.  The pair-wise degree of equivalence between each pair of laboratories was also obtained and the largest difference of the expanded uncertainty of the difference for any pair-wise degree of equivalence was within the expanded uncertainty of the measurement for the pair of laboratories.</p>
