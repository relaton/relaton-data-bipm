- content: |-
    <p>The COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Eu-152 comparison of  measurements of a standardized solution of Eu-152 has enabled the demonstration of the traceability to the SI of the national measurement standards of three national metrology institutes of the COOMET countries: BelGIM, CENTIS-DMR and SMU. The pilot laboratory is the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), which participated in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Eu-152 key comparison and will provide the link to evaluate the degrees of equivalence for these institutes.</p><p>Main text.
