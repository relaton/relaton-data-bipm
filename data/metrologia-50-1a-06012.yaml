    <p>The COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Eu-152 comparison of measurements of a standardized solution of Eu-152 has enabled the demonstration of the traceability to the SI of the national measurement standards of three national metrology institutes of the COOMET countries: BelGIM, CENTIS-DMR and SMU. The pilot laboratory is the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), which participated in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Eu-152 key comparison and will provide the link to evaluate the degrees of equivalence for these institutes.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
