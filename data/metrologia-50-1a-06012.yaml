    <p>The COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Eu-152 comparison of  measurements of a standardized solution of Eu-152 has enabled the demonstration of the traceability to the SI of the national measurement standards of three national metrology institutes of the COOMET countries: BelGIM, CENTIS-DMR and SMU. The pilot laboratory is the D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM), which participated in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/41/1A/06003">BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Eu-152</ext-link> key comparison and will provide the link to evaluate the degrees of equivalence for these institutes.</p>
