    <p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the VNIIM and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams in the range from 25 kV to 35 kV, using two thin-window parallel-plate ionization chambers as transfer instruments. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the expanded uncertainty of 4.8 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are also analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
