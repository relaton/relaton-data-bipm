    <p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the VNIIM and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams in the range from 25 kV to 35 kV, using two thin-window parallel-plate ionization chambers as transfer instruments. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the expanded uncertainty of 4.8 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are also analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
