abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Since 2007, four national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted four samples of known activity of<sup>137</sup>Cs to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-137. The values of the activity submitted were between about 1.4 MBq and 3.6 MBq. The results for the IFIN-HH, Romania, the NMISA, South Africa and the BEV, Austria, replace their earlier results in the key comparison database (KCDB). There are now fourteen results in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-137 comparison to which three results of the COOMET.RI(II)-K2.Cs-137 are linked through the VNIIM, Russia, who participated in both comparisons. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the revised key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table and a graph, together with those of the previous participants.</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
