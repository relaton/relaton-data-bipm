abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The basis for the degrees of equivalence of national primary standards for absorbed dose to water in accelerator photon beams established by the BIPM.RI(I)-K6 comparison was adopted by the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation in May 2013.</p><p>The degrees of equivalence for the comparisons with reports published or having reached a draft B stage before the adoption in May 2013 have been determined and are presented. Comparison reports published after that date will each contain the established degrees of equivalence including those for the new comparison.</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
