    <p>The basis for the degrees of equivalence of national primary standards for absorbed dose to water in accelerator photon beams established by the BIPM.RI(I)-K6 comparison was adopted by the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation in May 2013.</p>
    <p>The degrees of equivalence for the comparisons with reports published or having reached a draft B stage before the adoption in May 2013 have been determined and are presented. Comparison reports published after that date will each contain the established degrees of equivalence including those for the new comparison.</p>
