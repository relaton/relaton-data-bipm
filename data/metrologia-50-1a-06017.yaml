abstract:
- content: "<p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the \nInstituto
    Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares (ININ), Mexico, and of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam
    of the BIPM in 2012. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the ININ and
    the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0035 with a combined standard uncertainty
    of 2.1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees
    of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.\nTo

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
