    <p>An indirect comparison has been made of the standards for absorbed dose to water in <sup>60</sup>Co radiation of the Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais–Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (LNE–LNHB), France and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The measurements at the BIPM were carried out in April 2013. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the LNE–LNHB and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9971 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.9 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
