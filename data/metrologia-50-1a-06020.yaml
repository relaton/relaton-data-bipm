    <p>An international key comparison of<sup>177</sup>Lu was performed in 2009, with identifier CCRI(II)-K2.Lu-177. A total of twelve laboratories performed assays for radioactivity content on aliquots of a common master solution of<sup>177</sup>Lu, leading to eleven results submitted for entry into the Key Comparison Database. A proposed Comparison Reference Value was calculated to be 3.288(5) MBq g<sup>−1</sup> using all eleven results. Preliminary degrees of equivalence were calculated for each reporting laboratory based on the Comparison Reference Value. The Key Comparison Reference Value and final degrees of equivalence will be calculated from the data contained herein and data from measurements made in the International Reference System (SIR) held at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM).</p><p>Main text.
