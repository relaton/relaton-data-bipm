    <p>Since 2009, four national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted four samples of known activity of <sup>64</sup>Cu to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64. The values of the activity submitted were between about 3 MBq and 260 MBq. There are now five results in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64 comparison. A key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been calculated for the first time for this nuclide. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
