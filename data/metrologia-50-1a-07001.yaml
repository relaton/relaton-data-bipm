    <p>Quantitative leak tests with vacuum technology have become an important tool in industry for safety and operational reasons and to meet environmental regulations. In the absence of a relevant key comparison, so far, there are no calibration measurement capabilities published in the BIPM data base. To enable national metrology institutes providing service for leak rate calibrations to apply for these entries in the data base and to ensure international equivalence in this field, key comparison CCM.P-K12 was organized. The goal of this comparison was to compare the national calibration standards and procedures for helium leak rates. Two helium permeation leak elements of 4×10<sup>−11</sup> mol/s (L1) and 8×10<sup>−14</sup> mol/s (L2) served as transfer standards and were measured by 11 national metrology institutes for L1 and 6 national metrology institutes for L2. Equivalence could be shown for 8 laboratories in the case of L1 and for all 6 in the case of L2. Three different evaluation methods were applied and are presented in this report, but the random effects model was accepted as most suitable in our case.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
