    <p>The Euramet comparison No. 1046 is a supplementary comparison of European national water flow laboratories. The comparison started in May 2008 and the measurements were finished in June 2009. Eleven laboratories took part in the comparison—namely: Austria (BEV), Bosnia and Herzegovina (IMBH), Czech Republic (CMI – pilot laboratory), France (CETIAT), Greece (EIM), Hungary (MKEH), Lithuania (VMT/LEI), Republic of Macedonia (BoM), Norway (Justervesenet), Slovakia (SMU) and Switzerland (METAS). Two electromagnetic flow-meters were used as transfer standards. Laboratories' results were compared in a range of flow-rates between 1 m<sup>3</sup>/h and 10 m<sup>3</sup>/h with water at a temperature near to 20 °C. The data were evaluated according to standard methods.</p><p>Main text.
