    <p>This report provides the results of the supplementary bilateral comparison APMP.M.P-S3 between NMI Australia (NMIA) and INRIM, Italy executed from November 2010 to November 2011. NMIA acted as the pilot laboratory and provided a Ruska G series piston gauge as the transfer standard, with a nominal area 16.8 mm<sup>2</sup> requiring a nominal load of 12 kg to balance a pressure of 7.0 MPa. The purpose of this supplementary bilateral comparison was to provide data for linking NMIA to CCM.P-K1.c in the pressure range greater than 4 MPa to extend the range covered by key comparison APMP.M.P-K1c. The original protocol called for the pressure range from 80 kPa to 6.80 MPa. Both participants agreed to limit this comparison range to 1.77 MPa to 6.50 MPa.</p><p>Main text.
