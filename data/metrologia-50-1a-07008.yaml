    <p>This report describes a COOMET key comparison on Vickers hardness scales of two National Metrology Institutesâ€”PTB and VNIIFTRI. The pilot laboratory was PTB, which was the linking institute with the key comparison reference values of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/43/1A/07010/">CCM.H-K1</ext-link>. In the key comparison two sets of hardness reference blocks for the Vickers hardness scales HV1 and HV30, each consisting of three hardness reference blocks with the hardness levels 240 HV, 540 HV and 840 HV, are used. The same hardness reference blocks were used previously in the key comparison CCM.H-K1. The measurement results and uncertainty assessments, announced by VNIIFTRI, are in good agreement with the key comparison reference values of CCM.H-K1.</p>
