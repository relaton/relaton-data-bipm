    <p>This report describes the results of the bilateral comparison EURAMET.M.M-S4 (EURAMET 1232) between the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM, Italy) and the Malta Competition and Consumer Affairs Authority (MCCAA, Malta).</p>
    <p>The results of the comparison will be used to support the Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) declaration of MCCAA in the field of mass standards calibration.</p>
    <p>INRIM was the pilot laboratory for this bilateral comparison. For this comparison the travelling standards were nine mass standards having the following nominal values: 50 kg, 5 kg, 1 kg, 200 g, 50 g, 5 g, 500 mg, 100 mg and 2 mg.</p>
