    <p>The national metrology institutes of Ukraine, Slovakia, Lithuania and Russia conducted a comparison in gas flow from 4 m<sup>3</sup>/h to 160 m<sup>3</sup>/h using a positive displacement flow meter as the transfer device. The participants' flow standards are described. The uncertainty contributed to the comparison by the transfer device (0.13%) was assessed by calibrations performed in the pilot laboratory at the beginning and end of the comparison. The standardized degrees of equivalence between each participant's results and the comparison reference values were less than unity except for one flow measurement at one lab where it was 1.07, demonstrating agreement within uncertainty expectations between the participants.</p><p>Main text.
