abstract:
- content: "<p>The EURAMET comparison no. 1157 is a supplementary comparison of European
    national volume laboratories. The comparison started in September 2010 and the
    measurements were finished in August 2012. Twelve laboratories took part in the
    comparison. The aim of this project was to compare results and method calibration
    of a 1000 L proving tank. The results were quite satisfactory. The majority of
    the laboratories present results that are consistent with the reference value,
    and with each other. The presented uncertainties for the volumetric method are
    in all cases larger than the uncertainties of the gravimetric method, as expected,
    because it is a secondary calibration method.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the
    main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that this text is that which
    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by EURAMET, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
