    <p>The EURAMET comparison no. 1157 is a supplementary comparison of European national volume laboratories. The comparison started in September 2010 and the measurements were finished in August 2012. Twelve laboratories took part in the comparison. The aim of this project was to compare results and method calibration of a 1000 L proving tank. The results were quite satisfactory. The majority of the laboratories present results that are consistent with the reference value, and with each other. The presented uncertainties for the volumetric method are in all cases larger than the uncertainties of the gravimetric method, as expected, because it is a secondary calibration method.</p>
