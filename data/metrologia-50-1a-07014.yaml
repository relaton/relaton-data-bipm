    <p>This report presents the final results of supplementary comparison SIM.M.P-S7 in the field of hydraulic pressure up to 70 MPa, within the PTB-ANDIMET-PLUS project. Seven national pressure reference laboratories participated in this comparison, which started with an opening meeting in November 2011 at the city of Lima; the closing meeting was held at the National Metrology Institute of Colombia INM, at Bogota, on 27–28 November 2012. Each participating laboratory used for the comparison its best hydraulic pressure balance standard in the range from 7 MPa to 70 MPa. The transfer standard for the comparison was a digital manometer DH Instruments Fluke RPM-4 with an accuracy of 0.008% of the reading.</p><p>The reference laboratory and advisor for the comparison was CENAM, Mexico. The comparison protocol and results analysis was made by the pressure laboratory of National Metrology Institute INM (Colombia) who participated in the comparison as well.</p><p>Main text.
