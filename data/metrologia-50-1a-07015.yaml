    <p>This report describes a COOMET key comparison on Vickers hardness scales involving five National Metrology Institutes: PTB (Germany), BelGIM (Belarus), NSC IM (Ukraine), KazInMetr (Kazakhstan) and VNIIFTRI (Russia). The pilot laboratory was VNIIFTRI, and PTB acted as the linking institute to key comparisons CCM.H-K1.b and CCM.H-K1.c  conducted for the Vickers hardness scales HV1 and HV30, respectively.</p>
    <p>The comparison was also conducted for the HV5 Vickers hardness scale, since this scale is most frequently used in practice in Russia and CIS countries that work according to GOST standards.</p>
    <p>In the key comparison, two sets of hardness reference blocks for the Vickers hardness scales HV1, HV5 and HV30 consisting each of three hardness reference blocks with hardness levels of 450 HV and 750 HV were used. The measurement results and uncertainty assessments for HV1 and HV30 hardness scales, as announced by BelGIM, NSC IM, KazInMetr and VNIIFTRI, are in good agreement with the key comparison reference values of CCM.H-K1.b and CCM.H-K1.c. The comparison results for the HV5 hardness scale are viewed as additional information, since up to today no CCM key comparisons on this scale have yet been carried out.</p>
