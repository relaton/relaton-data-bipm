abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>From October 2009 to November 2010 a star-shaped comparison in mass measurements was carried out between CARIMET countries. The Bureau of Standards Jamaica (BSJ) acted as the pilot laboratory.</p><p>Six travelling standards were circulated with the following nominal values: 2 kg, 1 kg, 200 g, 50 g, 1 g and 200 mg. These travelling standards complied with the accuracy requirements of OIML class E2. The results of the intercomparison are presented here.</p><p>In general, the agreement between all participants is very good, except for the 50 g weight where one laboratory clearly made an outlier measurement.</p><p>Main text.
