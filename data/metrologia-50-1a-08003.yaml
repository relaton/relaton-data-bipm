abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K89 was undertaken to demonstrate the capability of participating NMIs and DIs in measuring the contents of incurred trace elements (total arsenic, cadmium and lead) and essential elements (calcium and zinc) at µg/g (for arsenic, cadmium, lead and zinc) and mg/g (for calcium) levels in a herb matrix sample by various analytical techniques.</p><p>This key comparison was organized by the Government Laboratory of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (GLHK) and agreed at the Inorganic Analysis Working Group Meeting in Hindås, Sweden in October 2010 as a benchmarking exercise with arsenic (a trace element) and calcium (an essential element) chosen as the 'exemplary' elements. It was also agreed that a pilot study CCQM-P126 would be run in parallel with this key comparison.</p><p>The key comparison serves to facilitate claims by participants on the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) as listed in Appendix C of the Key Comparison Database (KCDB) under the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM MRA).</p><p>A total of 20 NMIs/DIs registered for this programme and 18 of them submitted their results. Most of the participants used microwave acid digestion methods for sample dissolution. For the instrumental determination, a variety of techniques like ICP-MS, AAS, INAA, ICP-AES were employed by the participants. For this key comparison, inorganic core capabilities have been demonstrated by concerned participants with respect to methods including ICP-MS (without isotope dilution), ID-ICP-MS, ICP-AES, INAA, AAS and ion chromatography with iteratively matrix-matched calibration on the determination of total arsenic, calcium, cadmium, lead and zinc in a matrix of herb.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
