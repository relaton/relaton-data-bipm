    <p>The supplementary comparison APMP.QM-S5 was undertaken to demonstrate the capability of participating national metrology institutes (NMIs) and designated institutes (DIs) in measuring the contents of the incurred essential elements (iron and zinc) and toxic elements (total arsenic and cadmium) at Âµg/g levels in a test sample of dried shrimp by various analytical techniques.</p>
    <p>At the APMP TCQM Meeting held in Pattaya, Thailand in November 2010, Government Laboratory of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (GLHK) proposed this APMP supplementary comparison. The proposal was further discussed and agreed upon at the CCQM Inorganic Analysis Working Group Meeting held in Paris in April 2011. GLHK was the coordinating laboratory for the supplementary comparison. For enhancing the collaboration amongst specialized regional bodies in Asia-Pacific and to help build the laboratory capacity of NMIs/DIs from developing economies, the reference values of the supplementary comparison are used for evaluation of performance of participants of an APMP proficiency testing programme (APMP PT 11-01), an Asia-Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation proficiency testing programme (APLAC T082) and an Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation proficiency testing programme (APEC PT), which were concurrently run using the same testing material as in APMP.QM-S5.</p>
    <p>The supplementary comparison serves to facilitate claims by participants on the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) as listed in Appendix C of the Key Comparison Database (KCDB) under the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM MRA).</p>
    <p>A total of 18 institutes registered for the supplementary comparison and all of them submitted their results. Most of the participants used microwave acid digestion methods for sample dissolution. For the instrumental determination, a variety of techniques like ICP-MS, ICP-OES, INAA and AAS were employed by the participants. For this supplementary comparison, inorganic core capabilities have been demonstrated by concerned participants with respect to methods including ICP-MS (without isotope dilution), ID-ICP-MS, ICP-OES, INAA and AAS on the determination of total arsenic, cadmium, iron and zinc in a matrix of seafood.</p>
