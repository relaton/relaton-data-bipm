    <p>The 2010 CCQM-K79 'Comparison of value-assigned CRMs and PT materials: Ethanol in aqueous media' is the second key comparison directly testing the chemical measurement services provided to customers by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs). CCQM-K79 compared the assigned ethanol values of proficiency test (PT) and certified reference materials (CRMs) using measurements made on these materials under repeatability conditions. Nine NMIs submitted 27 CRM or value-assigned PT materials for evaluation. These materials represent many of the higher-order reference materials then available for this commercially and forensically important measurand.</p><p>The assigned ethanol mass fraction in the materials ranged from 0.1 mg/kg to 334 mg/kg. All materials were stored and prepared according the specifications provided by each NMI. Samples were processed and analyzed under repeatability conditions by one analytical team using a gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) method of demonstrated trueness and precision.</p><p>Given the number of materials and the time required for each analysis, the majority of the measurements were made in two measurement campaigns ('runs'). Due to a shipping delay from one NMI, an unanticipated third campaign was required. In all three campaigns, replicate analyses (three injections of one preparation separated in time) were made for one randomly selected unit of each of the 27 materials. Nine of the 27 materials were gravimetrically diluted before measurement to provide solutions with ethanol mass fraction in the established linear range of the GC-FID method. The repeatability measurement value for each analyzed solution was estimated as the mean of all replicate values. The within- and between-campaign variance components were estimated using one-way ANOVA. Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian analysis was used to estimate 95% level-of-confidence coverage intervals for the mean values.</p><p>Uncertainty-weighted generalized distance regression was used to establish the key comparison reference function (KCRF) relating the assigned values to the repeatability measurements. On the basis of leave-one-out cross-validation, all of the assigned values for all 27 materials were deemed equivalent at the 95% level of confidence. These materials were used to define the KCRF.</p><p>Parametric bootstrap Monte Carlo was used to estimate 95% level-of-confidence coverage intervals for the degrees of equivalence of materials, d ± U<sub>95</sub>(d), and of the participating NMIs, D ± U<sub>95</sub>(D). Because of the very wide range of ethanol mass fraction in the materials, these degrees of equivalence are expressed in percent relative form: %d ± U<sub>95</sub>(%d) and %D ± U<sub>95</sub>(%D). The median of the absolute values of the %D for the participating NMIs is less than 0.05% with a median U<sub>95</sub>(%D) of less than 1%. These results demonstrate that the participating NMIs have the ability to correctly value-assign CRMs and proficiency test materials for ethanol in aqueous media and similar measurands.</p><p>Main text.
