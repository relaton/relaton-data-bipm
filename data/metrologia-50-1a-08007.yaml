- content: |-
    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K30.1 was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of CCQM to test the abilities of the National Metrology Institutes to measure the mass fraction of lead in wine. CMQ-Fundacion Chile acted as the coordinating laboratory. Twelve institutes registered to participate in the key comparison but only eleven submitted results. One of these agreed that its result should not be included in the key comparison reference value and another indicated after completion of the study that it had recalculated its uncertainty. The participants used different measurement methods, though the most common was isotope-dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS). Accounting for the achieved uncertainty, comparability of measurement results was successfully demonstrated by the majority of participating NMIs for this measurement. Participants were also asked to indicate the core capabilities required for their measurements and these are summarized in the report. This comparison may be directly used to support CMCs for lead in wine and indirectly by institutes wishing to support appropriate CMCs via the core capability route.</p><p>Main text.
