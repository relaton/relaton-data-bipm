abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K96 was organized jointly by the inorganic and electrochemistry working groups of CCQM to test the abilities of the metrology institutes to measure the amount content of dichromate. Slovak Institute of Metrology with help of KRISS acted as the coordinating laboratories. Eight NMIs took part in the comparison. All participants used high accuracy constant current coulometry. Good agreement of the results was observed.</p><p>Main text.
