- content: |-
    <p>The aim of the key comparison CCQM-K92 was to demonstrate the capabilities of the participating NMIs to measure electrolytic conductivity of an unknown sample.</p><p>Two samples with nominal electrolytic conductivity values of 0.05 S m<sup>−1</sup> and 20 S m<sup>−1</sup> have been prepared for comparison. For the first time a conductivity value larger than those given in the IUPAC document [1] was measured in a CCQM comparison. Thus no calibration standards with similar conductivity value were available. The comparison was an activity of the Electrochemical Working Group (EAWG) of the CCQM and was coordinated by SMU.</p><p>In the comparison NMIs from fifteen countries took part. The higher conductivity (20 S m<sup>−1</sup>) was measured by ten participants. Good agreement of the results was observed for the majority of participants.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
