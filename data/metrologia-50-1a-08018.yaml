    <p>Under the auspices of the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a key comparison, CCQM-K81 'Chloramphenicol in pig muscle', was coordinated by BVL and PTB in 2009/2010. Six NMIs/DIs participated in this comparison.</p>
    <p>Chloramphenicol (CAP) is an effective broad-spectrum antibiotic which can in principle be used for the treatment of humans and animals. Its use for the treatment of food-producing animals is, however, forbidden worldwide in many countries due to potential severe side effects. The key comparison was the follow-up to the successful pilot study 'CCQM-P90: chloramphenicol in milk'. With this key comparison it was intended to demonstrate the capability of NMIs/DIs to analyse traces of CAP in food at concentration levels resulting from legal requirements for food control. Additionally, the quality of this kind of analysis with respect to compliance with legal requirements for food control methods and the international comparability of measurements should be evaluated in general. The study was classified as a 'track C' study (studies in emerging areas of global interest).</p>
    <p>For the study incurred lyophilised pig muscle material containing CAP (at a mass-fraction level around the maximum allowable level for import for a number of countries) has been produced as a candidate reference material by BVL and IRMM (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, JRC of the European Commission). Animal treatment and slaughtering of the animal to gain incurred muscle material as well as pre-testing of the CAP content was done at the BVL. The IRMM did further processing of the material and testing of homogeneity and stability. Participants were invited to assign the mass fraction of free CAP in the comparison sample.</p>
    <p>CCQM-K81 demonstrated successfully the capability of the participating laboratories to assign chloramphenicol values in tissue down to residue levels of around 0.3 ng/g (referring to the analyte content in reconstituted muscle material). Although very different sample preparation techniques (different pre-treatments, defattening steps, cartridges, solvents) as well as different analytical techniques (LC-MSMS, GC-MS, different instruments, columns, eluents) were applied to detect chloramphenicol at a very low concentration level, a KCRV of 0.267 ng/g with a satisfying expanded uncertainty of 17.4% was ascertained. Two of the reported results were not eligible to be used in establishing the KCRV; anyhow the KCRV as estimated from just the eligible results agrees very well with the additional results.</p>
    <p>With respect to legal requirements for quantitative methods for residue control in food the key comparison results prove the capabilities of the laboratories to fulfil these settings with highest precision and to provide calibration and measurement services to residue control laboratories.</p>
