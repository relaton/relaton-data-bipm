    <p>From within AFRIMETS, the Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) for Africa, the RMO Key Comparison AFRIMETS.QM-K27 was coordinated by the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA) in 2011. Ten Metrology Institutes participated, comprising three AFRIMETS, two APMP, four EURAMET and one SIM participant. Participants were required to determine the forensic level concentration of two aqueous ethanol solutions that were gravimetrically prepared by the NMISA. Concentrations were expected to lie in the range of 0.1 mg/g to 5.0 mg/g.</p>
    <p>The accurate determination of ethanol content in aqueous medium is critical for regulatory forensic and trade purposes. The CCQM Organic Analysis Working Group has carried out several key comparisons (CCQM-K27 series) on the determination of ethanol in wine and aqueous matrices. Developing NMIs now had the opportunity to link to the earlier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/41/1A/08002">CCQM-K27</ext-link> studies through the AFRIMETS.QM-K27 study.</p>
    <p>Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionisation or mass spectrometric detection was applied by eight of the participants, while three participants (including NMISA) applied titrimetry for the ethanol assay.</p>
    <p>The assigned reference value of the aqueous ethanol solutions was used to link AFRIMETS.QM-K27 to the CCQM-K27 key comparison reference value. The assigned reference values for AFRIMETS.QM-K27 Level 1 and Level 2 were (0.3249 ± 0.0021) mg/g (<italic>k</italic> = 2) and (4.6649 ± 0.0152) mg/g (<italic>k</italic> = 2), respectively. The reference values were determined using the purity-corrected gravimetric preparation values, while the standard uncertainty incorporated the gravimetric preparation and titrimetric homogeneity uncertainties.</p>
    <p>From previous CCQM-K27 studies, the expected spread (%CV) of higher order measurements of ethanol in aqueous medium is about 0.85% relative. In this study the CV for Level 1 is about 12% (10% with two outliers removed) and for Level 2 about 4%.</p>
    <p>Three of the ten laboratories submitted results within 1.5% of the gravimetric reference value for Level 1; four of the ten participating laboratories submitted mean results within 1.5% of the gravimetric reference value for Level 2. Two of the participating laboratories achieved mean results within 1.5% of the gravimetric reference value for both levels.</p>
    <p>Participants in the AFRIMETS-K27 study would therefore have benefited from a pilot study in which to test their measurement capability prior to participation in the key comparison. Several NMIs, however, will still be able to make new CMC claims based on their performance in this comparison.</p>
