    <p>This report presents the results of CCQM-K93, a key comparison between 13 National Measurement Institutes (NMIs), which tested the capability of the NMIs to prepare standard gas mixtures of ethanol at a nominal amount fraction of 120 µmol/mol in nitrogen. This composition is typical of the levels used to calibrate evidential breath analysers in many countries. Such standards fulfill the agreed requirements of the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) for the calibration of evidential breath-alcohol analysers.</p>
