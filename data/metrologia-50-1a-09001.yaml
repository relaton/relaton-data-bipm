    <p>This is the final report for key comparison APMP.AUV.V-K3 in the area of 'vibration' (quantity of acceleration). The aim of this comparison was to measure the voltage sensitivity of two accelerometer standard sets with primary means at 17 frequencies from 0.5 Hz to 20 Hz. Seven Metrology Institutes from APMP economies have participated in the comparison with National Institute of Metrology, PR China as pilot lab and National Metrology Institute of South Africa as co-pilot lab. Two quartz-flexure servo accelerometers of single-ended type and a signal conditioner were circulated among the participants. The supplementary comparison reference values have been calculated using the weighted mean value of the results. The degrees of equivalence calculated from the data submitted by the seven laboratories support the uncertainty of measurement reported by the seven participants for the calibration of the magnitude of the complex sensitivity of accelerometer, with the only exception of CMS at 3.15 Hz, 4 Hz, 12.5 Hz and 16 Hz. At the reference frequency of 1.6 Hz (specified in ISO 16063-11:1999), the participating laboratories calibrated the transfer standard sets with their claimed relative expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2), the smallest of which is equal to 0.2%, i.e. smaller than the limit specified by the ISO standard.</p>
