    <p>The supplementary Regional Comparison EURAMET.AUV.A-S1 has been carried out under the auspices of EURAMET's Technical Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration, and the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The participating NMIs are the Centro Nacional de Metrolog√≠a (CENAM, Mexico), the Danish Fundamental Metrology (DFM, Denmark) and the Directorate of Measures and Precious Metals (DMDM, Serbia). The role of the Pilot laboratory was jointly undertaken by the DFM and CENAM. The time schedule was organized in a single star configuration. Two LS1P microphones and two LS2aP were circulated among participants. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, and the analysis leading to a proposal for the reference values for the comparison.</p>
