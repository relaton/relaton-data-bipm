    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We measured the absolute frequency of the optical clock transition <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub>(<italic>F</italic> = 1/2)–<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub>(<italic>F</italic> = 1/2) of <sup>171</sup>Yb atoms confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice and it was determined to be 518 295 836 590 863.5(8.1) Hz. The frequency was measured against Terrestrial Time (TT; the SI second on the geoid) using an optical frequency comb of which the frequency was phase-locked to an H-maser as a flywheel oscillator traceable to TT. The magic wavelength was also measured as 394 798.48(79) GHz. The results are in good agreement with two previous measurements of other institutes within the specified uncertainty of this work.</p>
