    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Air kerma is defined in air, the constituents and the amounts of which are determined experimentally with some uncertainties. The inherent uncertainty of air kerma in a photon beam stemming from the uncertainties of atomic weights and composition data in air was evaluated as a function of photon energy. The uncertainty was 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup> for photon beams with energies in the range 1 keV to 20Â MeV.</p>
