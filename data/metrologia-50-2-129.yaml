abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Air kerma is defined in air, the constituents and the amounts
    of which are determined experimentally with some uncertainties. The inherent uncertainty
    of air kerma in a photon beam stemming from the uncertainties of atomic weights
    and composition data in air was evaluated as a function of photon energy. The
    uncertainty was 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup> for photon beams with energies in the
    range 1 keV to 20Â MeV.</p>
