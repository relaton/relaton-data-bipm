abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we present the results of our work concerning
    the long-distance fibre optic dissemination of time (1 PPS) and frequency (10 MHz)
    signals generated by atomic sources, such as caesium clocks, hydrogen masers or
    caesium fountains. For these purposes we developed dedicated hardware (a fibre
    optic system with active stabilization of the propagation delay and bidirectional
    fibre optic amplifiers) together with a procedure to enable calibration of the
    time transfer. Our laboratory measurements performed over fibre lengths of up
    to 480 km showed an Allan deviation of the order of 4 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, time
    deviation below 1 ps (both at one-day averaging) and the possibility of calibration
    with picosecond accuracy even for the longest from evaluated links. After successful
    laboratory evaluation the system was next installed on a 421.4 km long route between
    the Central Office of Measures (GUM) in Warsaw, Poland, and the Astrogeodynamic
    Observatory (AOS) in Borowiec near Poznań, Poland. Experiments comparing the UTC(PL)
    and UTC(AOS) atomic timescales using the fibre optic link and TTS-4 dual-frequency
    GNSS time transfer receivers showed that the consistency of the results is within
    the calibration accuracy of the GPS receivers and with much better noise performance.
    The field operation of the system proved its full functionality and confirmed
    our previous laboratory evaluation to the maximum extent possible using the methods
    for comparing distant clocks available at GUM and AOS.</p>
