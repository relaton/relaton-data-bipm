    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The temperature dependence of the cavity ion chamber response was measured at room temperature in the range 17 °C to 27 °C. By analysing the variation of the ionization current with temperature produced in the cavity chamber, the temperature coefficient of the cavity chamber response was evaluated. The values were 4.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> °C<sup>−1</sup>, 4.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> °C<sup>−1</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> °C<sup>−1</sup> for chambers made of C552 air equivalent plastic, polyoxymethylene and graphite, respectively.</p>
