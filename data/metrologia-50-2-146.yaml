abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The temperature dependence of the cavity ion chamber response
    was measured at room temperature in the range 17 °C to 27 °C. By analysing the
    variation of the ionization current with temperature produced in the cavity chamber,
    the temperature coefficient of the cavity chamber response was evaluated. The
    values were 4.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup> °C<sup>−1</sup>, 4.3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> °C<sup>−1</sup>
    and 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> °C<sup>−1</sup> for chambers made of C552 air equivalent
    plastic, polyoxymethylene and graphite, respectively.</p>
