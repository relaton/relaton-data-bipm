abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Some projects such as the EUROMET project 463 have underlined
    the lack of agreement between experimental measurements and calculations by the
    finite element method (FEM), used to determine the piston fall rate of a high-pressure
    balance used in primary standards. This is significant because the piston fall
    rate is an essential parameter to characterize experimentally the mean gap between
    the piston and the cylinder and to determine the effective area (A<sub>p</sub>)
    at each pressure (p) point. By improving the method used to estimate the piston
    fall rate it is possible to improve the determination of the gap, the effective
    area and consequently the pressure distortion coefficient. One possible cause
    of the lack of agreement between the calculated and measured piston fall rates
    could be inappropriate modelling of the fluid flow. In fact, the former quasi-1D
    Stokes model assimilates the gap between the piston and the cylinder as formed
    by two parallel walls, which is an approximation. In addition, the velocity of
    the piston wall was neglected. In order to evaluate the influence of this model,
    the equations of the fluid flow are modified and are presented in this paper.
    Equations that were defined in a parallel-plane model are defined in an annular
    gap model. In addition to this, corrections due to the velocity of the piston
    wall are inserted. This research work is applied on a Desgranges et Huot DH 7594
    piston–cylinder unit of PTB with a pressure up to 1 GPa, in the continuity of
    the EUROMET project 463 in order to quantify the influence of each correction
    that has been inserted in the new equations. This is carried out using the FEM.
    This analysis will allow us to evaluate the improvement of our knowledge of the
    behaviour of piston gauges and consequently to better evaluate the uncertainties
    due to the models.</p>
