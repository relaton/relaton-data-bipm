abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper is an introduction to the principles developed for
    the application of metrology to the field of chemistry and particularly to analytical
    chemistry. It starts with a discussion of the mole, the base unit of the SI that
    is most relevant to analytical chemistry. The mole has become the subject of particular
    discussion recently, since the publication of proposals to re-define it along
    with three other base units of the SI. This discussion has also generated interest
    in the origin of the term ‘amount of substance’ used as the quantity for which
    the mole is the unit. This paper reviews the origin of this term and explains
    why it is not sufficient to replace it with an alternative such as a ‘number of
    entities’. The paper concludes with some discussion of how the mole is realized
    through the use of primary methods of measurement.</p>
