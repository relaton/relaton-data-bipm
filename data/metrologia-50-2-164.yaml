abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In a watt-balance experiment, separate measurements of magnetic
    force and induced electric potential in a conductor in a magnetic field allow
    for a virtual comparison between mechanical and electrical powers, which leads
    to an accurate measurement of the Planck constant. In this paper, the macroscopic
    equations for the magnetic force and the induced electric potential are re-examined
    from a microscopic point of view and the corrective terms due to a non-uniform
    density of the conduction electrons induced by their interaction with the magnetic
    field are investigated. The results indicate that these corrections are irrelevant
    to the watt-balance operation.</p>
