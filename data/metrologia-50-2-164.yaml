    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In a watt-balance experiment, separate measurements of magnetic force and induced electric potential in a conductor in a magnetic field allow for a virtual comparison between mechanical and electrical powers, which leads to an accurate measurement of the Planck constant. In this paper, the macroscopic equations for the magnetic force and the induced electric potential are re-examined from a microscopic point of view and the corrective terms due to a non-uniform density of the conduction electrons induced by their interaction with the magnetic field are investigated. The results indicate that these corrections are irrelevant to the watt-balance operation.</p>
