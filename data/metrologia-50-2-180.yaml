    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper aims to investigate, by means of numerical simulation, the effect of gap profiles on the calculation of the pressure distortion coefficient (<italic>λ</italic>) and the piston fall rate (<italic>v</italic><sub>f</sub>) of two piston–cylinder units used in a Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais (LNE) 200 MPa pressure balance. The ideal mean gap width between the piston and the cylinder was obtained after measuring the piston fall rate at a low pressure, while the piston radius was obtained from the cross-float experiments at a low pressure. The real gap width was obtained from dimensional measurements by measuring the diameter and straightness of the piston and the cylinder. The piston and cylinder radial distortions were calculated using the finite element method. The pressure distribution in the gap was calculated on the basis of the Navier–Stokes equation for Newtonian viscous flow. The results such as pressure distributions, radial distortions, the pressure distortion coefficient and the piston fall rate were presented for the free-deformation operating mode of the assemblies. The calculation resulted in ideal and real gap profiles indicating that the average pressure distortion coefficient was in good agreement within 0.017 × 10<sup>−6</sup> MPa<sup>−1</sup> and the calculations of piston fall rate depended on the gap profile especially at the inlet and outlet zones of the engagement length.</p>
