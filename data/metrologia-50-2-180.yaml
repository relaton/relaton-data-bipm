abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper aims to investigate, by means of numerical simulation,
    the effect of gap profiles on the calculation of the pressure distortion coefficient
    (λ) and the piston fall rate (v<sub>f</sub>) of two piston–cylinder units used
    in a Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais (LNE) 200 MPa pressure balance.
    The ideal mean gap width between the piston and the cylinder was obtained after
    measuring the piston fall rate at a low pressure, while the piston radius was
    obtained from the cross-float experiments at a low pressure. The real gap width
    was obtained from dimensional measurements by measuring the diameter and straightness
    of the piston and the cylinder. The piston and cylinder radial distortions were
    calculated using the finite element method. The pressure distribution in the gap
    was calculated on the basis of the Navier–Stokes equation for Newtonian viscous
    flow. The results such as pressure distributions, radial distortions, the pressure
    distortion coefficient and the piston fall rate were presented for the free-deformation
    operating mode of the assemblies. The calculation resulted in ideal and real gap
    profiles indicating that the average pressure distortion coefficient was in good
    agreement within 0.017 × 10<sup>−6</sup> MPa<sup>−1</sup> and the calculations
    of piston fall rate depended on the gap profile especially at the inlet and outlet
    zones of the engagement length.</p>
