abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Bandpass correction in spectrometer measurements using monochromators
    is often necessary in order to obtain accurate measurement results. The classical
    approach of spectrometer bandpass correction is based on local polynomial approximations
    and the use of finite differences. Here we compare this approach with an extension
    of the Richardson–Lucy method, which is well known in image processing, but has
    not been applied to spectrum bandpass correction yet. Using an extensive simulation
    study and a practical example, we demonstrate the potential of the Richardson–Lucy
    method. In contrast to the classical approach, it is robust with respect to wavelength
    step size and measurement noise. In almost all cases the Richardson–Lucy method
    turns out to be superior to the classical approach both in terms of spectrum estimate
    and its associated uncertainties.</p>
