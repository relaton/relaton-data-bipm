abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The calibration of laboratory standard microphones by the pressure
    reciprocity method, as specified in IEC 61094-2, is used throughout the world
    as the basis for primary measurement standards for sound pressure. While the method
    has long been used to determine the magnitude of the pressure sensitivity of the
    microphone, the phase sensitivity has until recently been overlooked, and is notable
    by its absence in BIPM's database of CMCs. A new BIPM key comparison is therefore
    addressing this by including phase calibration within its scope, and is the incentive
    for a systematic evaluation of the associated measurement uncertainty. The analysis
    presented is based on the requirements of IEC 61094-2 and makes use of modelling
    and experimentation to determine uncertainty in phase pressure sensitivity for
    type LS1 and type LS2 microphones. Linearity of phase measurement and stray capacitance
    are the dominant electrical components, both acting independently of frequency.
    The most significant acoustic components are the uncertainty in thermal diffusivity
    at low frequencies and microphone parameter uncertainty at high frequencies. Measurement
    repeatability is below the level of the type B evaluation for most of the frequency
    range, but at low frequencies it dominates for both microphone types. For both
    types of microphone the overall measurement uncertainty is estimated to be below
    0.5Â° over the central frequency range.</p>
