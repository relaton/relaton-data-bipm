abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The cosine error of a class of in situ hyperspectral irradiance
    sensors largely applied for ocean colour investigations has been characterized
    for both in-air and in-water measurements. Results for in-air measurements indicate
    a slight wavelength dependence of the cosine error with differences up to 2% in
    the 412 nm to 865 nm spectral interval at 65° zenith angle (i.e. the angle of
    incident irradiance with respect to the normal axis of the irradiance collector).
    However, the dependence of the cosine error on the zenith angle is generally quite
    marked and significantly varies from radiometer to radiometer with values ranging
    from −5% up to +7% at 65°. Additionally, apart from the expected increase in the
    cosine error with the angle of incidence, in-air measurements generally indicate
    an irregular deviation from the ideal cosine response near the normal angle of
    incidence. A more pronounced increase in the cosine error is generally observed
    when radiometers are operated in water with respect to in air.</p>
