abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The National Institute of Information and Communications Technology
    (NICT) has developed and tested carrier-phase two-way satellite time and frequency
    transfer (TWSTFT) as a next-generation technique applicable to greater distances
    and resulting in higher precision. A method different from that used for code-based
    TWSTFT is required for carrier-phase TWSTFT. We propose a new method based on
    variations of carrier phases for the propagation of signals.</p><p>Using the ETS-VIII
    satellite launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the Time
    Comparison Equipment (TCE) system developed by NICT, carrier-phase TWSTFT experiments
    were carried out between two ground-based hydrogen masers separated by a baseline
    of 110 km. Our tests showed that the frequency difference between two hydrogen
    masers can be measured for averaging times larger than 1000 s and the precision
    of carrier-phase TWSTFT is about 100 times better than that of code-based TWSTFT.</p>
