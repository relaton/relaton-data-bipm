abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper investigates the performance of interpolation equations
    for a near infrared thermal imager operating over wavelengths from 0.9 µm to 1.7 µm
    with various filter bandwidths and a broad temperature range from 300 °C to 1000 °C.
    The equations are based on a general formulation of the effective wavelength as
    a function of the temperature. The quality of the interpolation is assessed in
    relation to the order of the effective wavelength. However, the noise induced
    by the imperfections of the thermal imager significantly disturbs the signal,
    and this phenomenon is enhanced as the bandwidth of the filter increases (i.e.
    for low-temperature applications). The main purpose of this paper is to establish
    the right choice of the filter bandwidth and the expression and order of the interpolation
    equation in relation to the noise level on the thermal imager and the desired
    accuracy. This paper first outlines the background on interpolation equations
    and then tests them on synthetic data from signals delivered first by an ideal
    thermal imager (i.e. free from noise) and then from noisy signals. This simulation
    study provides a framework for users to select an interpolation equation with
    an adequate order for near infrared thermal imagers. The performances of the selected
    interpolation equations are finally demonstrated on real images performed by a
    near infrared thermal imager.</p>
