abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This work explores the feasibility of acoustic gas thermometry
    (AGT) in the range 700 K to the copper point (1358 K) in order to more accurately
    measure the differences between ITS-90 and the thermodynamic temperature. To test
    material suitability and stability, we investigated microwave resonances in argon-filled
    cylindrical cavities machined from a Ni–Cr–Fe alloy. We measured the frequencies
    of five non-degenerate microwave modes of one cavity at temperatures up to 1349 K
    using home-made coaxial cables and antennas. The short-term repeatability of both
    the measured frequencies f<sub>N</sub> and the scaled half-widths g<sub>N</sub>/f<sub>N</sub>
    was better than 10<sup>−6</sup> f<sub>N</sub>. Oxidation was not a problem while
    clean argon flowed through the cavity. The measurement techniques are compatible
    with highly accurate AGT and may be adaptable to refractive index gas thermometry.</p>
