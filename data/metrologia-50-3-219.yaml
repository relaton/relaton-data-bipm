    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This work explores the feasibility of acoustic gas thermometry (AGT) in the range 700 K to the copper point (1358 K) in order to more accurately measure the differences between ITS-90 and the thermodynamic temperature. To test material suitability and stability, we investigated microwave resonances in argon-filled cylindrical cavities machined from a Ni–Cr–Fe alloy. We measured the frequencies of five non-degenerate microwave modes of one cavity at temperatures up to 1349 K using home-made coaxial cables and antennas. The short-term repeatability of both the measured frequencies <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> and the scaled half-widths <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>/<italic>f</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub> was better than 10<sup>−6</sup> <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>N</italic></sub>. Oxidation was not a problem while clean argon flowed through the cavity. The measurement techniques are compatible with highly accurate AGT and may be adaptable to refractive index gas thermometry.</p>
