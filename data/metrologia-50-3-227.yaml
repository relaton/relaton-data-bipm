abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The melting temperatures of the eutectic phase transitions of
    cobalt–carbon, platinum–carbon and rhenium–carbon alloys are proposed as reference
    standards for high temperature radiation thermometry. The behaviour of these is
    such that rather than a unique readily identified feature of the melting curve
    being assigned a temperature, upper and lower limits will be given. The lower
    limit will be the point of inflection in the melting curve, a point previously
    identified as unchanging with the rate at which melting takes place. The upper
    limit will be based on an extrapolation of the tangent at the point of inflection.
    The melting curves of cobalt–carbon fixed points are measured and it is found
    that the upper and lower limits converge as the melting rate is reduced. The point
    of inflection appears to have a melting rate dependence while the upper limit
    appears to be much more stable. This may have implications for planned research
    into assignment of thermodynamic temperature to these fixed points.</p>
