abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Establishment of traceability in hardness measurement is still
    under discussion at the ISO TC 164 SC 3 subcommittee on hardness testing. Two
    paths for establishing traceability are proposed for the Rockwell hardness measurement
    in ISO 6508-1. One way is taking a route to SI units through direct calibration
    of machine components, and the other way is taking a route to a hardness measurement
    standard through indirect calibration of machine performance. In addition to this,
    the difference in hardness measurement procedures between Rockwell and Brinell/Vickers
    hardness causes further confusion in establishing a traceability chain and an
    uncertainty evaluation process. This confusion is partly caused by the characteristics
    of hardness value, i.e. a procedure-dependent property. In this paper, methods
    used for the establishment of traceability for Rockwell, Brinell and Vickers hardness
    measurements are discussed based on the concept defined in the VIM.</p>
