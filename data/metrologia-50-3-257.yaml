abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the results of the third European Comparison of Absolute
    Gravimeters held in Walferdange, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in November 2011.
    Twenty-two gravimeters from both metrological and non-metrological institutes
    are compared. For the first time, corrections for the laser beam diffraction and
    the self-attraction of the gravimeters are implemented. The gravity observations
    are also corrected for geophysical gravity changes that occurred during the comparison
    using the observations of a superconducting gravimeter. We show that these corrections
    improve the degree of equivalence between the gravimeters. We present the results
    for two different combinations of data. In the first one, we use only the observations
    from the metrological institutes. In the second solution, we include all the data
    from both metrological and non-metrological institutes. Those solutions are then
    compared with the official result of the comparison published previously and based
    on the observations of the metrological institutes and the gravity differences
    at the different sites as measured by non-metrological institutes. Overall, the
    absolute gravity meters agree with one another with a standard deviation of 3.1 µGal.
    Finally, the results of this comparison are linked to previous ones. We conclude
    with some important recommendations for future comparisons.</p>
