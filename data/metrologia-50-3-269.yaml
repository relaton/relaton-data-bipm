abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper examines signal detection in the presence of noise,
    with particular emphasis on nuclear activation analysis. The specific problem
    is to decide whether the signal-plus-background or the no-signal hypothesis fits
    the data better. Our solution is based on the use of Bayesian inferences to test
    the two hypotheses.</p>
