abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>GPS code measurements have been used for three decades for remote
    clock comparison, also called Time Transfer. Initially based on a technique using
    common-view (CV) single-frequency measurements, GPS time transfer now mostly uses
    dual-frequency measurements from geodetic receivers processed in all-in-view (AV).
    With the completion of the GLONASS constellation, it has been possible to readily
    use it in the CV single-frequency mode, providing results similar to GPS for short-distance
    time links. However GLONASS results are not readily equivalent to GPS in the dual-frequency
    AV mode, necessary for any moderate- to long-distance link, and this paper shows
    how to achieve this. We first present the GLONASS upgrade of the R2CGGTTS software,
    a tool to provide dual-frequency measurements in a format dedicated to time transfer
    named CGGTTS (Common GPS GLONASS Time Transfer Standard). The GLONASS navigation
    files are used to determine satellite clocks and positions, and dual-frequency
    pseudorange measurements are linearly combined to compute the CGGTTS results in
    a similar way as for GPS. In a second part, we present the combination of GPS
    and GLONASS into one unique time transfer solution based on AV. The results are
    first corrected using precise satellite orbit and clock products delivered by
    the IGS analysis centre ESOC, and characterized by the same reference for the
    GPS and GLONASS satellite clocks. Then, the need to introduce satellite-dependent
    hardware delays in GLONASS results is emphasized, and a procedure is proposed
    for their determination. The time transfer solutions obtained for GPS-only and
    GPS+GLONASS are then compared. The combination of GPS and GLONASS results in AV
    provides a time transfer solution having the same quality as GPS only. Furthermore,
    comparisons show that even when increasing the number of observations in CV thanks
    to the combination of the two constellations, the AV remains superior to the CV
    solution in terms of noise and short term stability, especially for long baselines.</p>
