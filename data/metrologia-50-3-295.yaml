abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In the case of metal–carbon eutectics, with transition temperatures
    above 1000 °C, the liquidus-point temperature, associated with melting, serves
    as a prime reference temperature. Factors influencing the shape of the melting
    curve and how to deal with them when specifying the liquidus temperature are the
    main subject of this paper. Influence factors investigated are the impurity factor,
    the furnace-temperature gradient, and a factor not considered before: the thermal
    inertia of the furnace and the associated transient in furnace temperature during
    melting. These investigations resulted in an improved method for determining the
    liquidus point, demonstrated for Co–C, which implicitly corrects for the post-melting
    effect, if any. In addition, a new method, the step-shift method, is proposed
    for the determination of the solidus point by direct observation. As shown, there
    is a clear justification for establishing reference methods to determining the
    solidus and liquidus points of M–C eutectics along the lines set out in this paper.</p>'
