abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The kilogram is the last unit of the international system of
    units (SI) still based on a material artefact, the international prototype of
    the kilogram (IPK). The comparisons made in the last hundred years have clearly
    revealed a long-term relative drift between the IPK and the official copies kept
    under similar conditions at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. A promising
    route towards a new definition of the kilogram based on a fundamental constant
    is represented by the watt balance experiment which links the mass unit to the
    Planck constant h. For more than ten years, the Federal Institute of Metrology
    METAS has been actively working in the conception and development of a watt balance
    experiment. This paper describes the new design of the Mark II METAS watt balance.
    The metrological characteristics of the different components of the experiment
    are described and discussed.</p>
