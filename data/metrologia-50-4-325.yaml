abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This article presents an efficient algorithm for determining
    the minimum circumscribed circle (MCC). The presented algorithm is able to select
    the control points for the MCC accurately from the entire data set based on the
    distance operator. Extensive examples have been carried out to validate the effectiveness
    of the proposed algorithm.</p>
