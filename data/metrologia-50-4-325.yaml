    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This article presents an efficient algorithm for determining the minimum circumscribed circle (MCC). The presented algorithm is able to select the control points for the MCC accurately from the entire data set based on the distance operator. Extensive examples have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>
