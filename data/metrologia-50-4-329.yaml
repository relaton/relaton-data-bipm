abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of contaminated
    water in the context of humidity generators. Investigation of different methods
    to determine the drop in dew-point temperature due to contamination and experiments
    on actual contamination rates are reported. Different methods for calculating
    the dew-point temperature effect from electrical conductivity and density measurements
    are studied with high-purity water and aqueous solutions of NaCl and LiCl. The
    outcomes of the calculation methods are compared with the results of direct humidity
    measurements. The results show that the often applied Raoult's law based calculation
    method is in good agreement with other methods.</p><p>For studying actual contamination,
    water samples were kept in glass, plastic, copper and stainless-steel vessels
    for up to 13 months to investigate natural ionic and organic contamination in
    vessels with different wall materials. The amount of ionic contamination was found
    to be higher in copper and glass vessels than in stainless-steel and plastic vessels.
    The amount of organic contamination was found to be highest in the plastic vessel.
    In all the cases, however, the corresponding drop in dew-point temperature due
    to natural contamination was found to be below 0.1 mK. The largest rate of change
    of dew-point temperature was 26 µK/month. Thus, if proper cleanness is maintained
    in a humidity generator the effect of contamination of water in the saturator
    is insignificant compared with the major uncertainty components even in the most
    accurate generators today.</p>
