abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Corrections for the so-called self-heating effect in measurements
    with resistance thermometers are made by extrapolating the resistances (or bridge
    readings) measured at two or more currents to obtain the value at 0 mA. Such corrections
    are of particular significance when using standard platinum resistance thermometers
    with the lowest uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to establish how to
    optimize the measurements so as to achieve the minimum uncertainty in the correction
    for a given total measurement time and maximum allowed measuring current. The
    assumptions are that the self-heating effect is proportional to the square of
    the current, and that the statistical uncertainties vary inversely with the current
    and with the square root of the measurement time. Under these assumptions it can
    be shown, using analytical or Monte Carlo methods, that there is no benefit in
    using more than two measuring currents to determine the correction, and that the
    uncertainty is minimized when the lower current is approximately 0.5 times the
    higher current. Specifically, it is shown that the optimum solution is to employ
    two measuring currents in the ratio 1 : 2 and allocate the measurement times at
    the lower and higher currents in the ratio 8 : 1. Under these conditions the uncertainty
    in the resistance extrapolated to zero current is equal to the uncertainty at
    the higher current and \n\n\n\n times the uncertainty at the lower current. It
    is expected that the techniques used here could be applied in other extrapolations,
    such as for isotherms in the various forms of gas thermometry.</p>"
