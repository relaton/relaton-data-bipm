  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>Corrections for the so-called self-heating
    effect in measurements with resistance thermometers are made by extrapolating
    the resistances (or bridge readings) measured at two or more currents to obtain
    the value at 0 mA. Such corrections are of particular significance when using
    standard platinum resistance thermometers with the lowest uncertainties. The purpose
    of this paper is to establish how to optimize the measurements so as to achieve
    the minimum uncertainty in the correction for a given total measurement time and
    maximum allowed measuring current. The assumptions are that the self-heating effect
    is proportional to the square of the current, and that the statistical uncertainties
    vary inversely with the current and with the square root of the measurement time.
    Under these assumptions it can be shown, using analytical or Monte Carlo methods,
    that there is no benefit in using more than two measuring currents to determine
    the correction, and that the uncertainty is minimized when the lower current is
    approximately 0.5 times the higher current. Specifically, it is shown that the
    optimum solution is to employ two measuring currents in the ratio 1 : 2 and allocate
    the measurement times at the lower and higher currents in the ratio 8 : 1. Under
    these conditions the uncertainty in the resistance extrapolated to zero current
    is equal to the uncertainty at the higher current and \n<inline-formula>\n<tex-math><?CDATA

    xlink:type=\"simple\"></inline-graphic>\n</inline-formula> times the uncertainty
    at the lower current. It is expected that the techniques used here could be applied
    in other extrapolations, such as for isotherms in the various forms of gas thermometry.</p>\n"
