abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Comité international des poids et mesures (CIPM) has projected
    a major revision of the International System of Units (SI) in which all of the
    base units will be defined by fixing the values of fundamental constants of nature.
    In preparation for this we have carried out a new, low-uncertainty determination
    of the Boltzmann constant, k<sub>B</sub>, in terms of which the SI unit of temperature,
    the kelvin, can be re-defined. We have evaluated k<sub>B</sub> from exceptionally
    accurate measurements of the speed of sound in argon gas which can be related
    directly to the mean molecular kinetic energy,. Our new estimate is k<sub>B</sub> = 1.380 651 56
    (98) × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup> with a relative standard uncertainty
    u<sub>R</sub> = 0.71 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
