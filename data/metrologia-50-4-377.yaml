abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two-capillary viscometry is useful for accurately measuring
    the temperature dependence of the viscosity of dilute gases. A number of publications
    show good agreement among measurements by two-capillary and primary viscometry,
    and ab initio calculation. To the authors' best knowledge, there is no publication
    describing the effects of connecting tubing on two-capillary viscometry. We present
    in this paper an investigation by a two-capillary viscometer on the effect of
    connecting tubing, the available Dean number range and a different method for
    the stabilization of gas pressures. Our study demonstrates that the incompatibility
    of connecting tubing causes a systematic error in measurement of dilute gas viscosity.
    The error diminishes with decreasing Dean number. We discuss the cause of such
    a systematic error based on analysis of the experimental data. We observe that
    a Dean number not exceeding 17 is available for our two-capillary viscometer with
    capillaries made from electro-polished stainless steel. We observed that a piece
    of coiled connection duct can suppress the instability in the gas pressure by
    two orders. The results of the above experimental investigations are reported
    in this paper.</p>
