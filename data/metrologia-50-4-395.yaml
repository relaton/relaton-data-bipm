    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) is intended to become a new primary standard for radiant power measurements in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 800 nm. Characterization results of custom-made single induced junction photodiodes as they are used in the PQED and of assembled PQEDs are presented. The single photodiodes were tested in terms of linearity and spatial uniformity of the spectral responsivity. The highly uniform photodiodes were proved to be linear over seven orders of magnitude, i.e. in the radiant power range from 100 pW to 400 µW. The assembled PQED has been compared with a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer with a very low uncertainty of the order of 30 ppm. Experimental results show good agreement with the modelled response of the PQED to optical radiation and prove a near unity external quantum efficiency.</p>
