abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) is intended
    to become a new primary standard for radiant power measurements in the wavelength
    range from 400 nm to 800 nm. Characterization results of custom-made single induced
    junction photodiodes as they are used in the PQED and of assembled PQEDs are presented.
    The single photodiodes were tested in terms of linearity and spatial uniformity
    of the spectral responsivity. The highly uniform photodiodes were proved to be
    linear over seven orders of magnitude, i.e. in the radiant power range from 100 pW
    to 400 µW. The assembled PQED has been compared with a cryogenic electrical substitution
    radiometer with a very low uncertainty of the order of 30 ppm. Experimental results
    show good agreement with the modelled response of the PQED to optical radiation
    and prove a near unity external quantum efficiency.</p>
