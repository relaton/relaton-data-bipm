abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The radiation temperature scale for a pyroelectric detector
    based thermal infrared thermometer with its spectral response from 8 µm to 14 µm
    was realized in the temperature range from 0 °C to 232 °C by using four fixed-point
    blackbodies (ice, Ga, In and Sn). The Planck version of the Sakuma–Hattori equation
    was used to interpolate the scale between the fixed-point temperatures that are
    corrected by considering a size-of-source effect (SSE). The expanded uncertainties
    (k = 2) of the scale were estimated to be 108 mK for ice, 99 mK for Ga, 175 mK
    for In and 234 mK for Sn.</p>
