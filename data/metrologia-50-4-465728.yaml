abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper provides useful and important information in gas
    metrology especially where high-precision gas mixtures are essential. Buoyancy
    effects due to cylinder expansion are taken into account as a source of uncertainty
    in weighing for the preparation of primary or standard gas mixtures by gravimetric
    methods. Potential effects of cylinder construction materials, nominal volumetric
    capacity and filling gas species on cylinder volume during the preparation of
    primary standard gas mixtures remain unknown in the current literature. It is
    also difficult to find experimental evidence to demonstrate the theory that cylinder
    expansion upon pressurization is linear. We therefore devised an indirect measurement
    method to measure apparent volume changes and ultimately estimate changes in the
    volume of highly pressurized cylinders. We found that changes in the volumes of
    some gas cylinders varied significantly with construction material and nominal
    volumetric capacity. The relative volume changes for aluminium alloy cylinders
    were about 30% higher than those for manganese steel cylinders regardless of the
    nominal volumetric capacity and the filling gas species. We also provide experimental
    evidence verifying that changes in cylinder volume follow nearly linear patterns
    within the pressure range from 12 MPa to 0.1 MPa. Our estimate for the volume
    expansion of an aluminium alloy cylinder of 5 dm<sup>3</sup> capacity with a pressure
    difference of 15 MPa is (15 ± 2) cm<sup>3</sup>. The reported value of about 20 cm<sup>3</sup>
    in ISO 6142 : 2001 would be regarded as a rough estimate.</p>
