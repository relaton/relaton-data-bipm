abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We have validated the laser-induced fluorescence technique
    to measure the quality of iodine cells whose transitions are used as a reference
    in laser standards for the realization of the definition of the metre. In this
    technique, the change in induced fluorescence is measured for different values
    of iodine pressure in the cell: for an iodine cell contaminated with foreign gases
    the fluorescence is more sensitive to iodine pressure changes than for a pure
    one due to collisional quenching of the excited states. We have measured the fluorescence
    parameter K<sub>o</sub> for a total of 96 iodine cells, and for each cell we correlated
    K<sub>o</sub> with the measured absolute frequency when the cell is inserted into
    laser standards at wavelengths 515 nm, 532 nm and 633 nm. We observed that the
    distribution of the quality of the produced iodine cells has a large dispersion
    and we believe that this also significantly affects the frequency distribution
    of the iodine-based laser standards that are used to realize the definition of
    the metre.</p>'
