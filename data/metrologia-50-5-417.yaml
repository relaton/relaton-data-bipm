- content: Abstract<p>We report improvements to our previous (Zhang et al 2011 Int.
    J. Thermophys. 32 1297) determination of the Boltzmann constant k<sub>B</sub>
    using a single 80 mm long cylindrical cavity. In this work, the shape of the gas-filled
    resonant cavity is closer to that of a perfect cylinder and the thermometry has
    been improved. We used two different grades of argon, each with measured relative
    isotopic abundances, and we used two different methods of supporting the resonator.
    The measurements with each gas and with each configuration were repeated several
    times for a total of 14 runs. We improved the analysis of the acoustic data by
    accounting for certain second-order perturbations to the frequencies from the
    thermo-viscous boundary layer. The weighted average of the data yielded k<sub>B</sub> = 1.380 6476 × 10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>
    with a relative standard uncertainty u<sub>r</sub>(k<sub>B</sub>) = 3.7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.
    This result differs, fractionally, by (−0.9 ± 3.7) × 10<sup>−6</sup> from the
    value recommended by CODATA in 2010. In this work, the largest component of the
    relative uncertainty resulted from inconsistent values of k<sub>B</sub> determined
    with the various acoustic modes; it is 2.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>. In our previous
    work, this component was 7.6 × 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
