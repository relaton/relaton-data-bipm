abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An autocollimator calibration facility has been developed based
    upon both a precision rotary table and a sine-bar. The traceability of the system
    is through sub-division of the circle and hence to the SI unit of angle, and does
    not require traceability to the definition of the metre. The rotary encoder that
    measures the angle of the rotary table is calibrated through circle closure techniques
    to a combined standard uncertainty of 0.013 arcsec at 5° intervals. The rotation
    of the sine-bar is measured by two interferometers, and together with the rotary
    encoder, enables calibration of the scale factor of an autocollimator to a combined
    standard uncertainty of 1.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup>.</p>
