abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>It has been recommended that the relative standard uncertainty
    of the numerical value of the Planck constant required for the redefinition of
    the kilogram should not exceed 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. To reach this goal using experiments
    based on a watt balance, the free-fall acceleration (g) traceable to the SI, at
    a given point and a given time, needs to be known with a sufficiently small uncertainty
    well below 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. Reducing the uncertainty in g allows the other
    uncertainties related to the watt balance to be increased. Instead of a simultaneous
    operation of an absolute gravimeter with a watt balance, we propose an alternative
    approach and demonstrate that a standard uncertainty below 5 µGal (relative uncertainty
    of 5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) is reachable under the conditions at BIPM. Further decreasing
    the uncertainty could significantly increase commitments in terms of personnel
    and equipment and would not significantly improve the uncertainty targeted for
    the BIPM watt balance experiment. A 5 µGal uncertainty might also satisfy the
    needs of other watt balance experiments underway or planned.</p><p> In our approach
    we combine the following information: (1) the Key Comparison Reference Values
    obtained from the CCM.G-K1, a key comparison carried out in the frame of the International
    Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters in 2009 (ICAG2009); (2) the accurate gravity
    network established using the qualified absolute and relative gravimeters; (3)
    temporal gravity variations based on observed Earth-tide parameters and modelled
    effects of polar motion and atmospheric mass redistribution; (4) uncertainty estimates
    that account for non-modelled effects; (5) the option to carry out absolute gravity
    measurements once every one or two years with two or more gravimeters for monitoring
    the stability of the gravity field at the BIPM.</p>'
