abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Although some of the adverse effects of the ultraviolet (UV)
    radiation may be strictly proportional to cumulative UV doses, others may relate
    to the frequency of extreme UV events. Therefore, an improved understanding of
    the UV global climate, including variability and trends, has become of great interest.
    Variability and trend analyses require quality-ensured surface UV series. The
    quality of surface UV data depends on their uncertainty. Building upon our prior
    efforts, we have used a Monte Carlo-based method to compute, under different conditions,
    the uncertainties affecting UV data rendered by models (1D radiative transfer
    models) and by spectroradiometers (double monochromator-based and CCD array-based).
    We found that the uncertainty of spectral UV measurements is driven by the signal-to-noise
    ratio of the detector, while the uncertainty of spectral UV calculations strongly
    depends on the uncertainty of the ozone input. The presented uncertainty figures
    allow comparison of the performance of modern UV gathering techniques (models
    and instruments), and provide a frame to assess the significance of differences
    when intercomparing.</p>
