abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We investigate the effect of port reflection in reflection measurements.
    Due to a high reflection coating of a sphere, the sphere's ports have thick edges,
    which cause reflection and contribute to the reflectance of the sphere. When the
    sphere is used in reflection measurements, the measured result may show a discrepancy
    with the theoretical prediction dealing with an ideal sphere with non-reflecting
    ports. To correct the reflection effects occurring at the port edges, we analytically
    calculate the contribution of the port edge reflection to the sphere reflectance
    and obtain a new correction factor for the absolute reflection measurement of
    Sharp and Little. Through a numerical calculation, we investigate the dependence
    of the new correction factor on the thickness of the port edges. For an experimental
    example, we perform a Sharpâ€“Little measurement to determine the reflectance of
    a sample using the new correction factor.</p>
