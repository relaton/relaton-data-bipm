abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two NIST programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS) systems
    are directly compared at 10 V using different nanovoltmeters. These PJVS systems
    use arrays of triple-stacked superconducting niobium Josephson junctions with
    barriers made of niobium silicide. Compared with the voltages produced by Josephson
    voltage standards based on hysteretic junctions, PJVS systems using damped junctions
    produce predictable voltage levels. However, in order to guarantee the quantization
    of the voltages and to minimize the errors at the room-temperature voltage output,
    additional precautions are required. We report several experimental results of
    voltage measurements that contain significant systematic errors. The generated
    voltages appear reproducible but they are, in fact, inaccurate. When proper measurement
    procedures are followed, the results of a direct comparison using an analogue
    detector show that the two independent PJVS systems agree within 2.6 parts in
    10<sup>11</sup> at 10 V with a relative total combined uncertainty of 3.4 parts
    in 10<sup>11</sup> (k = 1). Investigations show that the largest systematic error
    and most significant contribution to the uncertainty budget is caused by the leakage
    resistance of each PJVS to ground. This paper describes a measurement procedure
    to characterize this leakage resistance and one approach to including the resulting
    voltage error in the uncertainty budget.</p>
