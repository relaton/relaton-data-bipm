abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The expanded measurement uncertainty of a complex quantity is
    a region in the complex plane surrounding the measured value. This paper considers
    different shaped uncertainty regions in the form of ellipses, circles, rectangles
    and parallelograms. The different types of region are compared, under a variety
    of measurement error conditions, with regard to coverage probability and relative
    area. Elliptical confidence regions are commonly used in multivariate statistics.
    However, this shape has not been adopted widely in metrology, perhaps because
    there is no simple way to report the extent of an elliptical region. The other
    shapes considered are easier to use. Unfortunately, the coverage probability of
    circular uncertainty regions is found to be sensitive to both the form of the
    distribution of measurement errors and to the number of degrees of freedom, making
    this shape a poor choice. Parallelograms and rectangles both performed well, with
    parallelograms giving the best results overall.</p>
