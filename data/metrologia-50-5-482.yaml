abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The watt balance is operated in two asynchronous measurement
    modes to obtain the voltage–velocity ratio U/v and the force–current ratio mg/I,
    respectively. The magnetic flux density will change between the two modes when
    the effect due to the coil current is taken into account, particularly for watt
    balances using a soft magnetic material in the magnetic circuit. Normally, the
    linear component of the magnetic flux density change can be easily eliminated
    by reversing the coil current; however, the quadratic component remains as a systematic
    error, i.e. a non-linear error. In this paper, we use a theoretical analysis and
    a differential finite element method to investigate the behaviour of the quadratic
    dependence in a typical magnetic circuit. Several strategies are discussed to
    minimize this error in the magnetic system design for the watt balance.</p>
