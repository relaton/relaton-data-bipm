    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The watt balance is operated in two asynchronous measurement modes to obtain the voltage–velocity ratio <italic>U</italic>/<italic>v</italic> and the force–current ratio <italic>mg</italic>/<italic>I</italic>, respectively. The magnetic flux density will change between the two modes when the effect due to the coil current is taken into account, particularly for watt balances using a soft magnetic material in the magnetic circuit. Normally, the linear component of the magnetic flux density change can be easily eliminated by reversing the coil current; however, the quadratic component remains as a systematic error, i.e. a non-linear error. In this paper, we use a theoretical analysis and a differential finite element method to investigate the behaviour of the quadratic dependence in a typical magnetic circuit. Several strategies are discussed to minimize this error in the magnetic system design for the watt balance.</p>
