abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This paper compares the estimation results of two composite
    clock algorithms based on Kalman filtering of measured clock differences: the
    original Jonesâ€“Tryon algorithm and Greenhall''s covariance-reduction modification.
    The theory is carried out for a general clock model that includes the model introduced
    by Davis et al: the sum of the three-state linear model and a set of Markov processes
    used to approximate flicker-frequency noise. Since measurement noise is allowed,
    at each measurement time the corrected clock offsets (the difference between the
    clock offsets and their estimates) do not coincide but form a set of values, different
    for the two algorithms. The core result is that these two sets are congruent,
    that is, they differ by a common scalar shift. As a function of time the value
    of the shift behaves as a random walk. Moreover, the two Kalman filters have the
    same measurement residuals. Therefore, any detector algorithm that uses the measurement
    residuals is not impacted by the covariance reduction. The congruency holds for
    time-varying measurement matrices. Therefore, the result is applicable to the
    measurement setup of laboratories as well as that of a Global Navigation Satellite
    System with varying visibilities of satellite clocks at ground stations. These
    results are illustrated by a simulated ensemble of three caesium clocks and two
    active hydrogen masers, measured against one of the masers.</p>'
