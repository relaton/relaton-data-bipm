abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For photocurrent measurements with low uncertainties, wide dynamic
    range reference current-to-voltage converters and a new converter calibration
    method have been developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST). The high-feedback resistors of a reference converter were in situ calibrated
    on a high-resistivity, printed circuit board placed in an electrically shielded
    box electrically isolated from the operational amplifier using jumpers. The feedback
    resistors, prior to their installation, were characterized, selected and heat
    treated. The circuit board was cleaned with solvents, and the in situ resistors
    were calibrated using measurement systems for 10 kΩ to 10 GΩ standard resistors.
    We demonstrate that dc currents from 1 nA to 100 µA can be measured with uncertainties
    of 55 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (k = 2) or lower, which are lower in uncertainties than
    any commercial device by factors of 10 to 30 at the same current setting. The
    internal (NIST) validations of the reference converter are described.</p>
