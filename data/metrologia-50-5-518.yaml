abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The stability of prototype kilogram reference masses has been
    a long-standing question within the SI, with mass loss or gain at the surface
    being the principal concern. In papers I, III and IV of this series we showed
    mercury and organic carbonaceous contamination to be significant in sample surfaces
    exposed to typical prototype kilogram storage environments. In this work, we have
    examined the surfaces of six platinum mass standards manufactured in the mid-19th
    century. We used x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in order to identify mercury
    and carbonaceous contamination, and assess the validity of our previous models
    for the rate of increase. We use white-light interferometry to study surface roughness
    and polishing damage. We see mercury on all six of the 19th century polished prototypes
    we analysed. For one weight, manufactured around 1830, we see a quantity of mercury
    roughly equivalent to 250 µg if present on the surface of a prototype kilogram
    at the same mass per unit area. The quantities of these contaminations calculated
    from our XPS spectra are in good agreement with the theoretical models developed
    in papers III and IV for the growth of mercury and carbonaceous contamination,
    respectively, and increase our confidence that these processes are indeed happening
    at the surface of polished kilogram prototypes in most (if not all) cases. We
    discuss some potential sources of mercury contamination, though the most likely
    source remains the accidental breakage of thermometers and barometers containing
    mercury in the past. Mercury in laboratory air can adsorb and diffuse into defects
    and grain boundaries, especially at polished surfaces. We consider some possible
    ways to improve the situation, for example by placing a gold foil in the proximity
    of a prototype to act as a ‘getter’ that will preferentially adsorb mercury.</p>
