abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Mercury contamination and the build-up of carbonaceous contamination
    are two contributing factors to the instability observed in kilogram prototype
    masses. The kilogram prototypes that lie at the core of the dissemination of the
    SI base unit were manufactured in the late 19th century, and have polished surfaces.
    In papers IV and V of this series we developed a method for cleaning noble metal
    mass standards in air to remove carbonaceous contamination. At the core of this
    ‘UVOPS’ protocol is the application of UV light and ozone gas generated in situ
    in air. The precise nature of the carbonaceous contamination that builds up on
    such surfaces is difficult to mimic demonstrably or quickly on new test surfaces,
    yet data from such tests are needed to provide the final confidence to allow UVOPS
    to be applied to a real 19th century kilogram prototype. Therefore, in the present
    work we have applied the UVOPS method to clean a platinum avoirdupois pound mass
    standard, ‘RS2’, manufactured in the mid-19th century. This is thought to have
    been polished in a similar manner to the kilogram prototypes. To our knowledge
    this platinum surface has not previously been cleaned by any method. We used x-ray
    photoelectron spectroscopy to identify organic contamination, and weighing to
    quantify the mass lost at each application of the UVOPS procedure. The UVOPS procedure
    is shown to be very effective.</p><p>It is likely that the redefinition of the
    kilogram will require mass comparisons in vacuum in the years to come. Therefore,
    in addition to UVOPS a cleaning method for use in vacuum will also be needed.
    We introduce and evaluate gas cluster ion-beam (GCIB) treatment as a potential
    method for cleaning reference masses in vacuum. Again, application of this GCIB
    cleaning to a real artefact, RS2, allows us to make a realistic evaluation of
    its performance. While it has some attractive features, we cannot recommend it
    for cleaning mass standards in its present form.</p>
