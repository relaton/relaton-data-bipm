abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Haemoglobin concentration in blood is one of the most frequently
    measured analytes in laboratory medicine. Reference and routine methods for the
    determination of the haemoglobin concentration in blood are based on the conversion
    of haeme, haemoglobin and haemiglobin species into uniform end products. The total
    haemoglobin concentration in blood is measured using the absorbance of the reaction
    products. Traceable absorbance measurement values on the highest metrological
    level are a prerequisite for the calibration and evaluation of procedures with
    respect to their suitability for routine measurements and their potential as reference
    measurement procedures. For this purpose, we describe a procedure to establish
    traceability of spectral absorbance measurements for the haemiglobincyanide (HiCN)
    method and for the alkaline haematin detergent (AHD) method. The latter is characterized
    by a higher stability of the reaction product. In addition, the toxic hazard of
    cyanide, which binds to the iron ion of the haem group and thus inhibits the oxygen
    transport, is avoided. Traceability is established at different wavelengths by
    applying total least-squares analysis to derive the conventional quantity values
    for the absorbance from the measured values. Extrapolation and interpolation are
    applied to get access to the spectral regions required to characterize the Q-absorption
    bands of the HiCN and AHD methods, respectively. For absorbance values between
    0.3 and 1.8, the contributions of absorbance measurements to the total expanded
    uncertainties (95% level of confidence) of absorbance measurements range from
    1% to 0.4%.</p>
