abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The degrees of equivalence can be viewed as possibly the main
    result in the analysis of key comparison data. Their specification as given in
    the CIPM MRA is discussed and critically assessed in this paper. We argue that
    there is an ambiguity in the definition and meaning of the (unilateral) degrees
    of equivalence. As a consequence of this ambiguity uncertainties quoted for (unilateral)
    degrees of equivalence may be questioned. The ambiguity can be avoided by identifying
    the quantities that are being estimated by the degrees of equivalence, and we
    propose a standard statistical model to do this.</p><p>We then show that the degrees
    of equivalence are not a unique measure of consistency between the results and
    the underlying measurand when determined solely from the data. Prior knowledge
    or additional assumptions are needed for this purpose, and Bayesian methods are
    particularly suitable to handle that. However, such measures of consistency depend
    on the chosen additional assumptions and generally are not in accordance with
    the current CIPM MRA.</p><p>Fortunately, quantifying consistency between the results
    and the underlying measurand is not necessary in order to assess equivalence between
    the laboratories. We show that on the basis of the (unambiguous) pairwise degrees
    of equivalence the laboratories can be grouped into equivalent subsets, the largest
    of which may be chosen to select those laboratories whose CMCs are then viewed
    as validated.</p>
