abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty
    in the measurement of the peak temperature on the side face of a cutting tool,
    during the metal cutting process, by infrared thermography. The analysis considers
    the use of a commercial off-the-shelf camera and optics, typical of what is used
    in metal cutting research. A physics-based temperature measurement equation is
    considered and an analytical method is used to propagate the uncertainties associated
    with measurement variables to determine the overall temperature measurement uncertainty.
    A Monte Carlo simulation is used to expand on the analytical method by incorporating
    additional sources of uncertainty such as a point spread function (PSF) of the
    optics, difference in emissivity of the chip and tool, and motion blur. Further
    discussion is provided regarding the effect of sub-scenel averaging and magnification
    on the measured temperature values. It is shown that a typical maximum cutting
    tool temperature measurement results in an expanded uncertainty of U = 50.1 °C
    (k = 2). The most significant contributors to this uncertainty are found to be
    uncertainties in cutting tool emissivity and PSF of the imaging system.</p>
