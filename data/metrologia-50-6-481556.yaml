abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on our on-going effort to measure the Boltzmann constant,
    k<sub>B</sub>, using the Doppler broadening technique. The main systematic effects
    affecting the measurement are discussed. A revised error budget is presented in
    which the global uncertainty on systematic effects is reduced to 2.3 ppm. This
    corresponds to a reduction of more than one order of magnitude compared with our
    previous Boltzmann constant measurement. Means to reach a determination of k<sub>B</sub>
    at the part per million accuracy level are outlined.</p>
