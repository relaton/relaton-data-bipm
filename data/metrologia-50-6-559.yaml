    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The silver and copper fixed-point blackbody sources of NPL were directly compared with those of LNE-Cnam using an IKE LP3 and an IKE LP5 at three wavelengths (650 nm, 795 nm and 903 nm). The two silver fixed points and the two copper fixed points were in excellent agreement with each other, with a difference of 11 mK for the silver and within 16 mK for the copper, with an expanded measurement uncertainty of between 10 mK and 20 mK depending on the pyrometer used. The temperature interval between the silver and copper freezing points was also measured using combinations of all four fixed points. The results with the NPL LP3 gave a value for the silver–copper temperature interval of 122.89 °C with an expanded uncertainty of 30 mK; those with the LNE-Cnam LP5 gave a temperature interval of 122.87 °C also with an expanded uncertainty of 30 mK; this compares with the ITS-90 value of 122.84 °C.</p>
