    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Photodiodes play an important role in many optical systems and, as such, their stability and performance are of great importance. Manufacturers of such detectors typically only provide information regarding their sensitivity as a function of the optical wavelength and this is often sufficient for applications such as telecommunications. However, in certain applications such as primary ultrasonic standards based on interferometry, the frequency response of the photodiodes is of critical importance because, for accurate calibration, a correction factor must be applied, which contributes a major source of measurement uncertainty. Most optical calibration systems reported in the literature operate either in the GHz range or a very limited MHz range. This work reports on the development of a system based on rotational optical components that produces light patterns scanned through a slit at varying speeds using different deflection mechanisms. This results in the generation of spatially dependent interference fringes in the range 1 Hz up to 115 MHz with an expanded uncertainty of less than 5% for the majority of its frequency range of operation.</p>
