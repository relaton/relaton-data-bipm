abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Photodiodes play an important role in many optical systems and,
    as such, their stability and performance are of great importance. Manufacturers
    of such detectors typically only provide information regarding their sensitivity
    as a function of the optical wavelength and this is often sufficient for applications
    such as telecommunications. However, in certain applications such as primary ultrasonic
    standards based on interferometry, the frequency response of the photodiodes is
    of critical importance because, for accurate calibration, a correction factor
    must be applied, which contributes a major source of measurement uncertainty.
    Most optical calibration systems reported in the literature operate either in
    the GHz range or a very limited MHz range. This work reports on the development
    of a system based on rotational optical components that produces light patterns
    scanned through a slit at varying speeds using different deflection mechanisms.
    This results in the generation of spatially dependent interference fringes in
    the range 1 Hz up to 115 MHz with an expanded uncertainty of less than 5% for
    the majority of its frequency range of operation.</p>
