    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The primary calibration of pressure transducers is at present realized by static methods. This paper describes a new route to gaining traceability for dynamic calibration using the acousto-optic effect. The pressure range under consideration is up to 100Â MPa. We set out a description of the general principle employed to gain traceability, the experimental set-ups that are used for the realization and the thermophysical background of the measurements, and some numerical estimates on the expected results for two different pressure-transmitting media are shown.</p>
