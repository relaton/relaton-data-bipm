abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The primary calibration of pressure transducers is at present
    realized by static methods. This paper describes a new route to gaining traceability
    for dynamic calibration using the acousto-optic effect. The pressure range under
    consideration is up to 100Â MPa. We set out a description of the general principle
    employed to gain traceability, the experimental set-ups that are used for the
    realization and the thermophysical background of the measurements, and some numerical
    estimates on the expected results for two different pressure-transmitting media
    are shown.</p>
