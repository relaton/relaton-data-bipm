abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Multivariance oscillator noise analysis methods provide precise
    measurements of some noise sources of a high-performance oscillator, while others
    are inaccurate due to poor observability and an ill-conditioned problem. The ill-conditioned
    problem can be solved by separating the averaging time manually. The disadvantage
    of this strategy is that difficulties in execution arise when measuring noise
    sources from dynamic variances. This paper introduce an adaptive noise intensive
    coefficients estimator which separates the averaging time automatically and thus
    is executable on dynamic variances. Two cost functions, one of deterministic linear
    frequency drift and the other of noise intensity coefficients, are introduced
    to form the estimator. The estimator is tested with simulated data. In addition,
    a dynamic total variance is computed from more than 8.2 years of GPS clock data,
    and 31â€‰765 groups of noise intensity coefficients are estimated using the adaptive
    estimator. The results show that the adaptive noise intensity coefficient estimator
    is as precise as the multivariance oscillator noise analysis methods and is robust.</p>
