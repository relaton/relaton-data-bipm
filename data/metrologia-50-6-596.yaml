abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>NMI has established a non-contact aperture area measurement
    facility based on occlusion of a focused laser beam transmitted through the aperture
    being measured. The method is fast, accurate and insensitive to edge-defect-scatter.
    The aperture edge position is determined by local radial scans over 30 µm at 256
    points around the circumference, a sufficient number of positions to make aliasing
    errors negligible. An uncertainty analysis identifies 14 possible sources of uncertainty
    in the measured area including aliasing (circumference under-sampling), laser
    beam diffraction, edge-signal fitting, edge-scattered light and area integration
    choice. Excluding translation stage uncertainty, for an aperture radius of R = 3 mm
    the standard area uncertainty is 0.009%. When translation stage error is corrected
    using a calibrated line grid with standard uncertainty ±0.5 µm, and the uncertainty
    included, this yields a total standard uncertainty of 0.034% for an aperture with
    R = 3 mm.</p>
