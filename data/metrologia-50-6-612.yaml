abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An ac quantum voltmeter based on a 10 V programmable Josephson
    array that is simple to use, provides dc and ac calibration up to kHz range for
    equipment widely used in metrology, and ensures direct traceability to a quantum-based
    standard, is developed. This ac quantum voltmeter is proven to match conventional
    Josephson standard systems at dc and extends its advantages up to 10 kHz in the
    low-frequency ac range. The ac quantum voltmeter is capable of performing calibrations
    up to 7 V<sub>RMS</sub> in the frequency range from dc to 10 kHz completely under
    software control. A direct comparison at dc has demonstrated an uncertainty better
    than 2 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> (k = 2). The uncertainty at 1 kHz is better than
    1.7 µV V<sup>−1</sup> (k = 2) for a measurement time of 1 min. The ac quantum
    voltmeter is a robust and practical system that fulfils the needs of general metrology
    laboratories for quantum-based voltage calibrations.</p>
