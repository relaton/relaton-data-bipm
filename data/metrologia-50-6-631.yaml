abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recently, the need for calibration of dynamic pressure sensors
    has increased as calibration is required for more reliable measurements in advanced
    industries. Up until recently, most dynamic sensors have been calibrated by reference
    sensors, which were calibrated by static pressure standards. Dynamic calibrators
    are available, but in reality they are not traceable to the international standards.
    In the high-pressure range, reliable high dynamic pressure instruments using step
    pressure generators and their standardization are required. In this paper, step
    dynamic pressure without any ripple in the output signal was implemented by quick-opening
    valves. Since the impulse caused by a trigger mechanism was minimized, a ripple-free
    step pressure with a rise time below 1 ms could be generated up to 830 MPa (120 000 psi).
    In addition, the generated step dynamic pressure was estimated based on the density
    equations in order to establish the high dynamic pressure standard. The estimated
    dynamic pressure could be verified by analytical and experimental approaches.</p>
