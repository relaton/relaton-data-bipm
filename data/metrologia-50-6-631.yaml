    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Recently, the need for calibration of dynamic pressure sensors has increased as calibration is required for more reliable measurements in advanced industries. Up until recently, most dynamic sensors have been calibrated by reference sensors, which were calibrated by static pressure standards. Dynamic calibrators are available, but in reality they are not traceable to the international standards. In the high-pressure range, reliable high dynamic pressure instruments using step pressure generators and their standardization are required. In this paper, step dynamic pressure without any ripple in the output signal was implemented by quick-opening valves. Since the impulse caused by a trigger mechanism was minimized, a ripple-free step pressure with a rise time below 1 ms could be generated up to 830 MPa (120 000 psi). In addition, the generated step dynamic pressure was estimated based on the density equations in order to establish the high dynamic pressure standard. The estimated dynamic pressure could be verified by analytical and experimental approaches.</p>
