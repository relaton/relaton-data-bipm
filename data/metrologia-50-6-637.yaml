    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the uncertainty in the measurement of the peak temperature on the side face of a cutting tool, during the metal cutting process, by infrared thermography. The analysis considers the use of a commercial off-the-shelf camera and optics, typical of what is used in metal cutting research. A physics-based temperature measurement equation is considered and an analytical method is used to propagate the uncertainties associated with measurement variables to determine the overall temperature measurement uncertainty. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to expand on the analytical method by incorporating additional sources of uncertainty such as a point spread function (PSF) of the optics, difference in emissivity of the chip and tool, and motion blur. Further discussion is provided regarding the effect of sub-scenel averaging and magnification on the measured temperature values. It is shown that a typical maximum cutting tool temperature measurement results in an expanded uncertainty of <italic>U</italic> = 50.1 °C (<italic>k</italic> = 2). The most significant contributors to this uncertainty are found to be uncertainties in cutting tool emissivity and PSF of the imaging system.</p>
