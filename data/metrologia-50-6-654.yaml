abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An algorithm able to deal with any desired fitting model was
    developed for regression problems with uncertain and correlated variables.</p><p>A
    typical application concerns the determination of calibration curves, especially
    (i) in those cases in which the uncertainties on the independent variables x<sub>i</sub>
    cannot be considered negligible with respect to those associated with the dependent
    variables y<sub>i</sub>, and (ii) when correlations exist among x<sub>i</sub>
    and y<sub>i</sub>. In the metrological field, several types of software have already
    been dedicated to the determination of calibration curves, some being focused
    just on problem (i) and a few others considering also problem (ii) but only for
    a straight-line fitting model. The proposed algorithm is able to deal with problems
    (i) and (ii) at the same time, for a generic fitting model. The tool was developed
    in the MATLABÂ® environment and validated on several benchmark data sets, fitted
    with linear and non-linear regression models.</p><p>A review of the most commonly
    applied approximations to the parameter uncertainty is also presented, together
    with a Monte Carlo method proposed for comparison purposes with the results provided
    by the formula for the uncertainty evaluation which is implemented in the software.</p>
