    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>An algorithm able to deal with any desired fitting model was developed for regression problems with uncertain and correlated variables.</p>
    <p>A typical application concerns the determination of calibration curves, especially (i) in those cases in which the uncertainties on the independent variables <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> cannot be considered negligible with respect to those associated with the dependent variables <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and (ii) when correlations exist among <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. In the metrological field, several types of software have already been dedicated to the determination of calibration curves, some being focused just on problem (i) and a few others considering also problem (ii) but only for a straight-line fitting model. The proposed algorithm is able to deal with problems (i) and (ii) at the same time, for a generic fitting model. The tool was developed in the MATLABÂ® environment and validated on several benchmark data sets, fitted with linear and non-linear regression models.</p>
    <p>A review of the most commonly applied approximations to the parameter uncertainty is also presented, together with a Monte Carlo method proposed for comparison purposes with the results provided by the formula for the uncertainty evaluation which is implemented in the software.</p>
