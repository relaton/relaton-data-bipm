abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper reports an interlaboratory comparison that evaluated
    a protocol for measuring and analysing the particle size distribution of discrete,
    metallic, spheroidal nanoparticles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
    The study was focused on automated image capture and automated particle analysis.
    NIST RM8012 gold nanoparticles (30 nm nominal diameter) were measured for area-equivalent
    diameter distributions by eight laboratories. Statistical analysis was used to
    (1) assess the data quality without using size distribution reference models,
    (2) determine reference model parameters for different size distribution reference
    models and non-linear regression fitting methods and (3) assess the measurement
    uncertainty of a size distribution parameter by using its coefficient of variation.
    The interlaboratory area-equivalent diameter mean, 27.6 nm ± 2.4 nm (computed
    based on a normal distribution), was quite similar to the area-equivalent diameter,
    27.6 nm, assigned to NIST RM8012. The lognormal reference model was the preferred
    choice for these particle size distributions as, for all laboratories, its parameters
    had lower relative standard errors (RSEs) than the other size distribution reference
    models tested (normal, Weibull and Rosin–Rammler–Bennett). The RSEs for the fitted
    standard deviations were two orders of magnitude higher than those for the fitted
    means, suggesting that most of the parameter estimate errors were associated with
    estimating the breadth of the distributions. The coefficients of variation for
    the interlaboratory statistics also confirmed the lognormal reference model as
    the preferred choice. From quasi-linear plots, the typical range for good fits
    between the model and cumulative number-based distributions was 1.9 fitted standard
    deviations less than the mean to 2.3 fitted standard deviations above the mean.
    Automated image capture, automated particle analysis and statistical evaluation
    of the data and fitting coefficients provide a framework for assessing nanoparticle
    size distributions using TEM for image acquisition.</p>
