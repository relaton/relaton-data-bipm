abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on a new accurate investigation tool whose principle
    is that of a Michelson interferometer with a broadband source, namely a phase-sensitive
    optical low-coherence interferometer, used to interrogate an optical micro-resonator
    based sensor for label-free biosensing applications. This set-up, which is able
    to provide the amplitude and also the phase of the guided mode in a single measurement,
    is also used to evaluate the performances of the micro-resonators. The best vertically
    coupled polymer racetrack micro-resonator fabricated displays a Q-factor higher
    than 38 000 and a finesse of 21 at 1527.7 nm when immersed in deionized water.
    The association of the phase-sensitive optical low coherence interferometer and
    the vertically coupled polymer micro-resonator in an opto-fluidic cell for biosensing
    applications was tested and allowed the detection of a concentration of glucose
    in water solution around 0.23 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
