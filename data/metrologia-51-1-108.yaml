abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the first contribution to international atomic time
    (TAI) based on a secondary representation of the SI second. This work is done
    with the LNE-SYRTE FO2-Rb fountain frequency standard using the<sup>87</sup>Rb
    ground-state hyperfine transition. We describe FO2-Rb and how it is connected
    to local and international time scales. We report on local measurements of this
    frequency standard in the SI system, i.e. against primary frequency standards
    (PFSs), down to a fractional uncertainty of 4.4 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, and on the
    establishment of the recommended value for the<sup>87</sup>Rb hyperfine transition
    by the CIPM. We also report on the process that led to the participation of the
    FO2-Rb frequency standard in Circular T and to the elaboration of TAI. This participation
    enables us to demonstrate absolute frequency measurement directly in terms of
    the SI second realized by the TAI ensemble with a statistical uncertainty of 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>,
    therefore at the limit allowed by the accuracy of PFSs. This work constitutes
    a demonstration of how other secondary representations, based on optical transitions,
    could also be used for TAI, and an investigation of a number of issues relevant
    to a future redefinition of the SI second.</p>
