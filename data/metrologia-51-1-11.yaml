    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A problem that frequently occurs in metrology is one of assessing compatibility of data obtained by a user laboratory with the specified values and uncertainty estimates from the certificate of analysis. The user's data are summarized by an estimated measurand value and a confidence interval, which is typically based on a repeatability standard deviation, but may include other variance or bias components. If the lab's interval and the certificate interval do not overlap, or more generally when the ‘no-bias’ hypothesis is rejected, the user may seek guidance on how to confirm this lack of compatibility or how to rectify it. The suggested two-stage statistical approach demonstrates a confidence interval whose width is similar to that of the certificate, and a compatibility test of guaranteed power for the given bias magnitude. Practical computationally simple formulae for each stage sample size are provided.</p>
