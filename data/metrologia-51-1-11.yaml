abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A problem that frequently occurs in metrology is one of assessing
    compatibility of data obtained by a user laboratory with the specified values
    and uncertainty estimates from the certificate of analysis. The user's data are
    summarized by an estimated measurand value and a confidence interval, which is
    typically based on a repeatability standard deviation, but may include other variance
    or bias components. If the lab's interval and the certificate interval do not
    overlap, or more generally when the ‘no-bias’ hypothesis is rejected, the user
    may seek guidance on how to confirm this lack of compatibility or how to rectify
    it. The suggested two-stage statistical approach demonstrates a confidence interval
    whose width is similar to that of the certificate, and a compatibility test of
    guaranteed power for the given bias magnitude. Practical computationally simple
    formulae for each stage sample size are provided.</p>
