abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We use a terahertz echo pulse as a transfer standard to correct
    linear time-base errors of a terahertz spectrometer. With this calibration technique,
    the linear error of the translate stage is corrected and the spectral repeatability
    of the spectrometer is improved. This calibration technique is able to correct
    each ‘shot’ of the terahertz pulse and can realize on-line calibration of the
    terahertz spectrum. The average of multiple measurements of carbon monoxide gas
    absorption lines was corrected and the deviation was reduced by a factor of 2.5
    using this technique. This on-line calibration technique needs no additional optical
    components and causes no performance degradation of the terahertz spectrometer.
    It provides a simple and alternative method to the conventional interferometric
    technique and allows for accurate measurement of spectral properties of specimens
    in the terahertz region.</p>
