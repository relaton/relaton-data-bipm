abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present an instrumental realization of linearity measurement
    of optical detectors based on flux addition of two light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
    in an integrating sphere. The instrument measures the linearity ratios at pre-defined
    photocurrent levels according to the algorithm which eliminates the drift effect
    of LED flux (Shin D J et al 2005 Metrologia 42 154). As a result, the non-linearity
    correction factors for detector responsivity are determined with their relative
    standard uncertainties ranging from 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 6 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
    (k = 1) for photocurrent ranges from 10<sup>−8</sup> A to 10<sup>−3</sup> A. By
    changing the type of LEDs, the wavelength dependence of non-linearity can also
    be measured, which is demonstrated at 390 nm, 670 nm and 750 nm for a Si photodiode
    used as a transfer standard for spectral responsivity scale comparisons.</p>
