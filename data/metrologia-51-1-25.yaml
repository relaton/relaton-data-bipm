    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We present an instrumental realization of linearity measurement of optical detectors based on flux addition of two light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in an integrating sphere. The instrument measures the linearity ratios at pre-defined photocurrent levels according to the algorithm which eliminates the drift effect of LED flux (Shin D J <italic>et al</italic> 2005 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/42/2/011" xlink:type="simple"><bold>42</bold> 154</ext-link>). As a result, the non-linearity correction factors for detector responsivity are determined with their relative standard uncertainties ranging from 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> to 6 × 10<sup>−5</sup> (<italic>k</italic> = 1) for photocurrent ranges from 10<sup>−8</sup> A to 10<sup>−3</sup> A. By changing the type of LEDs, the wavelength dependence of non-linearity can also be measured, which is demonstrated at 390 nm, 670 nm and 750 nm for a Si photodiode used as a transfer standard for spectral responsivity scale comparisons.</p>
