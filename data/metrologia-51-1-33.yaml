    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Considering the evolving needs of time metrology and the convenience of allowing the contributing laboratories access to a realization of UTC more frequently than through the monthly <italic>Circular T</italic>, the BIPM Time Department started in 2012 to implement the computation of UTCr, a rapid realization of UTC published every week and based on daily data. After 18 months of pilot experiment, this new product has been declared operational and is now an official publication of the BIPM. This paper presents the main characteristics and properties of UTCr.</p>
