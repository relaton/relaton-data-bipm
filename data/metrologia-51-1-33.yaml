abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Considering the evolving needs of time metrology and the convenience
    of allowing the contributing laboratories access to a realization of UTC more
    frequently than through the monthly Circular T, the BIPM Time Department started
    in 2012 to implement the computation of UTCr, a rapid realization of UTC published
    every week and based on daily data. After 18 months of pilot experiment, this
    new product has been declared operational and is now an official publication of
    the BIPM. This paper presents the main characteristics and properties of UTCr.</p>
