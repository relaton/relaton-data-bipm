abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This study presents a detailed analysis of the uncertainties
    affecting the normalized water-leaving radiance (L<sub>WN</sub>) from above-water
    measurements performed within the context of the Ocean Colour component of the
    Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). The analysis, conducted in agreement with
    the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’ (GUM), indicates uncertainties
    of L<sub>WN</sub> markedly dependent on the optical properties of seawater for
    a number of AERONET-OC sites located in different marine regions. Results obtained
    for the Adriatic Sea site, characterized by a large variety of measurement conditions,
    confirm previous uncertainties from an independent study indicating median values
    of relative combined uncertainties of 5% in the blue–green part of the spectrum
    and of approximately 7% in the red. Additional investigations show that the former
    uncertainties can be reduced by ∼1% when restricting the determination of AERONET-OC
    L<sub>WN</sub> to measurements performed at low sun zenith angle and low aerosol
    optical thickness.</p>
