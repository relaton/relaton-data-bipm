    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This study presents a detailed analysis of the uncertainties affecting the normalized water-leaving radiance (<italic>L</italic><sub>WN</sub>) from above-water measurements performed within the context of the Ocean Colour component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC). The analysis, conducted in agreement with the <italic>‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’</italic> (GUM), indicates uncertainties of <italic>L</italic><sub>WN</sub> markedly dependent on the optical properties of seawater  for a number of AERONET-OC sites located in different marine regions. Results obtained for the Adriatic Sea site, characterized by a large variety of measurement conditions, confirm previous uncertainties from an independent study indicating median values of relative combined uncertainties of 5% in the blue–green part of the spectrum and of approximately 7% in the red. Additional investigations show that the former uncertainties can be reduced by ∼1% when restricting the determination of AERONET-OC <italic>L</italic><sub>WN</sub> to measurements performed at low sun zenith angle and low aerosol optical thickness.</p>
