abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In order to determine the difference in the screening of protons
    in water and protons in hydrogen, the authors used cylindrical samples and recordied
    NMR signals in the field of an electromagnet (B = 2.142 T) and a superconducting
    magnet (B = 11.747 T). The use of two magnets allows the influence of the volume
    magnetic susceptibility of the samples to be eliminated. The difference in the
    chemical shift for protons in water and hydrogen is found to be σ(H<sub>2</sub>) − σ(H<sub>2</sub>O) = 608.0(±1.5) × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    at 25.0 °C. The value of proton screening in hydrogen σ(H<sub>2</sub>) is known
    from the literature: σ(H<sub>2</sub>) = 26 288(±2) × 10<sup>−9</sup>. With this
    in mind, for the screening of protons in water we have σ(H<sub>2</sub>O) = 25 680(±2.5) × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    at 25.0 °C. The new result should be compared with the result for the screening
    of protons in water σ(H<sub>2</sub>O) = 25 694(±14) × 10<sup>−9</sup> at 25.0 °C,
    which is shown in the list of fundamental physical constants (CODATA). This comparison
    shows that, although the two results were obtained by completely different methods,
    they agree within the limits of uncertainty.</p>'
