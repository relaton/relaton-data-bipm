abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The results of analytical measurements performed with solid-sampling
    techniques are affected by the distribution of the analytes within the matrix.
    The effect becomes significant in the case of determination of trace elements
    in small subsamples. In this framework we propose a measurement model based on
    Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis to determine the relative variability
    of the amount of an analyte among subsamples of a material. The measurement uncertainty
    is evaluated and includes the counting statistics, the full-energy gamma peak
    efficiency and the spatial gradient of the neutron flux at the irradiation position.
    The data we obtained in a neutron activation experiment and showing the relative
    variability of As, Au, Ir, Sb and W among subsamples of a highly pure Rh foil
    are also presented.</p>
