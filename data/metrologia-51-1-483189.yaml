abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We review the principles, techniques and results from primary
    acoustic gas thermometry (AGT). Since the establishment of ITS-90, the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990, spherical and quasi-spherical cavity resonators have
    been used to realize primary AGT in the temperature range 7 K to 552 K. Throughout
    the sub-range 90 K &lt; T &lt; 384 K, at least two laboratories measured (T − T<sub>90</sub>).
    (Here T is the thermodynamic temperature and T<sub>90</sub> is the temperature
    on ITS-90.) With a minor exception, the resulting values of (T − T<sub>90</sub>)
    are mutually consistent within 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> T. These consistent measurements
    were obtained using helium and argon as thermometric gases inside cavities that
    had radii ranging from 40 mm to 90 mm and that had walls made of copper or aluminium
    or stainless steel. The AGT values of (T − T<sub>90</sub>) fall on a smooth curve
    that is outside ±u(T<sub>90</sub>), the estimated uncertainty of T<sub>90</sub>.
    Thus, the AGT results imply that ITS-90 has errors that could be reduced in a
    future temperature scale. Recently developed techniques imply that low-uncertainty
    AGT can be realized at temperatures up to 1350 K or higher and also at temperatures
    in the liquid-helium range.</p>
