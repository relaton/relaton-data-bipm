abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A few years ago, a 1 N m deadweight torque standard machine
    was developed, constructed and put into operation at PTB in Germany. Since then,
    this machine has been used for measurements, but also, investigations of its stability
    and reproducibility have been carried out. The machine utilizes calibrated stainless-steel
    masses as weights and a lever made of Invar which is supported by an H-type air
    bearing. The measurement range starts at 1 mN m. Depending on the weights used,
    various torque steps are possible. The best expanded ( k  = 2) relative uncertainty
    of measurement is 0.01%. In the following, technical details and metrological
    characteristics of this machine will be given.</p>
