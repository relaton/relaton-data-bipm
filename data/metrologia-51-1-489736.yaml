abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The publication of the standard atomic weights of 2009 by IUPAC
    raised the question of to what extent these changes affect the calculated composition
    of reference and calibration gas mixtures and the associated measurement uncertainty.
    The smallest uncertainties are attainable in the gravimetric gas mixture preparation,
    so the assessment was made for this technique. For the first time, the uncertainty
    contributions to the overall budget due to weighing, molecular weights, and composition
    of the parent gases are reported separately.</p><p>The calculations show that
    even with the standard atomic weights of 2007, the uncertainty contribution due
    to the molecular weights can be of the same order as that due to weighing. The
    standard atomic weights of 2009 and 2011, when used under the same assumptions,
    increase the uncertainties of the amount-of-substance fractions of the abundant
    components from high-purity parent gases sometimes appreciably.</p><p>Based on
    these calculations and the fact that the atomic weight intervals include sources
    that are unlikely to be generally relevant for measurements supporting trade,
    commerce, health and safety, there is a need to make a more in-depth analysis
    of the atomic weights used in calculations, and to reflect the knowledge about
    the isotopic composition of relevant materials in the value assignment and uncertainty
    calculation.</p>
