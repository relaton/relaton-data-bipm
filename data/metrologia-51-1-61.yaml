abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Three certified reference materials produced from powdered
    seeds to measure the copy number ratio sequences of p35S/hmgA in maize containing
    MON 810 event, p35S/Le1 in soybeans containing GTS 40-3-2 event and DREB1A/acc1
    in wheat were produced according to the ISO Guides 34 and 35. In this paper, we
    report digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) protocols, performance parameters
    and results of copy number ratio content of genetically modified organisms (GMOs)
    in these materials using two new dPCR systems to detect and quantify molecular
    deoxyribonucleic acid: the BioMark® (Fluidigm) and the OpenArray® (Life Technologies)
    systems. These technologies were implemented at the National Institute of Metrology
    in Mexico (CENAM) and in the Reference Center for GMO Detection from the Ministry
    of Agriculture (CNRDOGM), respectively. The main advantage of this technique against
    the more-used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is that it generates
    an absolute number of target molecules in the sample, without reference to standards
    or an endogenous control, which is very useful when not much information is available
    for new developments or there are no standard reference materials in the market
    as in the wheat case presented, or when it was not possible to test the purity
    of seeds as in the maize case presented here. Both systems reported enhanced productivity,
    increased reliability and reduced instrument footprint. In this paper, the performance
    parameters and uncertainty of measurement obtained with both systems are presented
    and compared.</p>'
