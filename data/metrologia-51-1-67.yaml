abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy of proteins is widely used
    to measure protein secondary structure, and to detect changes in secondary and
    higher orders of structure, for applications in research and in the quality control
    of protein products such as biopharmaceuticals. However, objective comparison
    of spectra is challenging because of a limited quantitative understanding of the
    sources of error in the measurement. Statistical methods can be used for comparisons,
    but do not provide a mechanism for dealing with systematic, as well as random,
    errors. Here we present a measurement model for CD spectroscopy of proteins, incorporating
    the principal sources of uncertainty, and use the model in conjunction with experimental
    data to derive an uncertainty budget. We show how this approach could be used
    in practice for the objective comparison of spectra, and discuss the benefits
    and limitations of this strategy.</p>
