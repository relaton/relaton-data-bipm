abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A model based on Lamb's theory of gas lasers is applied to a
    He–Ne ring laser (RL) gyroscope to estimate and remove the laser dynamics contribution
    from the rotation measurements. The intensities of the counter-propagating laser
    beams exiting one cavity mirror are continuously observed together with a monitor
    of the laser population inversion. These observables, once properly calibrated
    with a dedicated procedure, allow us to estimate cold cavity and active medium
    parameters driving the main part of the non-linearities of the system. The quantitative
    estimation of intrinsic non-reciprocal effects due to cavity and active medium
    non-linear coupling plays a key role in testing fundamental symmetries of space–time
    with RLs. The parameter identification and noise subtraction procedure has been
    verified by means of a Monte Carlo study of the system, and experimentally tested
    on the G-PISA RL oriented with the normal to the ring plane almost parallel to
    the Earth's rotation axis. In this configuration the Earth's rotation rate provides
    the maximum Sagnac effect while the contribution of the orientation error is reduced
    to a minimum. After the subtraction of laser dynamics by a Kalman filter, the
    relative systematic errors of G-PISA reduce from 50 to 5 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>
    and can be attributed to the residual uncertainties on geometrical scale factor
    and orientation of the ring.</p>
