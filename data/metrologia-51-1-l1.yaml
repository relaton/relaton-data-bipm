    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This note discusses some problems that should be taken into account in the implementation of the proposed use of fundamental constants in the definition of measurement units: use of CODATA adjusted values of the constants for this specific purpose; how the CODATA Task Group could continue performing meaningful least squares adjustments of the fundamental constants taking into account future data.</p>
