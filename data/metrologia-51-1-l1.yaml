abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This note discusses some problems that should be taken into
    account in the implementation of the proposed use of fundamental constants in
    the definition of measurement units: use of CODATA adjusted values of the constants
    for this specific purpose; how the CODATA Task Group could continue performing
    meaningful least squares adjustments of the fundamental constants taking into
    account future data.</p>'
