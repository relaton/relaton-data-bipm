    <p>The objective of this comparison was to compare the measurement capabilities of INMETRO and LNE in the field of AC–DC voltage transfer.</p>
    <p>INMETRO participated in the previous SIM comparison of AC–DC voltage transfer standards in 2004. In the last few years INMETRO has been improving the methodology of its AC–DC voltage transfer difference measurements, now using multijunction thermal converters.</p>
    <p>The degrees of equivalence of INMETRO relative to the corresponding CCEM key comparison reference values range between 0.1 µV/V and 10 µV/V in the frame of the SIM.EM-K6.1 key comparison, and between 0.5 µV/V and 4 µV/V in the frame of the SIM.EM-K9.1 key comparison. In all cases, they are consistent with the associated uncertainties.</p>
    <p>For results that are not linked to CCEM key comparisons, the agreement between INMETRO and LNE is very good at 1.5 V/50 kHz (0.1 µV/V). At 10 Hz (at 1.5 V and at 1000 V) a larger difference is observed between the two laboratories, which remains nevertheless consistent with the given uncertainties.</p>
