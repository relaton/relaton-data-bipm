    <p>The CIPM MRA states that its technical basis is a set of results obtained in a course of time through key comparisons carried out by the Consultative Committees of the CIPM, the BIPM and the Regional Metrology Organizations (RMOs). As part of this process, INTI (Argentina) has participated in several key and supplementary comparisons. By means of procedures for linking key comparison data, a bilateral comparison would help to provide assurance of equality in measurements between the participating laboratories. With this end, the comparison SIM.EM-S9.b of 1 ohm and 10 kiloohm standard resistors of INIMET (Cuba) and INTI was carried out from March to October 2012.</p>
    <p>The obtained results were very good. They show that the resistance standards maintained by INTI and INIMET were equivalent, within their combined uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p>
