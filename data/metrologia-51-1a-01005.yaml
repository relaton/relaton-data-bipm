    <p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison of the 1 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the Institut National de Metrologie (INM), Bucharest, Romania, was carried out from August to October 2013. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_7 (Z7) and BIPM_8 (Z8), were transported by freight to INM. At INM, the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage Standard. The output EMF (electromotive force) of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the primary standard.</p>
    <p>At the BIPM, the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at INM, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>
    <p>The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned to DC voltage standards by INM, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at INM, <italic>U</italic><sub>INM</sub>, and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of 6 September 2013.</p>
    <p><italic>U</italic><sub>INM</sub> − <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = −0.014 µV; <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.051 µV, at 1 V</p>
    <p><italic>U</italic><sub>INM</sub> − <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = −0.43 µV; <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.34 µV, at 10 V</p>
    <p>where <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at INM, based on <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p>
    <p>These are satisfactory results. The comparison results show that the voltage standards maintained by INM and the BIPM were equivalent, within the comparison uncertainty, on the mean date of the comparison.</p>
