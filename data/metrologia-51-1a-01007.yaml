    <p>The comparison of a loop antenna factor measurement has been performed. One of the motivations for this comparison was that since the last comparison in this field (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/44/1A/01006">CCEM.RF-S21.F</ext-link>), several National Metrology Institutes have implemented the calibration capabilities for antenna measurements. The second motivation is that the loop antennas are typically working over a large frequency range, in this case 10 Hz to 30 MHz. For the calibration over this frequency span, two ranges are distinguished: the low frequency range where alternating current (AC) techniques should be used, and the high frequency range where radio-frequency (RF) measurement techniques are applied. The comparison shows that the participants were able to measure within the declared uncertainties.</p>
