    <p>The decision to carry out a COOMET supplementary comparison in the field of magnetic loss power measurements was taken in October 2010. It is registered in the BIPM key comparison database with the identifier COOMET.EM-S12. The comparison was piloted by UNIIM (Russia) and two other laboratories participated, namely PTB (Germany) and CMI (Czech Republic).</p>
    <p>The results of the comparison allow one to demonstrate the equivalence of the standards of the three National Metrology Institutes, and thus confirm the corresponding claimed Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs).</p>
    <p>It is noted that the deviation of the measurement results obtained with sheet samples exceeds that obtained with samples of toroidal form and of Epstein strips, a point that requires further investigation.</p>
