    <p>The decision to carry out a COOMET supplementary comparison in the field of magnetic loss power measurements was taken in October 2010. It is registered in the BIPM key comparison database with the identifier COOMET.EM-S12. The comparison was piloted by UNIIM (Russia) and two other laboratories participated, namely PTB (Germany) and CMI (Czech Republic).</p><p>The results of the comparison allow one to demonstrate the equivalence of the standards of the three National Metrology Institutes, and thus confirm the corresponding claimed Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs).</p><p>It is noted that the deviation of the measurement results obtained with sheet samples exceeds that obtained with samples of toroidal form and of Epstein strips, a point that requires further investigation.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
