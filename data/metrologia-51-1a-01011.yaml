abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>An on-site comparison of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) resistance standards of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made in November 2013. Measurements of a 100 Ω standard in terms of the conventional value of the von Klitzing constant, R<sub>K-90</sub>, agreed to 5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with a relative combined standard uncertainty u<sub>c</sub> = 22 × 10<sup>−10</sup>. Measurements of 10000 Ω/100 Ω and 100 Ω/1 Ω ratios agreed to 7 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with u<sub>c</sub> = 19 × 10<sup>−10</sup> and to 8 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with u<sub>c</sub> = 40 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, respectively. An investigation of the Peltier effect present in 1 Ω standards was carried out during this comparison and is also reported, as it was found to be the limiting factor in these measurements.</p><p>Main text.
