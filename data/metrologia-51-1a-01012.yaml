    <p>A bilateral resistance comparison of 10 Ω and 100 kΩ resistance standards has been performed between GEOSTM (Georgia) and PTB (Germany) to justify the CMC claims of GEOSTM. The differences of the results at GEOSTM and PTB are very small and lie well within the combined standard uncertainties of the measurements, and therewith support the CMC claims of GEOSTM for resistance measurements.</p>
