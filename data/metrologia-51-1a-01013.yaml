    <p>A bilateral comparison of the measurement of current transformers was carried out between UNIIM (Russia) and PTB (Germany).</p>
    <p>For all of the current ratio error measurements and the phase displacement measurements there is a close agreement between PTB and UNIIM. Extensive measurements with the travelling standards were carried out at 18 different current ratios and at 5 different test points (1%, 5%, 20%, 100% and 120%) each. The range of tested primary currents was from 10 mA to 60 kA. It can therefore be concluded that the results of each laboratory agree very well within the calculated measurement uncertainties. No outliers were observed.</p>
    <p>Considering especially the <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub> factors, the calculated uncertainties seem to be too conservative to some extent. Here there is the possibility to slightly improve the uncertainty budgets in the future if there is a need.</p>
    <p>The worst <italic>E</italic><sub>n</sub> factors are within ±0.6 at 1 kA/5 A and ±0.8 at 3 kA. The current comparator 'IW 32' from PTB may have caused that. This was subsequently confirmed. The primary current induced a small voltage in the compensation winding. This problem has now been solved.</p>
