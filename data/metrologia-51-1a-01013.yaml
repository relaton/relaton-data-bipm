abstract:
- content: "<p>A bilateral comparison of the measurement of current transformers was
    carried out between UNIIM (Russia) and PTB (Germany).</p><p>For all of the current
    ratio error measurements and the phase displacement measurements there is a close
    agreement between PTB and UNIIM. Extensive measurements with the travelling standards
    were carried out at 18 different current ratios and at 5 different test points
    (1%, 5%, 20%, 100% and 120%) each. The range of tested primary currents was from
    10 mA to 60 kA. It can therefore be concluded that the results of each laboratory
    agree very well within the calculated measurement uncertainties. No outliers were
    observed.</p><p>Considering especially the  E<sub>n</sub> factors, the calculated
    uncertainties seem to be too conservative to some extent. Here there is the possibility
    to slightly improve the uncertainty budgets in the future if there is a need.</p><p>The
    worst  E<sub>n</sub> factors are within ±0.6 at 1 kA/5 A and ±0.8 at 3 kA. The
    current comparator 'IW 32' from PTB may have caused that. This was subsequently
    confirmed. The primary current induced a small voltage in the compensation winding.
    This problem has now been solved.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
