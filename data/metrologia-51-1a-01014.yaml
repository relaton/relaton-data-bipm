    <p>A bilateral comparison of magnetic flux density has been performed between Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) and National Metrology Laboratory, SIRIM (NML-SIRIM), and registered as APMP.EM-S13 in the BIPM key comparison database. This comparison was piloted by KRISS and the results of the NML-SIRIM were linked to those of the CCEM.M-K1 key comparison through KRISS. The mean value of the coil constant and the uncertainty of the mean reported by both laboratories were used in the calculation of the degree of equivalence (DOE).</p><p>Main text.
