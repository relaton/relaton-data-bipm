    <p>The international comparisons in the field of earth-level dc magnetic flux density measurements with the participation of six National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and four geomagnetic observatories (GMOs) have been carried out in 2013 and 2014 under the auspices of the Regional Metrology Organization Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). The obtained expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the weighted mean value of correction values does not exceed 0.1 nT in the range of 20 μT to 100 μT, which was one of the main aims of this comparison.
    VNIIM (D I Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology) was the pilot laboratory for this comparison registered in the Key Comparison Data Base (KCDB) under index APMP.EM-S14.</p><p>Main text.
