    <p>This report describes the EURAMET comparison for luminous intensity carried out at 16 participating national metrology laboratories (NMIs).</p><p>More than a decade ago, the CCPR initialised a key comparison for luminous intensity denoted as CCPR-K3.a. The reference value CCPR-KCRV for luminous intensity has been maintained since that time by the participants of that early CCPR comparison. Beside the pilot laboratory, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), two additional former participants acted as link laboratories for this EURAMET Key Comparison. The luminous intensity CCPR-KCRV, maintained at the link laboratories and transferred by batches of incandescent lamps, was used to evaluate a reference value (EURAMET-RV) at the pilot laboratory as a weighted luminous intensity average for this comparison.</p><p>Finally, the realized or preserved luminous intensity values of all other participants were compared with the EURAMET-RV in a star-type comparison at the pilot with batches of three to eight lamps of various types. The DOEs of the values of the participants with respect to the reference value and mutually with all other luminous intensity values are evaluated and published in the report together with the associated uncertainties. The deviations from the EURAMET-RV and hence from the CCPR-KCRV are within the declared expanded uncertainties for all participants.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
