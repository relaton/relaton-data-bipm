    <p>The CCPR K2.c key comparison of spectral power responsivity of detectors in the ultraviolet spectral range from 200 nm to 400 nm was carried out in the framework of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement by 14 participating national metrology institutes. The key comparison was piloted by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The comparison was carried out through the calibration of sets of transfer detectors. Three types of transfer detectors based on two types of photodiodes have been used to handle probable changes of the spectral responsivity of the detectors in the ultraviolet spectral range. The results of the key comparison in the wavelength range from 200 nm to 240 nm are based on single-element windowless PtSi/n-Si Schottky photodiodes while in the range from 250 nm to 400 nm the results are based on single-element photodiode detectors and three-element reflection trap detectors, both made up of windowless Si pn junction photodiodes. The comparison was organized in a star pattern and conducted in three groups of participants. The report describes the measurements made by the pilot laboratory, summarizes the reports submitted by the participants and describes the data analysis carried out to determine the key comparison reference values and degrees of equivalence.</p><p>Main text.
