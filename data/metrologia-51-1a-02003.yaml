    <p>PTB, BelGIM and VNIIOFI conducted a supplementary comparison on fiber optic power responsivity at 1308.9 nm and 1548.8 nm. The aim of this comparison is to examine the equivalence of the fiber optic power responsivity among participating laboratories and to provide supporting evidence for associated CMC claims in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB).</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
