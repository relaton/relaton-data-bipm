    <p>PTB, BelGIM and VNIIOFI conducted a supplementary comparison on fiber optic power responsivity at 1308.9 nm and 1548.8 nm. The aim of this comparison is to examine the equivalence of the fiber optic power responsivity among participating laboratories and to provide supporting evidence for associated CMC claims in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB).</p>
