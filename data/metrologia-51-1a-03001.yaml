    <p>ROTH+CO. AG (Switzerland) was designated by METAS for participation in the MRA in the field of thermometry. To demonstrate its technical competence, ROTH+CO. AG asked VSL (the Netherlands) for a bilateral comparison of SPRT calibration at the ITS-90 fixed points of Ar, Hg, H<sub>2</sub>O, Ga, In, Sn, Zn and Al. The comparison, designated as EURAMET.T-K3.5, was initiated in February 2013 (with the preparation of the technical protocol) and completed in July 2014 (with the CCT approval of the final report). The results showed a satisfactory degree of equivalence between VSL and ROTH+CO. AG, and were successfully linked to EUROMET.T-K3 and CCT-K3 key comparisons. As a consequence, ROTH+CO. AG is now able to support CMCs for the services covered by this comparison and publish them in the KCDB.</p><p>Main text.
