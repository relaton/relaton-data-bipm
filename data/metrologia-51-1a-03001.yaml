    <p>ROTH+CO. AG (Switzerland) was designated by METAS for participation in the MRA in the field of thermometry. To demonstrate its technical competence, ROTH+CO. AG asked VSL (the Netherlands) for a bilateral comparison of SPRT calibration at the ITS-90 fixed points of Ar, Hg, H<sub>2</sub>O, Ga, In, Sn, Zn and Al. The comparison, designated as EURAMET.T-K3.5, was initiated in February 2013 (with the preparation of the technical protocol) and completed in July 2014 (with the CCT approval of the final report). The results showed a satisfactory degree of equivalence between VSL and ROTH+CO. AG, and were successfully linked to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/44/1A/03001">EUROMET.T-K3</ext-link> and      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/39/2/7">CCT-K3</ext-link> key comparisons. As a consequence, ROTH+CO. AG is now able to support CMCs for the services covered by this comparison and publish them in the KCDB.</p>
