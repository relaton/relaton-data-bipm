    <p>At its meeting in 2007, the EURAMET TCâ€“Length decided to run an intercomparison of involute gear standards as a regional comparison with non-European involvement. The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig und Berlin, Germany (PTB) was identified as the pilot laboratory, responsible for planning, organizing and analyzing the comparison. In all, seven participants from China, Germany, Japan, Thailand, Ukraine, United Kingdom and USA were asked to measure three different gear standards specialized for profile, helix and pitch measurements. The measurements started mid 2008 and were finished at the end of 2010.</p>
