    <p>The results of the APMP key comparisons on ball plate and hole plate (APMP.L-K6.2007) are reported. Both transfer standards were provided by NMIJ, Japan. The ball plate standard is 532 mm by 532 mm in nominal dimension and 25 spheres are embedded. Thirteen National Metrology Institutes (8 from APMP, 5 from other Regional Metrology Organizations) participated in the ball plate measurement comparison. The hole plate standard is 550 mm by 550 mm in  nominal dimension and there are 44 cylindrical holes in it. Nine National Metrology Institutes (5 from APMP, 4 from other Regional Metrology Organizations) participated in the hole plate measurement comparison. The comparison started in May 2006 and finished in October 2008. The participants used different measurement techniques which were used for their routine calibration services. For determining the key comparison reference values, a two-dimensional coordinates-based analysis was performed. The measurement results on the ball plate show good agreement in ten out of thirteen participants. In contrast, those on the hole plate are in agreement for five out of nine participants.</p><p>Main text.
