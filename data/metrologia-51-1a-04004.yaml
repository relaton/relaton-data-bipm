    <p>A regional key comparison, APMP.L-K4, was held in 2008. To demonstrate the equivalence of routine calibration services offered by NMIs to clients, participants in this APMP.L-K4 comparison agreed to use the same apparatus and methods as routinely applied to client gauges.</p>
    <p>There are 14 laboratories from NMIs involved this key comparison, which included CMS/ITRI, NMIJ/AIST, NPL-I, NIMT, Puslit KIM-LIPI, NMISA, MSL, NMIA, NML-SIRIM, VMI, KRISS, SCL, NMC/A*STAR and NSCL.</p>
    <p>This report describes the measurement results of five diameter standards including two rings and three plugs. The calibrations of this key comparison were carried out by laboratories during the period from May 2008 to November 2010.</p>
