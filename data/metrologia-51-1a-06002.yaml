abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Two new participations in the comparison BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Lu-177 have been added to the previous results and this has produced a revised value for the key comparison reference value (KCRV), calculated using the power-moderated weighted mean. A link has been made to the comparison CCRI(II)-K2.Lu-177 held in 2009 through the NPL and IRMM who participated in both comparisons. Two NMIs used the K2 comparison to update their degree of equivalence. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the International Reference System (SIR) and the KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table for the remaining two NMIs in the comparison BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Lu-177 and the nine other participants in the comparison CCRI(II)-K2.Lu-177. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
