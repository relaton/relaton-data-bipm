abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A bilateral comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the IAEA and the VNIIM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the stated standard uncertainty for the comparison of 4.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for a transfer chamber, is expressed as a ratio of the IAEA and the VNIIM standards for air kerma, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
