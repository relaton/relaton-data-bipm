    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the VSL, Netherlands and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results for the direct comparison show the standards to be in general agreement for the 10 kV, 30 kV and 25 kV radiation qualities at the level of the expanded uncertainty for the comparison of 6.6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. For the 50 kV qualities, differences approaching twice the expanded uncertainty are observed. The results for an indirect comparison made at the same time are not consistent with the direct results, in the worst case (10 kV) differing by 4 parts in 10<sup>2</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database. </p>
