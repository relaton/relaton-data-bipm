- content: |-
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the PTB, Germany and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 2.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.
