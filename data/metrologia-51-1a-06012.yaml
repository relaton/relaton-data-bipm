abstract:
- content: "<p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the \nPhysikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in March
    2014. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the PTB and the BIPM standards
    for air kerma, is 1.0036 with a combined standard uncertainty of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.
    The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for
    entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.\nTo reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
