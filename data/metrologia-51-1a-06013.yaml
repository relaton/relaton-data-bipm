- content: |-
    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co and<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation protection-level beams of the BIPM in September 2011. The comparison results, based on the calibration coefficient for two transfer standards and expressed as a ratio of the NIST and the BIPM standards for air kerma, are 1.0023 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> in<sup>60</sup>Co, and 0.9990 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup> in<sup>137</sup>Cs.</p><p>The result in the<sup>60</sup>Co beam for radiation protection agrees within the uncertainties with the result of the comparison carried out at the same time in the CIS Bio<sup>60</sup>Co beam for radiotherapy-level air kerma.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
