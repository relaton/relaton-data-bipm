abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>In 2013, a comparison of activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the Institutul National de Cercetare – Dezvoltare in Fizica si Inginerie Nucleara – 'Horia Hulubei' (IFIN-HH, Romania). Ampoules containing about 21 kBq and 40 kBq of a<sup>99m</sup>Tc solution were measured in the SIRTI for, respectively, one and three half-lives. The comparison, identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m, is linked to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparison and the degrees of equivalence with the key comparison reference value and between the present IFIN-HH result, the other K4 participants and the six participants in the K1 comparison have been evaluated.</p><p>Main text.
