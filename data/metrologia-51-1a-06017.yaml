abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Since 2009, three national metrology institutes (NMI) have submitted three samples of known activity of<sup>133</sup>Ba to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133, to update their earlier result dating more than 15 years ago. The values of the activity submitted were between about 2 MBq and 3 MBq. There are now nine results in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133 comparison. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
