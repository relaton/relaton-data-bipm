  content: "<p>Detailed uncertainty reporting is imperative for proficiency tests
    and comparison exercises because uncertainties need to be comparable and trusted
    by all the participants. Even though participants do their best to follow the
    <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>, ambiguities
    and divergences about uncertainty evaluation remain. Consequently, to analyze
    the situation, the CCRI (II) Uncertainties Working Group proposed a comparison
    exercise (CCRI(II)-S7) about the uncertainty evaluation of a relatively simple
    primary activity measurement: the standardization of a <sup>60</sup>Co source
    by coincidence counting.</p>\n<p>\nTo be able to understand how various NMIs calculate
    coincidence counting uncertainties, our study focused on two of the dominant uncertainty
    components commonly quoted for 4πβ-γ coincidence counting in the International
    Reference System (SIR) submissions and Key Comparison exercises: efficiency-extrapolation
    and weighing. Participants from twelve different laboratories were sent the same
    set of measurement data from the analysis of a <sup>60</sup>Co solution standardized
    at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). </p>\n<p>\nOur study demonstrated the
    extent of the different interpretations of the uncertainty components. Some factors
    causing large discrepancies were isolated and are discussed. Further studies of
    other techniques using a similar approach would be beneficial for the metrology
    community.  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this
