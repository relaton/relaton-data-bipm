  content: "<p>An indirect comparison was performed between nine national standards
    for air kerma for the CCRI radiation qualities from 10 kV to 50 kV (APMP.RI(I)-K2)
    and for the ISO 4037 narrow spectrum series (15 kV and 40 kV). Among the nine
    institutes that participated in the comparison, seven institutes were APMP member
    laboratories. Three commercially available thin window parallel plate ionization
    chambers were used as transfer instruments and circulated among the participants.
    The pilot laboratory, the NMIJ/AIST, served also as the link to the corresponding
    BIPM.RI(I)-K2 comparison. The results show general agreement within the combined
    uncertainties, although certain results for Nuclear Malaysia, the BARC and the
    OAP show larger differences.  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the
