    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for reference air kerma rate for<sup>192</sup>Ir high dose rate brachytherapy sources of the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), The Netherlands, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out at the VSL in November 2009. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for a transfer standard and expressed as a ratio of the VSL and the BIPM standards for reference air kerma rate, is 0.9873 with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0061.</p><p>Main text.
