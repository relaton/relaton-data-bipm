  content: "<p>Neutron reference fields in the energy range above 15 MeV are produced
    using the T(d,n)<sup>4</sup>He reaction and solid-state Ti(T) targets. The potential
    presence of non-monoenergetic neutrons from parasitic (d,n) reactions induced
    in the target materials makes this energy range particularly challenging for reference
    instruments which cannot discriminate the neutron energy, such as long counters
    or activation foils. Therefore, a supplementary comparison was carried out in
    the energy range from 15.5 MeV to 19 MeV involving reference instruments of different
    sensitivities to non-monoenergetic neutrons. The spectral distributions of the
    neutron beams were characterized by time-of-flight measurements and by Monte Carlo
    simulations.  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this
