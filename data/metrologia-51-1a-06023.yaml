- content: |-
    <p>Neutron reference fields in the energy range above 15 MeV are produced using the T(d,n)<sup>4</sup>He reaction and solid-state Ti(T) targets. The potential presence of non-monoenergetic neutrons from parasitic (d,n) reactions induced in the target materials makes this energy range particularly challenging for reference instruments which cannot discriminate the neutron energy, such as long counters or activation foils. Therefore, a supplementary comparison was carried out in the energy range from 15.5 MeV to 19 MeV involving reference instruments of different sensitivities to non-monoenergetic neutrons. The spectral distributions of the neutron beams were characterized by time-of-flight measurements and by Monte Carlo simulations.</p><p>Main text.
