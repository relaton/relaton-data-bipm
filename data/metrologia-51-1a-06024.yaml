  content: "<p>An indirect comparison of the standards for reference air kerma rate
    for <sup>192</sup>Ir high dose rate brachytherapy sources of the National Physical
    Laboratory (NPL), United Kingdom, and of the Bureau International des Poids et
    Mesures (BIPM) was carried out at the NPL in June 2010. The comparison result,
    based on the calibration coefficients for a transfer standard and expressed as
    a ratio of the NPL and the BIPM standards for reference air kerma rate, is 0.9989
    with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0057. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
