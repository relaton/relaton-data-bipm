  content: "<p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the VSL and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams. The results show the standards
    to be in agreement within the standard uncertainty of 5.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>.
    The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for
    entry in the BIPM key comparison database. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
