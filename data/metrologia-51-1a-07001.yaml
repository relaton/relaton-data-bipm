    <p>A SIM comparison was performed in the field of calibration of testing machines. This comparison is registered in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB) as supplementary comparison SIM.M.F-S1. It was conducted among 13 participants and IDIC (Chile) was the Pilot laboratory for this exercise.</p>
    <p>The final report lists all the measurement results and declared uncertainties as obtained by the participating NMIs, as well as degrees of equivalence and levels of measurement agreement.</p>
