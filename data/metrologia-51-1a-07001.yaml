    <p>A SIM comparison was performed in the field of calibration of testing machines. This comparison is registered in the BIPM key comparison database (KCDB) as supplementary comparison SIM.M.F-S1. It was conducted among 13 participants and IDIC (Chile) was the Pilot laboratory for this exercise.</p><p>The final report lists all the measurement results and declared uncertainties as obtained by the participating NMIs, as well as degrees of equivalence and levels of measurement agreement.</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by SIM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
