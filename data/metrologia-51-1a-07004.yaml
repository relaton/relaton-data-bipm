    <p>The comparison CCM.FF-K6.2011 was organized for the purpose of determination of the degree of equivalence of the national standards for low-pressure gas flow measurement over the range (2 to 100) m<sup>3</sup>/h. A rotary gas meter was used as a transfer standard. The measurements were provided at prescribed reference conditions. Eleven laboratories from four RMOs participated in this key comparison—EURAMET: PTB, Germany; SMU, Slovakia; LNE-LADG, France; SIM: NIST, USA; CENAM, Mexico; APMP: NMIJ AIST Japan; KRISS, Korea; NMI, Australia; NIM, China; CMS, Chinese Taipei; COOMET: GP GP Ivano-Frankivs'kstandart-metrologia, Ukraine and all participants reported independent traceability chains to the SI. All results were used in the determination of the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and the uncertainty of the KCRV. The reference value was determined at each flow separately following procedure A presented by M G Cox. The degree of equivalence with the KCRV was also calculated for each flow and laboratory. All reported results were consistent with the KCRV. This KCRV can now be used in the further regional comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
