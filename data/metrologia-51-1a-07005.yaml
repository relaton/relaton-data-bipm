- content: |-
    <p>This report describes the bilateral key comparison CCM.P-K3.1 between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) for absolute pressure in the range from 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa to 9 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa.  This comparison was a follow-up to the comparison CCM.P-K3.  Two ionization gauges and two spinning rotor gauges (SRGs) were used as the transfer standards for the comparison.  The SRGs were used to compare the standards at a pressure of 9 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa and to normalize the ionization gauge readings.  The two ionization gauges were used to compare the standards in the pressure range of from 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> Pa to 3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa.  Both laboratories used dynamic expansion chambers as standards in the comparison.  The two labs showed excellent agreement with each other and with the CCM.P-K3 key comparison reference value (KCRV) over the entire range.</p><p>Main text.
