    <p>The scope of the comparison is the demonstration of the coherency of the calibration of 200 mg, 1 g, 50 g, 200 g, 1 kg and 2 kg stainless steel mass standard weights as realized by the participating institutes: CEM (pilot), CEHM, CENAME, CENAMEP, CIM, LACOMET and LANAMET.</p><p>This comparison is based on a decision taken on 27 August 2013 as part of the program PRACAMS (Regional Program for Quality Support and Implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures in Central America).</p><p>Each participating NMI determined the true mass and conventional mass of 200 mg, 1 g, 50 g, 200 g, 1 kg and 2 kg stainless steel mass standard weights.</p><p>Main text.
