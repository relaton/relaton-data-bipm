    <p>This report describes a key comparison of 1 kg stainless steel mass standards, CCM.M-K4, undertaken by the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) Working Group on the Dissemination of the kilogram (WGD-kg). The CCM.M-K4 comparison was launched during the 12th meeting of the CCM (2010). The aim of the present comparison is to verify the consistency of 1 kg stainless steel mass standards among members of the CCM.</p><p>The previous CCM 1 kg stainless steel mass standards comparison was carried out in 1995–1997 as the CCM.M-K1 comparison. The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was the pilot laboratory for this key comparison. There were sixteen participants in the CCM.M-K4 comparison, all are CCM members. The comparison was structured into four petals with two stainless steel travelling mass standards per petal. The measurements and the reported results were completed in between one month and five months depending on the participants. One laboratory's results were found to be inconsistent with the other laboratories' results and one other laboratory gave a significant deviation from the key comparison reference value (KCRV). Both laboratories were contacted before preparation of the draft A report, without disclosing the details of the deviations, to allow them to check and revise their values. The fourteen other participants were in agreement with each other and degrees of equivalence have been established.</p><p>Finally, the mass values of the eight stainless steel travelling standards were determined in air by the NMIs with claimed standard uncertainties ranging from 0.007 mg to 0.021 mg. Degrees of equivalence have been established by using the generalized linear least-squares estimation (GLS) method. The result demonstrates the high quality of this comparison and that some participants are able to provide, for their mass calibration services, standard uncertainties of around ten micrograms. The good uniformity of worldwide mass dissemination since the last periodic mass verification carried out in 1992 is demonstrated by the agreement among the NMIs' results. In addition, the observed weighted mean of the NMI deviations against the BIPM is −0.0098 mg (σ = 0.0036 mg). Despite the good result obtained in this particular comparison we should, in order to have a more accurate calibration system, improve the knowledge of the ageing effects of the mass references and increase the BIPM calibration frequency of the national prototypes.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
