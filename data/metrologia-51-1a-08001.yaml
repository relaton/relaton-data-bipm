abstract:
- content: "<p>Nitrogen monoxide is one of the main contaminants present in the atmospheric
    air due to emissions of vehicles and power stations.</p><p>Taking into account
    the positive experience of VNIIM in the pilot study  CCQM-P73  (Nitrogen monoxide
    gas standards, 30 Âµmol/mol to 70 Âµmol/mol), a COOMET project (No 483/RU/09) on
    the subject was decided and registered in the KCDB as supplementary comparison
    COOMET.QM-S1. This involved six National Metrology Institutes, aiming to consolidate
    or support their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities in this field.</p><p>It
    was found that most of the results were consistent with the reference (gravimetric)
    values, with observed differences not exceeding Â±1.3% and not exceeding either
    the appropriate assigned expanded uncertainties. There was, however, one exception:
    the INMETRO difference from the reference value is slightly higher than the expended
    uncertainty.</p><p>The mixtures prepared for this exercise were found to be stable
    during about one year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p><p> Main
