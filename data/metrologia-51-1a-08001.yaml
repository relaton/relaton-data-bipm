    <p>Nitrogen monoxide is one of the main contaminants present in the atmospheric air due to emissions of vehicles and power stations.</p>
    <p>Taking into account the positive experience of VNIIM in the pilot study <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/45/1A/08002">CCQM-P73</ext-link> (Nitrogen monoxide gas standards, 30 µmol/mol to 70 µmol/mol), a COOMET project (No 483/RU/09) on the subject was decided and registered in the KCDB as supplementary comparison COOMET.QM-S1. This involved six National Metrology Institutes, aiming to consolidate or support their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities in this field.</p>
    <p>It was found that most of the results were consistent with the reference (gravimetric) values, with observed differences not exceeding ±1.3% and not exceeding either the appropriate assigned expanded uncertainties. There was, however, one exception: the INMETRO difference from the reference value is slightly higher than the expended uncertainty.</p>
    <p>The mixtures prepared for this exercise were found to be stable during about one year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p>
