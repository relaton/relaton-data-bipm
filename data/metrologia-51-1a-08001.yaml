- content: |-
    <p>Nitrogen monoxide is one of the main contaminants present in the atmospheric air due to emissions of vehicles and power stations.</p><p>Taking into account the positive experience of VNIIM in the pilot study CCQM-P73 (Nitrogen monoxide gas standards, 30 µmol/mol to 70 µmol/mol), a COOMET project (No 483/RU/09) on the subject was decided and registered in the KCDB as supplementary comparison COOMET.QM-S1. This involved six National Metrology Institutes, aiming to consolidate or support their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities in this field.</p><p>It was found that most of the results were consistent with the reference (gravimetric) values, with observed differences not exceeding ±1.3% and not exceeding either the appropriate assigned expanded uncertainties. There was, however, one exception: the INMETRO difference from the reference value is slightly higher than the expended uncertainty.</p><p>The mixtures prepared for this exercise were found to be stable during about one year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by COOMET, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
