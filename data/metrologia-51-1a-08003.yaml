    <p>Sulfur dioxide is one of the main contaminants present in the atmosphere due to burning of coal, oil and natural gas, smelting of base metals and production of sulfuric acid.</p>
    <p>Sulfur dioxide has been the subject of three previous CCQM key comparisons: CCQM-K1.d in 1997, CCQM-K26.b in 2005 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/48/1A/08015">CCQM-K76</ext-link> in 2010. VNIIM proposed a new COOMET project (No 484/RU/09) in this field, which was registered in the KCDB as key comparison COOMET.QM-K76.</p>
    <p>It was found that all results were consistent with the reference (gravimetric) values, with observed differences not exceeding ±0.60% and not exceeding either the appropriate assigned expanded uncertainties.</p>
    <p>VNIIM is the linking laboratory to CCQM-K76.</p>
    <p>SMU has improved the results obtained in CCQM-K76.</p>
    <p>The mixtures prepared for this exercise were found to be stable during about one year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p>
