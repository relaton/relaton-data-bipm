abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Sulfur dioxide is one of the main contaminants present in the atmosphere due to burning of coal, oil and natural gas, smelting of base metals and production of sulfuric acid.</p><p>Sulfur dioxide has been the subject of three previous CCQM key comparisons: CCQM-K1.d in 1997, CCQM-K26.b in 2005 and CCQM-K76 in 2010. VNIIM proposed a new COOMET project (No 484/RU/09) in this field, which was registered in the KCDB as key comparison COOMET.QM-K76.</p><p>It was found that all results were consistent with the reference (gravimetric) values, with observed differences not exceeding ±0.60% and not exceeding either the appropriate assigned expanded uncertainties.</p><p>VNIIM is the linking laboratory to CCQM-K76.</p><p>SMU has improved the results obtained in CCQM-K76.</p><p>The mixtures prepared for this exercise were found to be stable during about one year within the uncertainty of the measurements.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
