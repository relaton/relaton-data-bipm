abstract:
- content: "<p>As part of the on-going key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has
    been performed between the ozone national standard of Singapore maintained by
    the National Metrology Centre, A*STAR (NMC, A*STAR) and the common reference standard
    of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM), via a transfer standard maintained by the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone
    amount-of-substance fraction range of 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol</p><p> Main text.
