- content: |-
    <p>High purity elements can serve as a realization of the SI unit amount of substance for the specific element. Solutions prepared from high purity metals by applying gravimetric preparation and the concept of molar mass are used as 'calibration' solutions in many fields of analytical chemistry and provide the metrological basis in elemental analysis. Since ideal purity does not exist for real materials, the actual purity of the high purity material must be known with a specified uncertainty. As required uncertainties around 10<sup>−4</sup> relative on the purity statement are not accessible in almost all cases by a direct measurement of the element in itself, the indirect approach is followed, where all elements excepting the matrix element itself are measured and their sum is subtracted from the value for ideal purity, which is 1 kg/kg.</p><p>It was the aim of this comparison to demonstrate the capability of national metrology institutes and designated institutes to determine the purity of pure elements. In order to limit the effort within this comparison, only six metallic impurities (Ag, Al, Cd, Cr, Ni, Tl) in the low mg/kg range are considered in a zinc matrix. It has to be underlined here that the task was to measure the purity of zinc based on the determination of six analytes. The task is not trace analysis of specific analytes in zinc. This subtle distinction defines different measurands.</p><p>The sample, pure Zn, was cut in pieces of cubic geometry for wet chemical analysis or of pin geometry for GDMS analysis and was sent to the participants. The comparison was run under the auspices of the Inorganic analysis Working Group (IAWG) of the CCQM and was piloted by the BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Berlin, Germany. The majority of the participants applied ICP-MS techniques and only two participants used additionally atomic absorption spectrometry. GDMS was used only by one participant.</p><p>The observed spreads for the measurement results reported by the participants were significantly lower than those of the preceding study CCQM-P107 and were well below the target uncertainty of 30% relative. As a consequence, comparability within the participating laboratories is demonstrated to be established. The individual measurement results, mean values and medians derived were in all cases very consistent with the reference values obtained by IDMS and so the accuracy of the measurement results for the participating laboratories is as well demonstrated to be established. Especially with the results of CCQM-P62 and CCQM-P107 in mind, the outcome of CCQM-K72 can be considered as a big step forward in the community.</p><p>CCQM is aware of the difference between a characterization based on only six analytes and a complete characterization. Therefore, the pilot study CCQM-P149 has been initiated and already started, which focuses on the fit-for-purpose approaches for the purity determination of metals (here: zinc) to be used as primary standards in elemental analysis. Another follow-up in the form of a pilot study on non-metal impurities is mandatory, because non-metal impurities such as oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur often make up the largest contributions.</p><p>Main text.
