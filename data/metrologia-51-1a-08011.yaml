    <p>This report presents the results of APMP.QM-S4, a supplementary comparison. This comparison is designed to test the capabilities of the NMIs to measure and certify carbon dioxide at a nominal amount fraction of 2000 µmol/mol in nitrogen. The previous key comparisons regarding carbon dioxide, CCQM-K1.b and CCQM-K52, had been done at a lower range than that in this comparison. This comparison gives an opportunity to the NMIs to submit supporting evidence for CMC at a higher range.</p><p>
