    <p>This report presents the results of APMP.QM-K41, a key comparison. This comparison is designed to test the capabilities of the NMIs to measure and certify hydrogen sulfide at a nominal amount fraction of 10 µmol/mol in nitrogen. This comparison provides an opportunity to the NMIs in APMP to submit supporting evidence for CMC at the same level as CCQM-K41. The results from this comparison are linked with CCQM-K41.</p><p>Main text.
