  content: "<p>The increase in renewable sources in the energy matrix of the countries
    is an effort to reduce dependency on crude oil and the environmental impacts associated
    with its use.\nIn order to help overcome the lack of widely accepted quality standards
    for fuel ethanol and to guarantee its competitiveness in the international trade
    market, the NMIs have been working to develop certified reference materials for
    bio-fuels and measurement methods. \nInorganic impurities such as Cu, Na and Fe
    may be present in the fuel ethanol and their presence is associated with corrosion
    and the formation of oxide deposits in some engine parts. \nThe key comparison
    CCQM-K100 was carried out under the auspices of the Inorganic Analysis Working
    Group (IAWG) and the coordination of the National Institute of Metrology, Quality
    and Technology (INMETRO). The objective of this key comparison was to compare
    the measurement capabilities of the participants for the determination of Cu in
    fuel ethanol. \nTen NMIs participated in this exercise and most of them used the
    isotopic dilution method for determining the amount of Cu. \nThe median was chosen
    as key comparison reference value (KCRV). The assigned KCRV for the Cu content
    was 0.3589 µg/g with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0014 µg/g.\nIn general,
    there is a good agreement among the participants' results.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
