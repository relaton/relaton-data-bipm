abstract:
- content: "<p>The growing awareness of climate change/global warming and continuing
    concerns regarding stratospheric ozone depletion will require future measurements
    and standards for many compounds, in particular halocarbons that are linked to
    these issues. In order to track and control the emissions of these species globally
    in the atmosphere, it is necessary to demonstrate measurement equivalence at the
    highest levels of accuracy for assigned values of standards. This report describes
    the results of a pilot study between National Metrology Institutes and atmospheric
    research laboratories for several of the more important halocarbons at atmospheric
    concentration levels. The comparison includes the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) dichlorodifluoromethane
    (CFC 12), trichlorofluoromethane (CFC 11), and 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane
    (CFC 113); the hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC 22)
    and 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC 142b); and the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane
    (HFC 134a), all in a dried whole air sample. The objective of this key comparison
    is to compare the measurement capabilities of the participants for these halocarbons
    at trace atmospheric levels.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this
