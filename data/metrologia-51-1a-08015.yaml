- content: |-
    <p>The EURAMET supplementary comparison EURAMET.QM-S9 involves standard gas mixtures of synthetic natural gas. It is similar to key comparison CCQM-K16 (2001-2002). Analysed were gas mixtures of synthetic natural gas containing nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the alkanes up to hexane with a total of 10 components.</p><p>
    Four laboratories (CMI, Czech Republic; INMETRO, Brazil; SMU, Slovakia; and VSL, The Netherlands) participated in this supplementary comparison. All of the participants, except CMI, have established facilities for natural gas analysis, and have existing claims for their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) for natural gas mixtures.</p><p>
    The agreement of the results in this supplementary comparison is very good. All the results with their reported uncertainties are in agreement with the reference values for all the participants.</p><p>
    SMU and VSL participated in the key comparison CCQM-K16. VSL obtained very good results in both the supplementary comparison and the CCQM-K16 comparison. SMU obtained better results in the supplementary comparison than in CCQM-K16.</p><p>Main text.
