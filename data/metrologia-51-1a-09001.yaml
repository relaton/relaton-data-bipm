    <p>The CCAUV.U-K3 is the third key comparison in the ultrasound branch organised under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the BIPM. It is a follow-up to the first comparison CCAUV.U-K1, which dealt with power measurement in the frequency range 2 to 10.5 MHz and a power range between 10 mW and 15 W. This region is of particular importance for medical applications of ultrasound.</p><p>Main text.
