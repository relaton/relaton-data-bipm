    <p>The CCAUV.U-K3 is the third key comparison in the ultrasound branch organised under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the BIPM. It is a follow-up to the first comparison <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iopscience.iop.org/0026-1394/39/1A/27/">CCAUV.U-K1</ext-link>, which dealt with power measurement in the frequency range 2 to 10.5 MHz and a power range between 10 mW and 15 W. This region is of particular importance for medical applications of ultrasound.</p>
