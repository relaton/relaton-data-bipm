- content: |-
    <p>The results of the third CIPM comparison in the area of vibration, here concerning sinusoidal acceleration, are presented. This comparison was intended to build the foundation for subsequent regional key comparisons over an extended frequency range. However, one of the transducers showed a poor stability. This feature, and other shortcomings that became apparent during the analysis, limit the impact of the comparison results. Therefore, a key comparison reference value has been defined for a limited domain and application, and the respective Degrees of Equivalence are reported.</p><p>Main text.
