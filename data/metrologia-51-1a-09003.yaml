    <p>This is the final report for supplementary comparison AFRIMETS.AUV.V-S3 in the area of vibration (quantity of acceleration). The aim of this comparison was to measure the sensitivity of an accelerometer using secondary means in accordance with ISO 16063-21: 2003 'Vibration calibration by comparison to a reference transducer'. The comparison covered the frequency range from 10 Hz to 10 kHz. Six national metrology institutes from three Regional Metrology Organisations participated in the comparison. The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) acted as pilot with assistance from the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA). Two transfer standards were circulated between the participants in a star configuration. Calibration results in the form of calibration certificates were submitted by each participant. The comparison reference values were obtained by the NMISA using primary means in accordance with ISO 16063-11 'Primary vibration calibration by laser interferometry' and the respective degrees of equivalence were reported. Any correlation between the comparison reference values and the NMISA comparison results is addressed in Appendix A of this report by applying exclusive statistics. With few exceptions, the agreement of calibration results between the participants was satisfactory.</p>
