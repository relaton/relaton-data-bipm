    <p>A regional supplementary comparison APMP.AUV.A-S1 has been carried out for the measurement of sound pressure level, frequency and total distortion of a multi-frequency sound calibrator. The role of the Pilot laboratory was undertaken by the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand) (NIMT). The multi-frequency sound calibrator was circulated through thirteen National Metrology Institutes (NMIs). Two NMIs were added to the original time schedule after starting the circulation. The measurements took place between September 2008 and July 2010. This report includes the measurement results from all the participants. Supplementary Comparison Reference Values (SCRVs) have been determined from the results. Deviations from the SCRVs are mostly within declared expanded uncertainties. It has been found that a term for the inherent instability in this type of device needs to be included in any uncertainty budget, and a recommended minimum value of this has been given.</p><p>Main text.
