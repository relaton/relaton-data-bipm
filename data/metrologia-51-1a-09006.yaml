    <p>A comparison CCAUV.V-S1 was organized to compare measurements of sinusoidal angular accelerations in the frequency range from 0.4 Hz to 1 kHz. This was a bilateral comparison between the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Republic of Korea, and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany.</p>
    <p>Both NMIs applied laser interferometry in compliance with ISO 16063-15:2006 'Methods for the calibration of vibration and shock transducers—Part 15: Primary angular vibration calibration by laser interferometry'.</p>
    <p>The complex voltage sensitivity (magnitude and phase) of one angular transfer standard in the frequency range of 0.4 Hz to 100 Hz and the complex charge sensitivity (magnitude and phase) of one angular reference standard in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1000 Hz were measured.</p>
