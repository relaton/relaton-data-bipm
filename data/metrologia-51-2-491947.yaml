abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The advantage of the joule balance over the classic watt balance
    is that the dynamic measurement in the watt balance is replaced by a static measurement,
    which makes the whole measurement procedure easier. The main problems in the joule
    balance are the precise measurement of mutual inductance and coil heating. These
    problems and recent progress in the development of the joule balance are described
    and discussed in this paper. The whole system is at the stage of being adjusted
    and improved. The principle of the joule balance has been demonstrated by a measurement
    of the Planck constant, h = 6.626 104(59) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s with an 8.9 ppm
    measurement uncertainty.</p>
