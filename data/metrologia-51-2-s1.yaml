abstract:
- content: "<p>The time is fast approaching when the SI unit of mass will cease to
    be based on a single material artefact and will instead be based upon the defined
    value of a fundamental constant—the Planck constant—h. This change requires that
    techniques exist both to determine the appropriate value to be assigned to the
    constant, and to measure mass in terms of the redefined unit. It is important
    to ensure that these techniques are accurate and reliable to allow full advantage
    to be taken of the stability and universality provided by the new definition and
    to guarantee the continuity of the world's mass measurements, which can affect
    the measurement of many other quantities such as energy and force.</p><p>Up to
    now, efforts to provide the basis for such a redefinition of the kilogram were
    mainly concerned with resolving the discrepancies between individual implementations
    of the two principal techniques: the x-ray crystal density (XRCD) method [1] and
    the watt and joule balance methods which are the subject of this special issue.
    The first three papers report results from the NRC and NIST watt balance groups
    and the NIM joule balance group. The result from the NRC (formerly the NPL Mk
    II) watt balance is the first to be reported with a relative standard uncertainty
    below 2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and the NIST result has a relative standard uncertainty
    below 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. Both results are shown in figure 1 along with some
    previous results; the result from the NIM group is not shown on the plot but has
    a relative uncertainty of 8.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup> and is consistent with all the
    results shown. The Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM)
    in its meeting in 2013 produced a resolution [2] which set out the requirements
    for the number, type and quality of results intended to support the redefinition
    of the kilogram and required that there should be agreement between them. These
    results from NRC, NIST and the IAC may be considered to meet these requirements
    and are likely to be widely debated prior to a decision on redefinition. The CCM
    had already recognized that agreement was close and has set in place a process
    whereby redefinition can take place by 2018. The final decision will be in the
    hands of the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) but the results reported
    here should aid a positive decision.</p><p></p><p>Figure 1. Results from recent
    measurements of the Planck constant. The reference for the results h<sub>90</sub>
    is derived from the conventional values of the Josephson constant K<sub>J−90</sub>
    and the von Klitzing constant R<sub>K−90</sub>. The factor of ten improvement
    in uncertainty of the NRC watt balance result, over that achieved by the same
    apparatus at NPL a few years earlier, can be understood as a factor of five improvement
    arising from the elimination of an effect discovered at NPL that could not be
    eliminated before shipment to Canada and a factor of two arising from the considerable
    improvements made by NRC.</p><p>Once the kilogram has been redefined, the watt
    and joule balances will complete their transitions from instruments that are primarily
    of interest to the electrical community for determining the SI electrical units
    from the mechanical units, to the principal methods by which an individual National
    Measurement Institute (NMI) can make an independent determination of the SI unit
    of mass and thereby contribute to the maintenance of national and international
    mass scales.</p><p>This special issue gives an introduction to the diversity of
    techniques which are required for the operation of watt and joule balances. However
    it does not contain a review of existing balances; this was a deliberate decision,
    as a number of such review papers have been published in the past five years [3–7]
    and it was felt that it was not yet time for another.</p><p>The first technique
    considered is that of gravimetry; the watt balance measures the weight Mg  of
    a mass M, and to convert the measured weight into a mass, the value of the acceleration
    due to gravity g  must be known, at the time of the weighing and at the centre
    of gravity of the mass. The paper by Liard and his co-authors at NRC describes
    how they have made this essential measurement.</p><p>The accuracy of the watt
    balance may also depend on the alignment of the apparatus. Two papers deal with
    this important issue. The first, by Sanchez and his co-authors at NRC, shows that
    their balance is insensitive to a range of alignments and concentrates on the
    essential alignments that contribute directly to the overall uncertainty of the
    apparatus. Thomas and his co-authors at LNE describe their technique for reducing
    uncertainties in their watt balance by aligning its coil in the field of the magnet
    to minimize both horizontal forces and torques about horizontal axes.</p><p>The
    search for discrepancies between the results from watt balances has encouraged
    researchers to consider possible error mechanisms arising from the secondary electrical
    interactions between the coil of a watt balance and other parts of the apparatus.
    Researchers from INRIM have two such papers: one considering magnetic interactions
    and the other considering electrostatic interactions. It is essential that such
    investigations are carried out: both to prove that the problems are understood
    and for the guidance of those building the next generation of watt and joule balances.</p><p>The
    next four papers describe aspects of the construction of watt balances.</p><p>The
    BIPM watt balance group describe the principles behind their simultaneous measurement
    scheme for a watt balance. The balance that they are constructing can also be
    used in the conventional two-phase mode and their paper describes the relative
    advantages and disadvantages of the two modes of operation.</p><p>In a watt balance
    there are some advantages to precise vertical movement of the coil. The METAS
    group describe the two mechanisms that they have tested to achieve such motion
    and give the reasons for the choice of mechanism for use in the balance that they
    are constructing.</p><p>The KRISS watt balance group are in the initial phases
    of the design and construction of a watt balance and their paper provides valuable
    information on the design that they are building.</p><p>The design of the main
    magnet of a watt balance is critical to its successful operation, and an important
    assumption of watt balance operation is that the field of the magnet in moving
    mode is equivalent to that in weighing mode. Sutton and Clarkson from MSL describe
    a novel magnet which is designed to address this issue.</p><p>The international
    prototype of the kilogram is kept in air but, after redefinition, the best realizations
    of the mass unit will be in vacuum. In their paper Berry and Davidson from NPL
    describe progress in techniques which relate mass measured in vacuum to that measured
    in air. Such techniques will be essential for making the results of watt and joule
    balance measurements available to science and industry.</p><p>Both the NIST and
    NPL Mark II (NRC) watt balances use knife edges to act as the pivots for the beam.
    Knife edges suffer from hysteresis which can produce systematic offsets during
    weighing. In their paper Choi (KRISS) and Robinson (NPL) describe the analysis
    of this problem using both finite element (FEM) techniques and a stand-alone balance
    designed for testing knife edges.</p><p>The last two papers deal with the possible
    future of the watt balance technique.</p><p>The BIPM simultaneous measurement
    scheme for the watt balance was originally conceived for operation at cryogenic
    temperatures with a superconducting coil. In their paper de Mirandes and her co-authors
    describe initial work on the principles of this superconducting variant of the
    BIPM watt balance and concentrate on the characteristics of the superconducting
    coil in comparison with those of a normal coil.</p><p>The final paper is a good
    example of serendipity in which Kibble (Independent Consultant) was designing
    novel watt balances based on seismometer suspensions and Robinson (NPL) had derived
    a set of general expressions, which are required for a watt balance to be immune
    to a range of common misalignments but also lead to the design of watt balances
    with a range of coil motions. The combination of these techniques has led to the
    novel watt balance designs which are described.</p><p>Finally I would like to
    thank: the editor of Metrologia  and the editorial staff of IOP Publishing, the
    referees who have responded rapidly to requests and have kept the issue on schedule,
    and the authors who have taken the time to provide a range of papers showing the
    breadth of the work required to build and operate watt or joule balances.</p><p>References</p><p>[1]
