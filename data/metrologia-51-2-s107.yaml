    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper reports work undertaken to evaluate the change in mass of platinum/iridium, stainless steel and silicon artefacts measured at atmospheric pressure and in vacuum at a range of pressures typical of those used in vacuum mass comparators and watt balances and for x-ray crystal density (XRCD) measurements. The sets of platinum/iridium, stainless steel and silicon artefacts used in this work have different surface areas and the effect of transferring them between atmospheric pressure and different levels of vacuum was evaluated by measuring the relative changes in mass between them.</p>
    <p>Reversible variations in the mass differences between the artefacts were found over the pressure range from 0.1 Pa to 100 000 Pa (atmospheric pressure). At lower pressures (0.001 Pa to 0.1 Pa) the mass differences between all the artefacts were stable and no evidence for hysteresis over this range was found when going down in pressure compared with increasing pressure. Therefore consistent results between watt balance, XRCD measurements and vacuum mass measurements can be realized providing the measurements are performed within this pressure range.</p>
