abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper reports work undertaken to evaluate the change in
    mass of platinum/iridium, stainless steel and silicon artefacts measured at atmospheric
    pressure and in vacuum at a range of pressures typical of those used in vacuum
    mass comparators and watt balances and for x-ray crystal density (XRCD) measurements.
    The sets of platinum/iridium, stainless steel and silicon artefacts used in this
    work have different surface areas and the effect of transferring them between
    atmospheric pressure and different levels of vacuum was evaluated by measuring
    the relative changes in mass between them.</p><p>Reversible variations in the
    mass differences between the artefacts were found over the pressure range from
    0.1 Pa to 100 000 Pa (atmospheric pressure). At lower pressures (0.001 Pa to 0.1 Pa)
    the mass differences between all the artefacts were stable and no evidence for
    hysteresis over this range was found when going down in pressure compared with
    increasing pressure. Therefore consistent results between watt balance, XRCD measurements
    and vacuum mass measurements can be realized providing the measurements are performed
    within this pressure range.</p>
