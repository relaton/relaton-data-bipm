abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The BIPM has built an experimental setup dedicated to the study
    of the physical behaviour of a superconducting coil during the dynamic phase of
    a watt balance experiment. We have compared it with the behaviour of a normal
    conducting coil. First experimental results are presented and preliminary conclusions
    are drawn.</p>
