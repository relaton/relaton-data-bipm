    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The BIPM has built an experimental setup dedicated to the study of the physical behaviour of a superconducting coil during the dynamic phase of a watt balance experiment. We have compared it with the behaviour of a normal conducting coil. First experimental results are presented and preliminary conclusions are drawn.</p>
