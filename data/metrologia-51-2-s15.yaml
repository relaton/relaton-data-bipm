abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the past two years, measurements have been performed with
    a watt balance at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to
    determine the Planck constant. A detailed analysis of these measurements and their
    uncertainties has led to the value h = 6.626 069 79(30) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s.
    The relative standard uncertainty is 45 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. This result is 141 × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    fractionally higher than h<sub>90</sub>. Here h<sub>90</sub> is the conventional
    value of the Planck constant given by, where K<sub>J-90</sub> and R<sub>K-90</sub>
    denote the conventional values of the Josephson and von Klitzing constants, respectively.</p>
