  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>For the past two years, measurements have
    been performed with a watt balance at the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST) to determine the Planck constant. A detailed analysis of these
    measurements and their uncertainties has led to the value <italic>h</italic> = 6.626 069 79(30) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s.
    The relative standard uncertainty is 45 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. This result is 141 × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    fractionally higher than <italic>h</italic><sub>90</sub>. Here <italic>h</italic><sub>90</sub>
    is the conventional value of the Planck constant given by \n<inline-formula>\n<tex-math><?CDATA
    $h_{90}\\equiv 4 /( K_{{\\rm J\\mbox{-}90}}^2R_{{\\rm K\\mbox{-}90}})$ ></tex-math>\n<inline-graphic
    xlink:href=\"metro491226ieqn001.gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\"></inline-graphic>\n</inline-formula>,
    where <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>K-90</sub>
    denote the conventional values of the Josephson and von Klitzing constants, respectively.</p>\n"
