    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The advantage of the joule balance over the classic watt balance is that the dynamic measurement in the watt balance is replaced by a static measurement, which makes the whole measurement procedure easier. The main problems in the joule balance are the precise measurement of mutual inductance and coil heating. These problems and recent progress in the development of the joule balance are described and discussed in this paper. The whole system is at the stage of being adjusted and improved. The principle of the joule balance has been demonstrated by a measurement of the Planck constant, <italic>h</italic> = 6.626 104(59) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s with an 8.9 ppm measurement uncertainty.</p>
