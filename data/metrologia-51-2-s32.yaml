abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In a watt balance (WB) the gravity on a known mass is used in
    the determination of the value of the Planck constant with a precision of &lt;2 × 10<sup>−41</sup> J s.
    To attain this precision the gravity value at the centre of a mass within the
    WB must be known with a relative uncertainty of &lt;1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>. This
    necessitates laboratory gravity mapping in three dimensions, the establishment
    close to the WB of a gravity reference station, and modelling of the ties to the
    centre-of-mass location. The self-gravity of the WB must be accounted for, and
    since WB measurements run over several weeks, corrections for tidal, polar motion
    and atmospheric effects must be included. We describe the gravimetry carried out
    at the National Research Council of Canada WB laboratory, and include a discussion
    of past gravity variations in the vicinity of the WB, which suggest that seasonal
    variation may be of sufficient magnitude to affect results obtained with the balance.</p>
