abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the alignment
    uncertainties in the NRC watt balance. We show that, due to the use of a beam
    balance in both phases of the experiment, some of the alignment errors of the
    weighing phase are correlated with errors in the moving phase, which makes our
    watt balance insensitive to some forms of misalignment. These correlations become
    inexact in the presence of parasitic forces acting on the coil former. We present
    evidence of such forces and estimate their effect and contribution to the various
    uncertainty components. Finally we describe the techniques used to align the apparatus
    and we give an estimate of all relevant alignment uncertainty components.</p>
