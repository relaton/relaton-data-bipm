abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have measured Planck's constant and have obtained a value
    of 6.626 070 34(12) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s. To our knowledge this measurement
    of h has the lowest uncertainty reported to date. This result has been obtained
    from measurements of four masses of different material and nominal values varying
    from 1 kg to 250 g. The experimental procedures and the measurement uncertainties
    are described in detail.</p>
