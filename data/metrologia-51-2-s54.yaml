abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Alignments of watt balance experiments are necessary to achieve
    a relative uncertainty at a level of few parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. This paper briefly
    describes the LNE watt balance and concentrates on adjustments made to minimize
    the coil movements during weighing mode. The parasitic forces and torques involved
    in these movements are estimated by a mathematical model. Some of the calculated
    parasitic forces are compared with an evaluation done by studying the yaw movement
    of the beam.</p>
