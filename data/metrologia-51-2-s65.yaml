abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the watt-balance experiments, separate measurements of the
    magnetic and electromotive forces in a coil in a magnetic field enable a virtual
    comparison between mechanical and electric powers to be carried out, which leads
    to an accurate measurement of the Planck constant. This paper investigates the
    three-dimensional nature of the coilâ€“field interaction and describes the balance
    operation by a continuous three-dimensional model.</p>
