    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the watt-balance experiments, separate measurements of the magnetic and electromotive forces in a coil in a magnetic field enable a virtual comparison between mechanical and electric powers to be carried out, which leads to an accurate measurement of the Planck constant. This paper investigates the three-dimensional nature of the coil–field interaction and describes the balance operation by a continuous three-dimensional model.</p>
