abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In a watt balance, stray capacitances exist between the coil
    and the magnet. Since the electric current flowing in the coil creates a difference
    in electric potentials between the coil and magnet, their electrostatic interactions
    must be taken into account. This paper reports the results of a finite element
    analysis of the forces acting on the coil.</p>
