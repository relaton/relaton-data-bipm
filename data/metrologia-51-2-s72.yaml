    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In a watt balance, stray capacitances exist between the coil and the magnet. Since the electric current flowing in the coil creates a difference in electric potentials between the coil and magnet, their electrostatic interactions must be taken into account. This paper reports the results of a finite element analysis of the forces acting on the coil.</p>
