    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is developing a novel watt balance based on a simultaneous measurement scheme for the forthcoming redefinition of the kilogram. The two distinct measurement phases in a conventional watt balance are carried out in a single phase where all quantities are measured simultaneously. The main characteristics of this simultaneous measurement approach are described. An analysis of the advantages and the drawbacks is carried out.</p>
