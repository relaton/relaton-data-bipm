abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is developing
    a novel watt balance based on a simultaneous measurement scheme for the forthcoming
    redefinition of the kilogram. The two distinct measurement phases in a conventional
    watt balance are carried out in a single phase where all quantities are measured
    simultaneously. The main characteristics of this simultaneous measurement approach
    are described. An analysis of the advantages and the drawbacks is carried out.</p>
