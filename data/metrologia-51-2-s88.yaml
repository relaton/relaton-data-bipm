abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>There is a firm will in the metrology community to redefine
    the kilogram in the International System of units by linking it to a fundamental
    physical constant. The watt balance is a promising way to link the mass unit to
    the Planck constant h. At the Federal Institute of Metrology METAS a second watt
    balance experiment is under development. A decisive part of the METAS Mark II
    watt balance is the mechanical linear guiding system. The present paper discusses
    the development and the metrological characteristics of two guiding systems that
    were conceived by the Laboratoire de Systèmes Robotiques of EPFL and built using
    flexure mechanical elements. Integration in the new setup is also described.</p>
