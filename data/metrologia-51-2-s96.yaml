abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the design of the KRISS watt balance, which includes
    a magnet, a guiding stage and a coil position measurement system. The KRISS watt
    balance incorporates a closed-type cylindrical permanent magnet and a motion guiding
    stage. For the magnet, a flux shunt is used to reduce flux changes due to temperature
    variations. A piston gauge is used to achieve linearity in the motion guiding
    stage. In the weighing mode, the residual force between the weight of the test
    mass and the Lorentz force generated in a coil is measured by a commercial weighing
    cell. In the dynamic mode, a linear motor in the motion guiding stage vertically
    translates the coil and the weighing cell. The in-plane motion of the coil is
    measured by position sensors, and the out-of-plane motion is measured by single-pass
    homodyne interferometers.</p>
