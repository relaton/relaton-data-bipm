abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recent developments are presented in the practical realization
    of IEC 61094-5 on the pressure calibration of working standard microphones. Particular
    emphasis is placed on the simultaneous comparison calibration approach, implemented
    in an open sound field. Limiting factors as well as those having a significant
    influence on the determination of the pressure sensitivity are discussed. These
    include the separation between the microphones, the influence of the test environment
    and location of the sound source, and issues arising from geometric and electroacoustic
    dissimilarities between the reference microphone and the microphone under test.
    Finally, recommendations are given for aspects to be considered in a future revision
    of IEC 61094-5, including contributions to the measurement uncertainty arising
    from the matters discussed.</p>
