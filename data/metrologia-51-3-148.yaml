abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The increase in the bidirectional reflectance distribution
    function around the retro-reflection direction was characterized for four common
    diffuse standard reflectance materials: Spectralon, matte white Russian opal glass,
    matte white ceramic standard and pressed barium sulphate (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) powder.
    The characterized increase or surge is high enough to be considered in low-uncertainty
    reflectance factor measurements, where the values are usually extrapolated around
    that direction due to instrumental limitations. In order to make the corrections
    for this surge, the coherent backscattering of light model and a much simpler
    exponential function were fitted to the measurements.</p>'
