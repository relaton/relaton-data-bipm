abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A novel kind of pycnometer was designed for liquid density measurements
    suitable to be used over wide ranges of temperature and pressure. Two similar
    pycnometers have been manufactured and tested with n-nonane 99.7 mol% in the temperature
    range from 233 K to 313 K at pressure lower than 10 MPa. To validate the procedure,
    the experimental values of density of an n-nonane sample have been compared with
    the density values given in the literature by means of the E<sub>n</sub> number.</p><p>
    The density uncertainty of n-nonane is found to be 0.16 kg m<sup>−3</sup> (0.02%)
    in the temperature range from 253 K to 313 K and lower than 0.07% between 233 K
    and 243 K over the whole pressure range tested.</p>
