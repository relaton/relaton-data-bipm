abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The molar mass of a<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal was measured
    at the National Metrology Institute of Japan to determine the Avogadro constant
    by the x-ray crystal density method as part of the International Avogadro Coordination
    project. The molar mass was determined by isotope ratio measurements using a multicollector
    inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer combined with an isotope dilution
    technique. The<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal was dissolved in tetramethylammonium
    hydroxide and three different blended solutions were used to correct for mass
    bias in the measurement. The molar mass of the<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal
    was determined to be 27.976 970 09 g mol<sup>−1</sup> with a standard uncertainty
    of 0.000 000 14 g mol<sup>−1</sup>. This corresponds to a relative standard uncertainty
    of 5.2 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. This result is consistent with measurements reported
    by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany.</p>
