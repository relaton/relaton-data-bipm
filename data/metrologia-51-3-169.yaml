    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the International System of Units (SI), the definition of the mole sets the value of the molar mass of carbon-12, <italic>M</italic>(<sup>12</sup>C), exactly equal to 0.012 kg mol<sup>−1</sup> whereas the Avogadro constant, <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>, which is the molar number of entities, is measured experimentally. In the proposed ‘new SI’ the principles underlying these relationships will be reversed. However, because the kilogram will also be redefined, the relative uncertainty of the molar mass of carbon-12 will be about 50 times smaller than the present relative uncertainty of <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub>. Critics contend that the mole should not be redefined because a finite uncertainty of <italic>M</italic>(<sup>12</sup>C) would be inconvenient for chemists. This criticism tacitly assumes that mass is conserved in chemical reactions and hence that the equivalent masses of chemical bond energies are negligible. Taking as an example the x-ray crystal density experiment to measure <italic>N</italic><sub>A</sub> by determining the number of atoms in a silicon crystal, we estimate that the mass equivalent of chemical bonds in the crystal is approximately 0.18 µg for a 1 kg crystal. By coincidence, this is approximately equal to the relative uncertainty with which <italic>M</italic>(<sup>12</sup>C) will be known in the new SI. Various implications of this are discussed.</p>
