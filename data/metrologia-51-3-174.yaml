    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report the first accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2, a second-generation laser-cooled caesium fountain primary standard developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a cryogenic (liquid nitrogen) microwave cavity and flight region. The 80 K atom interrogation environment reduces the uncertainty due to the blackbody radiation shift by more than a factor of 50. Also, the Ramsey microwave cavity exhibits a high quality factor (&gt;50 000) at this low temperature, resulting in a reduced distributed cavity phase shift. NIST-F2 has undergone many tests and improvements since we first began operation in 2008. In the last few years NIST-F2 has been compared against a NIST maser time scale and NIST-F1 (the US primary frequency standard) as part of in-house accuracy evaluations. We report the results of nine in-house comparisons since 2010 with a focus on the most recent accuracy evaluation. This paper discusses the design of the physics package, the laser and optics systems and the accuracy evaluation methods. The type B fractional uncertainty of NIST-F2 is shown to be 0.11 × 10<sup>−15</sup> and is dominated by microwave amplitude dependent effects. The most recent evaluation (August 2013) had a statistical (type A) fractional uncertainty of 0.44 × 10<sup>−15</sup>.</p>
