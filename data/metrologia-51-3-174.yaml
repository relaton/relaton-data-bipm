abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the first accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2, a second-generation
    laser-cooled caesium fountain primary standard developed at the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology (NIST) with a cryogenic (liquid nitrogen) microwave
    cavity and flight region. The 80 K atom interrogation environment reduces the
    uncertainty due to the blackbody radiation shift by more than a factor of 50.
    Also, the Ramsey microwave cavity exhibits a high quality factor (&gt;50 000)
    at this low temperature, resulting in a reduced distributed cavity phase shift.
    NIST-F2 has undergone many tests and improvements since we first began operation
    in 2008. In the last few years NIST-F2 has been compared against a NIST maser
    time scale and NIST-F1 (the US primary frequency standard) as part of in-house
    accuracy evaluations. We report the results of nine in-house comparisons since
    2010 with a focus on the most recent accuracy evaluation. This paper discusses
    the design of the physics package, the laser and optics systems and the accuracy
    evaluation methods. The type B fractional uncertainty of NIST-F2 is shown to be
    0.11 × 10<sup>−15</sup> and is dominated by microwave amplitude dependent effects.
    The most recent evaluation (August 2013) had a statistical (type A) fractional
    uncertainty of 0.44 × 10<sup>−15</sup>.</p>
