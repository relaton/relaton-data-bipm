abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An algorithm presented in a previous paper by the authors detects
    frequency anomalies. The algorithm was shown to be effective for early detection
    of weak frequency jumps, and also valid for frequency drift jumps that belong
    to the class of errors that are most difficult to detect. A modification to the
    original frequency jump detector algorithm is suggested by the addition of a noise-removal
    filter. The performance is then compared with the original algorithm and improvement
    is shown. An analysis of real data from a real satellite is also adopted.</p>
