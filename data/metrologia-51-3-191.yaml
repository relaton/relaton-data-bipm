abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper investigates interval estimation for a measurand
    that is known to be positive. Both the Neyman and Bayesian procedures are considered
    and the difference between the two, not always perceived, is discussed in detail.
    A solution is proposed to a paradox originated by the frequentist assessment of
    the long-run success rate of Bayesian intervals.</p>
