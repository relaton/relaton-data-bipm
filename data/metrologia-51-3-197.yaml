abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the design and construction of a new compact room
    temperature predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED). It consists of two
    custom-made induced-junction photodiodes mounted in a wedge trap configuration
    and a window aligned at Brewster's angle for high transmission of p polarized
    light. The window can also be removed, in which case a dry nitrogen flow system
    is utilized to prevent dust contamination of the photodiodes. Measurements of
    individual detectors at the wavelength of 488 nm indicate that reflectance and
    spectral responsivity are consistent within 4 ppm and 13 ppm peak-to-peak variation,
    respectively, and agree with the predicted values. The spatial non-uniformity
    of the responsivity of the PQED is an order of magnitude lower than that of single
    photodiodes. The internal quantum efficiency of the photodiodes is concluded to
    be spatially uniform within 50 ppm. These measurement results—together with the
    responsivity predictable by fundamental laws of physics—provide evidence that
    the room temperature PQED may replace the cryogenic radiometer as a primary standard
    of optical power in the visible wavelength range of 380 nm to 780 nm.</p>
