abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>According to ISO 16063-11 (1999), at frequencies below 1600 Hz
    primary calibration of accelerometers may employ two methods: fringe counting
    or sine approximation. During a recent intercomparison (APMP.AUV.V-S1) small but
    systematic differences were found between the results obtained by using these
    two methods, and by the use of different amplifier modes to drive the shaker at
    frequencies between 0.5 Hz and 20 Hz. The influences of distortion and noise on
    the two methods are explored. The results and a discussion of the differences
    are presented in this paper.</p>'
