abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe the use of a silicon photodiode trap detector and
    digital storage oscilloscope as an absolute laser pulse energy meter, capable
    of repetition rates of 85 Hz and 5% uncertainty (k = 2). The maximum repetition
    rate is limited by the decay time of the output pulse of the detector. The technique
    relies on a straightforward oscilloscope-based integration of the voltage pulse
    generated by the photodiode trap detector. We highlight the versatility of the
    technique by comparing it at 1064 nm with our high and low-level calorimeter based
    pulse energy scales, to which our calibration services are traceable. The good
    agreement of the results, along with comprehensive uncertainty analysis, validates
    the approach we have taken. We have demonstrated a basis for establishing laser
    pulse energy measurement using continuous wave (CW) sources and standard detectors.</p>
