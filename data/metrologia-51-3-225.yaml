    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We describe the use of a silicon photodiode trap detector and digital storage oscilloscope as an absolute laser pulse energy meter, capable of repetition rates of 85 Hz and 5% uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2). The maximum repetition rate is limited by the decay time of the output pulse of the detector. The technique relies on a straightforward oscilloscope-based integration of the voltage pulse generated by the photodiode trap detector. We highlight the versatility of the technique by comparing it at 1064 nm with our high and low-level calorimeter based pulse energy scales, to which our calibration services are traceable. The good agreement of the results, along with comprehensive uncertainty analysis, validates the approach we have taken. We have demonstrated a basis for establishing laser pulse energy measurement using continuous wave (CW) sources and standard detectors.</p>
