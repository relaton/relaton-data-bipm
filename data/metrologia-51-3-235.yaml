    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We present a simple and accurate coaxial bridge capable of measuring the magnetocapacitance and the associated loss factor of a quantum Hall effect device, with and without an external Hall currentâ€”a situation where commercial instruments are limited. We interpret the results in terms of the model of compressible and incompressible regions in the two-dimensional electron gas and we deduce a novel empirical relation between the loss factor and the voltage dependence of the magnetocapacitance. This highlights the reason for the linear voltage dependence of the loss factor whose elimination is the basis for all metrological applications of the quantum Hall resistance at alternating current.</p>
