abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a simple and accurate coaxial bridge capable of measuring
    the magnetocapacitance and the associated loss factor of a quantum Hall effect
    device, with and without an external Hall currentâ€”a situation where commercial
    instruments are limited. We interpret the results in terms of the model of compressible
    and incompressible regions in the two-dimensional electron gas and we deduce a
    novel empirical relation between the loss factor and the voltage dependence of
    the magnetocapacitance. This highlights the reason for the linear voltage dependence
    of the loss factor whose elimination is the basis for all metrological applications
    of the quantum Hall resistance at alternating current.</p>
