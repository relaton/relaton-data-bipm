abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’
    (GUM) requires that the way a measurement uncertainty is expressed should be transferable.
    It should be possible to use directly the uncertainty evaluated for one measurement
    as a component in evaluating the uncertainty for another measurement that depends
    on the first. Although the method for uncertainty evaluation described in the
    GUM meets this requirement of transferability, it is less clear how this requirement
    is to be achieved when GUM Supplement 1 is applied. That Supplement uses a Monte
    Carlo method to provide a sample composed of many values drawn randomly from the
    probability distribution for the measurand. Such a sample does not constitute
    a convenient way of communicating knowledge about the measurand. In this paper
    consideration is given to obtaining a more compact summary of such a sample that
    preserves information about the measurand contained in the sample and can be used
    in a subsequent uncertainty evaluation. In particular, a coverage interval for
    the measurand that corresponds to a given coverage probability is often required.
    If the measurand is characterized by a probability distribution that is not close
    to being Gaussian, sufficient information has to be conveyed to enable such a
    coverage interval to be computed reliably.</p><p>A quantile function in the form
    of an extended lambda distribution can provide adequate approximations in a number
    of cases. This distribution is defined by a fixed number of adjustable parameters
    determined, for example, by matching the moments of the distribution to those
    calculated in terms of the sample of values. In this paper, alternative flexible
    models for the quantile function and methods for determining a quantile function
    from a sample of values are proposed for meeting the above needs.</p>
