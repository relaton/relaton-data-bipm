abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we report that carrier-phase two-way satellite
    time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) was successfully demonstrated over a very
    long baseline of 9000 km, established between the National Institute of Information
    and Communications Technology (NICT) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB). We verified that the carrier-phase TWSTFT (TWCP) result agreed with those
    obtained by conventional TWSTFT and GPS carrier-phase (GPSCP) techniques. Moreover,
    a much improved short-term instability for frequency transfer of 2 × 10<sup>−13</sup>
    at 1 s was achieved, which is at the same level as previously confirmed over a
    shorter baseline within Japan. The precision achieved was so high that the effects
    of ionospheric delay became significant; they are ignored in conventional TWSTFT
    even over a long link. We compensated for these effects using ionospheric delays
    computed from regional vertical total electron content maps. The agreement between
    the TWCP and GPSCP results was improved because of this compensation.</p>
