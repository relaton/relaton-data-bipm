abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An ensemble of rubidium atomic fountain clocks has been put
    into operation at the US Naval Observatory (USNO). These fountains are used as
    continuous clocks in the manner of commercial caesium beams and hydrogen masers
    for the purpose of improved timing applications. Four fountains have been in operation
    for more than two years and are included in the ensemble used to generate the
    USNO master clock. Individual fountain performance is characterized by a white-frequency
    noise level below 2 × 10<sup>−13</sup> and fractional-frequency stability routinely
    reaching the low 10<sup>−16</sup> s. The highest performing pair of fountains
    exhibits stability consistent with each fountain integrating as white frequency
    noise, with Allan deviation surpassing 6 × 10<sup>−17</sup> at 10<sup>7</sup> s,
    and with no relative drift between the fountains at the level of 7.5 × 10<sup>−19</sup>/day.
    As an ensemble, the fountains generate a timescale with white-frequency noise
    level of 1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> and long-term frequency stability consistent with
    zero drift relative to the world's primary standards at 1 × 10<sup>−18</sup>/day.
    The rubidium fountains are reported to the BIPM as continuously running clocks,
    as opposed to secondary standards, the only cold-atom clocks so reported. Here
    we further characterize the performance of the individual fountains and the ensemble
    during the first two years in an operational environment, presenting the first
    look at long-term continuous behavior of fountain clocks.</p>
