abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For almost two decades, caesium fountain primary frequency standards
    (PFS) have represented the best realization of the definition of the second in
    the International System of units. Their accuracy has progressively improved with
    time, reaching a few parts in 10<sup>16</sup>. In this paper, we present the accuracy
    evaluation of ITCsF2, the new Cs fountain PFS developed at the Italian National
    Metrological Institute, designed to be operated at cryogenic temperature to reduce
    the blackbody radiation shift. The short-term stability of the ITCsF2 fountain
    is 2 × 10<sup>−13</sup>τ<sup>−1/2</sup> when operated at high atomic density,
    and the relative inaccuracy reaches 2.3 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. We also report four
    calibrations of International Atomic Time with a relative frequency agreement
    of (−1.7 ± 3.2) × 10<sup>−16</sup>, between ITCsF2 and the average of the other
    fountains operated in the world during the reference periods.</p>
