abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we present a new weighting algorithm for the generation
    of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The new weighting procedure is based on the
    idea that the best clocks are the most predictable. The effect of the new algorithm
    on the weight distribution and on the stability of UTC is presented and discussed.
    An improvement in the frequency stability of UTC at both short and long terms
    is observed, as well as a better clock weight distribution in the ensemble.</p>
