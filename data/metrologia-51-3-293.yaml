abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The concentration of nanometre-sized particles is frequently
    measured in terms of particle number concentration using well-established measuring
    instruments, e.g. condensation particle counters. Traceability for these measurements
    can be achieved by means of calibrations using an aerosol electrometer (AE) as
    a reference. A number of national metrology institutes (NMIs) and expert laboratories
    provide such calibrations, but the metrological basis is at present not well established
    because the equivalence between the unit realizations has not been investigated
    by means of an inter-laboratory comparison. This paper presents the results of
    the first comprehensive comparison of AEs involving NMIs and expert laboratories
    worldwide. The comparison covered the particle size and charge concentrations
    ranges 20 nm to 200 nm and 0.16 × 10<sup>−15</sup> C cm<sup>−3</sup> to 2.72 × 10<sup>−15</sup> C cm<sup>−3</sup>
    (equivalent to 1000 cm<sup>−3</sup> to 17 000 cm<sup>−3</sup> singly charged particles),
    respectively. The obtained results agreed to within about ±3%, which was within
    stated uncertainties, with only a few exceptions, such as at low concentrations.
    Additional measurements with sub-20 nm particles show that comparisons in this
    size range are more challenging and require special considerations, though agreement
    to within about ±5% was still found with 6 nm particles. This comparison is the
    first and vital step towards internationally recognized SI traceability in particle
    number concentration measurements.</p>
