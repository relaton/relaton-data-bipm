abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measurement procedures of most rise-and-fall absolute gravimeters
    have to resolve singularity at the apex of the trajectory caused by the discrete
    fringe counting in the Michelson-type interferometers. Traditionally the singularity
    is addressed by implementing non-linear models of the trajectory, but they introduce
    problems of their own, such as bias, non-uniqueness, and instability of the gravity
    estimates. Using the IMGC-02 gravimeter as an example, we show that the measurement
    procedure of the rise-and-fall gravimeters can be based on linear models which
    successfully resolve the singularity and provide rigorous estimates of the gravity
    value. The linear models also facilitate further enhancements of the instrument,
    such as accounting for new types of disturbances and active compensation for vibrations.</p>
