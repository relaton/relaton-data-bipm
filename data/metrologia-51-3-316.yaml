abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Radiometrically characterizing a camera means relating the response
    of every pixel of the camera to the radiance emitted by a light source. In order
    to accomplish this task, not only the responsivities of the pixels have to be
    characterized, but, in addition, their non-ideal response (dark response or non-linearity)
    or the radiant flux impinging on the pixel from outside its corresponding viewing
    solid angle. An extended uniform source developed at the PTB was used to spatially
    characterize a camera by determining the parameters involved in a response model.
    The uniformity of the source was optimized using the actual camera to be characterized,
    and two different procedures were used to estimate the non-uniformity of the source.
    These procedures are based on varying the distance from the source to the camera
    and, in consequence, the field-of-view area, allowing the non-uniformity of the
    source to be identified as the non-correlated spatial variations in the images.</p>
