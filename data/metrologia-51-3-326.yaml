abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper focuses on the mathematical modelling required to
    support the development of new primary standard systems for traceable calibration
    of dynamic pressure sensors. We address two fundamentally different approaches
    to realizing primary standards, specifically the shock tube method and the drop-weight
    method. Focusing on the shock tube method, the paper presents first results of
    system identification and discusses future experimental work that is required
    to improve the mathematical and statistical models.</p><p> We use simulations
    to identify differences between the shock tube and drop-weight methods, to investigate
    sources of uncertainty in the system identification process and to assist experimentalists
    in designing the required measuring systems. We demonstrate the identification
    method on experimental results and draw conclusions.</p>
