abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)
    gives guidance about how values and uncertainties should be assigned to the input
    quantities that appear in measurement models. This contribution offers a concrete
    proposal for how that guidance may be updated in light of the advances in the
    evaluation and expression of measurement uncertainty that were made in the course
    of the twenty years that have elapsed since the publication of the GUM, and also
    considering situations that the GUM does not yet contemplate. Our motivation is
    the ongoing conversation about a new edition of the GUM.</p><p>While generally
    we favour a Bayesian approach to uncertainty evaluation, we also recognize the
    value that other approaches may bring to the problems considered here, and focus
    on methods for uncertainty evaluation and propagation that are widely applicable,
    including to cases that the GUM has not yet addressed. In addition to Bayesian
    methods, we discuss maximum-likelihood estimation, robust statistical methods,
    and measurement models where values of nominal properties play the same role that
    input quantities play in traditional models. We illustrate these general-purpose
    techniques in concrete examples, employing data sets that are realistic but that
    also are of conveniently small sizes. The supplementary material available online
    lists the R computer code that we have used to produce these examples (stacks.iop.org/Met/51/3/339/mmedia).</p><p>Although
    we strive to stay close to clause 4 of the GUM, which addresses the evaluation
    of uncertainty for input quantities, we depart from it as we review the classes
    of measurement models that we believe are generally useful in contemporary measurement
    science. We also considerably expand and update the treatment that the GUM gives
    to Type B evaluations of uncertainty: reviewing the state-of-the-art, disciplined
    approach to the elicitation of expert knowledge, and its encapsulation in probability
    distributions that are usable in uncertainty propagation exercises. In this we
    deviate markedly and emphatically from the GUM Supplement 1, which gives pride
    of place to the Principle of Maximum Entropy as a means to assign probability
    distributions to input quantities.</p>'
