    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We investigated the use of neutron activation to estimate the <sup>30</sup>Si mole fraction of the ultra-pure silicon material highly enriched in <sup>28</sup>Si for the measurement of the Avogadro constant. Specifically, we developed a relative method based on instrumental neutron activation analysis and using a natural-Si sample as a standard. To evaluate the achievable uncertainty, we irradiated a 6Â g sample of a natural-Si material and modelled experimentally the signal that would be produced by a sample of the <sup>28</sup>Si-enriched material of similar mass and subjected to the same measurement conditions. The extrapolation of the expected uncertainty from the experimental data indicates that a measurement of the <sup>30</sup>Si mole fraction of the <sup>28</sup>Si-enriched material might reach a 4% relative combined standard uncertainty.</p>
