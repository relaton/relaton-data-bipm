abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We investigated the use of neutron activation to estimate the<sup>30</sup>Si
    mole fraction of the ultra-pure silicon material highly enriched in<sup>28</sup>Si
    for the measurement of the Avogadro constant. Specifically, we developed a relative
    method based on instrumental neutron activation analysis and using a natural-Si
    sample as a standard. To evaluate the achievable uncertainty, we irradiated a
    6Â g sample of a natural-Si material and modelled experimentally the signal that
    would be produced by a sample of the<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched material of similar
    mass and subjected to the same measurement conditions. The extrapolation of the
    expected uncertainty from the experimental data indicates that a measurement of
    the<sup>30</sup>Si mole fraction of the<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched material might
    reach a 4% relative combined standard uncertainty.</p>
