abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A primary reference solar cell calibration technique recently
    established at the Korea Institute of Energy Research in Korea is introduced.
    This calibration technique is an indoor method that uses a highly collimated continuous-type
    solar simulator and absolute cavity radiometer traceable to the World Radiometric
    Reference. The results obtained using this calibration technique are shown with
    a precise uncertainty analysis, and the system configuration and calibration procedures
    are introduced. The calibration technique avoids overestimating the short-circuit
    current of a reference solar cell due to multiple reflections of incident simulator
    light using a novel method. In addition, the uncertainty analysis indicates that
    the calibration technique has an expanded uncertainty of approximately 0.7% with
    a coverage factor of k = 2 for a c-Si reference cell calibration. In addition,
    the developed primary reference solar cell calibration technique was compared
    with other techniques established in the World Photovoltaic Scale (WPVS) qualified
    calibration laboratories to verify its validity and reliability.</p>
