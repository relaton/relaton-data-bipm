abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on a direct measurement of the relativistic Doppler
    shift with a commercial free-fall absolute gravimeter of the type FG5X. The observed
    Doppler shift, which is commonly called speed-of-light perturbation, can be well
    described by the relativistic Doppler formula, where the constant object velocity
    is replaced by a time-dependent velocity with constant acceleration. The observed
    speed-of-light perturbation stands in contrast to other publications, which predict
    a higher frequency shift. It has been measured with a relative uncertainty of
    1.1 × 10<sup>−3</sup>.</p>
