    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In 2011, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) confirmed its intention to adopt new definitions for four of the base units of the SI based on fixed numerical values of selected constants. These will be the kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole. The CGPM was not able to adopt the new definitions at that time because certain experimental and coordination work was not complete. This paper reviews criteria proposed by the Consultative Committees of the CIPM for such a ‘new SI’ to be adopted and reports on recent progress with work to address them. We also report on work being undertaken to demonstrate that the most important technical aspects of realizing such a new system are practicable. The progress reported here confirms the consensus developing amongst the Consultative Committees and the National Metrology Institutes that it will be possible for the CGPM to adopt these new definitions in 2018.</p>
