abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)
    has proven to be a major step towards the harmonization of uncertainty evaluation
    in metrology. Its procedures contain elements from both classical and Bayesian
    statistics. The recent supplements 1 and 2 to the GUM appear to move the guidelines
    towards the Bayesian point of view, and they produce a probability distribution
    that shall encode one's state of knowledge about the measurand. In contrast to
    a Bayesian uncertainty analysis, however, Bayes' theorem is not applied explicitly.
    Instead, a distribution is assigned for the input quantities which is then ‘propagated’
    through a model that relates the input quantities to the measurand. The resulting
    distribution for the measurand may coincide with a distribution obtained by the
    application of Bayes' theorem, but this is not true in general.</p><p>The relation
    between a Bayesian uncertainty analysis and the application of the GUM and its
    supplements is investigated. In terms of a simple example, similarities and differences
    in the approaches are illustrated. Then a general class of models is considered
    and conditions are specified for which the distribution obtained by supplement
    1 to the GUM is equivalent to a posterior distribution resulting from the application
    of Bayes' theorem. The corresponding prior distribution is identified and assessed.
    Finally, we briefly compare the GUM approach with a Bayesian uncertainty analysis
    in the context of regression problems.</p>
