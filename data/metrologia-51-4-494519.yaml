abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The ‘ Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    ’ has now served for more than twenty years. In this communication, after attempting
    a balance over this period, the logical reasons are given that, on the one hand,
    led to the decision to update such a successful document, and, on the other hand,
    dictated the modifications that are being carried out with respect to the current
    2008 edition.</p><p>The author is convener of the Joint Committee for Guides in
    Metrology (JCGM) Working Group 1 (Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement,
    or GUM). The opinion expressed in this paper does not necessarily represent the
    view of this Working Group.</p>
