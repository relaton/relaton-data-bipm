abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>When the mass laboratory of DFM was created in 1989, harmonized
    principles for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty were being created based
    on a very simple principle endorsed by the CIPM: all uncertainties should be interpreted
    as the square root of variances (standard deviations) and should be combined and
    expressed as such. This paper describes how DFM has interpreted this principle
    for the calibration of mass standards and for the measurement of mass in general.
    The importance of reporting calibration results in a compact way that is easily
    propagated down the traceability chain is also discussed.</p>'
