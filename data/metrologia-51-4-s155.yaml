    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The ‘<italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>’ has now served for more than twenty years. In this communication, after attempting a balance over this period, the logical reasons are given that, on the one hand, led to the decision to update such a successful document, and, on the other hand, dictated the modifications that are being carried out with respect to the current 2008 edition.</p>
    <p>The author is convener of the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM) Working Group 1 (Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement, or GUM). The opinion expressed in this paper does not necessarily represent the view of this Working Group.</p>
