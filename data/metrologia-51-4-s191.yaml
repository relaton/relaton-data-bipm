    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper provides a selected review of topics relating to evaluating and expressing uncertainty for some measurands that occur in high-frequency electromagnetic metrology. Specific emphasis is given to complex-valued quantities (i.e. vector measurands having both an associated magnitude and phase component), such as scattering parameters (i.e. <italic>S</italic>-parameters) used at radio, microwave, millimetre-wave and terahertz frequencies.</p>
