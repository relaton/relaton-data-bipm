abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper provides a selected review of topics relating to
    evaluating and expressing uncertainty for some measurands that occur in high-frequency
    electromagnetic metrology. Specific emphasis is given to complex-valued quantities
    (i.e. vector measurands having both an associated magnitude and phase component),
    such as scattering parameters (i.e. S-parameters) used at radio, microwave, millimetre-wave
    and terahertz frequencies.</p>
