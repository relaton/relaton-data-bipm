    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The developments that led to the third edition of the <italic>Eurachem Guide ‘Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement’</italic> are reviewed. Particular attention is given to the rationale for early use of spreadsheet methods, the incorporation of method performance data in the second edition, and the third edition's provisions on uncertainties near zero and Monte Carlo methods. The development of uncertainty concepts in chemistry is reviewed briefly and some of the challenges found in early implementation of measurement uncertainty in chemistry are recalled. Problems arising from uncertainty evaluation for reference measurements with limited data are discussed.</p>
