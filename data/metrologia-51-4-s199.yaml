abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The developments that led to the third edition of the Eurachem
    Guide ‘Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement’ are reviewed. Particular
    attention is given to the rationale for early use of spreadsheet methods, the
    incorporation of method performance data in the second edition, and the third
    edition's provisions on uncertainties near zero and Monte Carlo methods. The development
    of uncertainty concepts in chemistry is reviewed briefly and some of the challenges
    found in early implementation of measurement uncertainty in chemistry are recalled.
    Problems arising from uncertainty evaluation for reference measurements with limited
    data are discussed.</p>
