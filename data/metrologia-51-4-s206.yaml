abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measurements often provide an objective basis for making decisions,
    perhaps when assessing whether a product conforms to requirements or whether one
    set of measurements differs significantly from another. There is increasing appreciation
    of the need to account for the role of measurement uncertainty when making decisions,
    so that a ‘fit-for-purpose’ level of measurement effort can be set prior to performing
    a given task. Better mutual understanding between the metrologist and those ordering
    such tasks about the significance and limitations of the measurements when making
    decisions of conformance will be especially useful. Decisions of conformity are,
    however, currently made in many important application areas, such as when addressing
    the grand challenges (energy, health, etc), without a clear and harmonized basis
    for sharing the risks that arise from measurement uncertainty between the consumer,
    supplier and third parties.</p><p>In reviewing, in this paper, the state of the
    art of the use of uncertainty evaluation in conformity assessment and decision-making,
    two aspects in particular—the handling of qualitative observations and of impact—are
    considered key to bringing more order to the present diverse rules of thumb of
    more or less arbitrary limits on measurement uncertainty and percentage risk in
    the field. (i) Decisions of conformity can be made on a more or less quantitative
    basis—referred in statistical acceptance sampling as by ‘variable’ or by ‘attribute’
    (i.e. go/no-go decisions)—depending on the resources available or indeed whether
    a full quantitative judgment is needed or not. There is, therefore, an intimate
    relation between decision-making, relating objects to each other in terms of comparative
    or merely qualitative concepts, and nominal and ordinal properties. (ii) Adding
    measures of impact, such as the costs of incorrect decisions, can give more objective
    and more readily appreciated bases for decisions for all parties concerned. Such
    costs are associated with a variety of consequences, such as unnecessary re-manufacturing
    by the supplier as well as various consequences for the customer, arising from
    incorrect measures of quantity, poor product performance and so on.</p>
