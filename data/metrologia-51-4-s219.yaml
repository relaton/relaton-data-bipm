abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measurements underpin the engineering decisions that allow products
    to be designed, manufactured, operated, and maintained. Therefore, the quality
    of measured data needs to be systematically assured to allow decision makers to
    proceed with confidence. The use of standards is one way of achieving this. This
    paper explores the relevance of international documentary standards to the assessment
    of measurement system capability in High Value Manufacturing (HVM) Industry. An
    internal measurement standard is presented which supplements these standards and
    recommendations are made for a cohesive effort to develop the international standards
    to provide consistency in such industrial applications.</p>
