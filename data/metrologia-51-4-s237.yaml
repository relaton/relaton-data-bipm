abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The expression of uncertainty has hitherto been seen as an add-onâ€”first
    an estimate is obtained and then uncertainty in that estimate is evaluated. We
    argue that quantification of uncertainty should be an intrinsic part of measurement
    and that the measurement result should be a probability distribution for the measurand.</p><p>Full
    quantification of uncertainties in measurement, recognizing and quantifying all
    sources of uncertainty, is rarely simple. Many potential sources of uncertainty
    can effectively only be quantified by the application of expert judgement. Scepticism
    about the validity or reliability of expert judgement has meant that these sources
    of uncertainty have often been overlooked, ignored or treated in a qualitative,
    narrative way. But the consequence of this is that reported expressions of uncertainty
    regularly understate the true degree of uncertainty in measurements.</p><p>This
    article first discusses the concept of quantifying uncertainty in measurement,
    and then considers some of the areas where expert judgement is needed in order
    to quantify fully the uncertainties in measurement. The remainder of the article
    is devoted to describing methodology for eliciting expert knowledge.</p>
