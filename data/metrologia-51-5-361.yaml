abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The results of an absolute silicon molar mass determination
    of two independent sets of samples from the highly<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal
    (AVO28) produced by the International Avogadro Coordination are presented and
    compared with results published by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB,
    Germany), the National Research Council (NRC, Canada) and the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan (NMIJ, Japan). This study developed and describes significant
    changes to the published protocols for producing absolute silicon isotope ratios.
    The measurements were made at very high resolution on a multi-collector inductively
    coupled plasma mass spectrometer using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to
    dissolve and dilute all samples. The various changes in the measurement protocol
    and the use of TMAH resulted in significant improvements to the silicon isotope
    ratio precision over previously reported measurements and in particular, the robustness
    of the<sup>29</sup>Si/<sup>30</sup>Si ratio of the AVO28 material. These new results
    suggest that a limited isotopic variability is present in the AVO28 material.
    The presence of this variability is at present singular and therefore its significance
    is not well understood. Fortunately, its magnitude is small enough so as to have
    an insignificant effect on the overall uncertainty of an Avogadro constant derived
    from the average molar mass of all four AVO28 silicon samples measured in this
    study. The NIST results confirm the AVO28 molar mass values reported by PTB and
    NMIJ and confirm that the virtual element–isotope dilution mass spectrometry approach
    to calibrated absolute isotope ratio measurements developed by PTB is capable
    of very high precision as well as accuracy. The Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub>
    and derived Planck constant h based on these measurements, together with their
    associated standard uncertainties, are 6.02214076(19) × 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup>
    and 6.62607017(21) × 10<sup>−34</sup> Js, respectively.</p>
