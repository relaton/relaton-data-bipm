abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the study of the practical means of a dissemination of the
    redefined kilogram, measurements on 1Â kg mass artefacts were carried out, combining
    high precision mass determination and element-specific surface chemical analysis
    by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In a sequence various processes were
    applied to steel, rhodium and gold artefacts. We studied the transfer from mass
    in air to mass in vacuum, several steps of hydrogen low-pressure plasma cleaning,
    cyclic exposure to air and vacuum and the natural contamination in air with time.
    Values for the gain and loss of mass due to the processes applied are provided.
    Reversible and irreversible sorption effects could be separated by means of mass
    determination, XPS and quartz crystal micro-balance. Possible pathways for the
    traceability of mass in vacuum to mass in air are discussed.</p>
