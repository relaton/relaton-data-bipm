abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>UV/ozone cleaning of 1 kg Au and steel mass artefacts was studied
    by direct mass comparison and surface chemical analysis by XPS. Both materials
    are oxidized with an increasing oxide layer thickness upon prolonged exposure
    time. The gain in mass is significant. The gold oxides are not stable and decompose
    with time in part at ambient. As shown for artefacts of stacked discs, cavities
    and interspaces were also cleaned, but with a much longer cleaning time. Stacked
    discs, having a completely different cleaning time, are questionable for the determination
    of sorption phenomena.</p>
