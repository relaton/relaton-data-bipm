    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Watt balances are used to measure the Planck constant and will be used in the future to realize mass at the kilogram level. They increasingly rely on permanent magnet systems to generate the magnetic flux. It has been known that the weighing current might affect the magnetization state of the permanent-magnet system used in these systems, causing a systematic bias that can lead to an error in the result if not accounted for. In this article, a simple model explaining the effect of the weighing current on the yoke of the magnet is developed. This model leads to a nonlinear dependence of the magnetic flux density in the gap that is proportional to the squared value of the coil current. The effect arises from changing the reluctance of the yoke by the additional field produced by the coil. Our analysis shows that the effect depends on the width of the air gap, the magnetic flux density in the air gap, and the <italic>BH</italic> curve of the yoke material. Suggestions to reduce the nonlinear effect are discussed.</p>
