abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Watt balances are used to measure the Planck constant and will
    be used in the future to realize mass at the kilogram level. They increasingly
    rely on permanent magnet systems to generate the magnetic flux. It has been known
    that the weighing current might affect the magnetization state of the permanent-magnet
    system used in these systems, causing a systematic bias that can lead to an error
    in the result if not accounted for. In this article, a simple model explaining
    the effect of the weighing current on the yoke of the magnet is developed. This
    model leads to a nonlinear dependence of the magnetic flux density in the gap
    that is proportional to the squared value of the coil current. The effect arises
    from changing the reluctance of the yoke by the additional field produced by the
    coil. Our analysis shows that the effect depends on the width of the air gap,
    the magnetic flux density in the air gap, and the BH curve of the yoke material.
    Suggestions to reduce the nonlinear effect are discussed.</p>
