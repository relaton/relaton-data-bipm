abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The effective emissivity of a blackbody with cylindrical geometry
    has a definite radial dependence, at the bottom cavity, which is a function of
    the surface intrinsic emissivity, cavity geometry (L/D) and the temperature gradient
    along the cylinder walls.</p><p>The optimal use of large aperture blackbody cavities,
    particularly in thermal imager calibration applications or for the characterization
    of size-of-source effect of radiation thermometers for example, requires quite
    precise control of the thermal gradient, in order to achieve sources as uniform
    as possible in effective emissivity, over the complete aperture. In this paper,
    we present a numerical model in which the radial profile of effective emissivity
    is optimized, by means of the theoretical modification of the temperature gradients
    in a cylindrical diffuse cavity. The distribution functions of secondary absorption
    impacts are defined and the criteria for a suitable choice of experimentally realizable
    temperature gradients are presented, including the uncertainty analysis.</p>
