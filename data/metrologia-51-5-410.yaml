  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>A measurement model based on the use of a
    pin-cell glow discharge source coupled to a VG 9000 sector field mass spectrometer
    (GD-MS) for the assignment of purity of high-purity metals, i.e., mass fraction
    of metal matrix, <italic>w</italic>(M), is presented. A mass balance approach
    to the calculation requires the determination and summation of impurity mass fractions
    of all extraneous elements present, including non-metals and gases. It is posited
    that a primary method of measurement can be devised to yield <italic>direct</italic>
    traceability of results to the SI. The major source of uncertainty in the traceability
    chain stems from the need to adjust the initially estimated quantity values of
    each impurity element by a relative sensitivity factor ‘influence quantity’ \n<inline-formula>\n<tex-math><?CDATA
    $({\\rm RSF}_{{\\rm M}}^{{\\rm e}} )$ ></tex-math>\n<inline-graphic xlink:href=\"metro495563ieqn001.gif\"
    xlink:type=\"simple\"></inline-graphic>\n</inline-formula>, derived from <italic>ab
    initio</italic> calculations, and validated through comparison with those derived
    through use of Certified Reference Materials. It is argued that the method is
    sufficiently well understood that a measurement equation can be formulated for
    which all parameters are measured in terms of SI units; that all contributions
    to uncertainty of measurement can be quantitatively evaluated, underpinning the
    metrological traceability; and that the performance of GD-MS in CCQM key and pilot
    comparisons of trace elements in complex metal matrices is in conformance with
    claimed capabilities. The applicability of the approach to metals in the 3N to
    7N range of purity shows that fit-for-purpose relative expanded uncertainties
    of 0.5% to 0.000 05% can be conservatively achieved for <italic>w</italic>(M).
    Presentation of various instrument calibration scenarios vis-à-vis impact on SI
    traceability of results is also undertaken with a view to eliciting further discussion
    of this concept within the metrological community.</p>\n"
