abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A measurement model based on the use of a pin-cell glow discharge
    source coupled to a VG 9000 sector field mass spectrometer (GD-MS) for the assignment
    of purity of high-purity metals, i.e., mass fraction of metal matrix, w(M), is
    presented. A mass balance approach to the calculation requires the determination
    and summation of impurity mass fractions of all extraneous elements present, including
    non-metals and gases. It is posited that a primary method of measurement can be
    devised to yield direct traceability of results to the SI. The major source of
    uncertainty in the traceability chain stems from the need to adjust the initially
    estimated quantity values of each impurity element by a relative sensitivity factor
    ‘influence quantity’, derived from ab initio calculations, and validated through
    comparison with those derived through use of Certified Reference Materials. It
    is argued that the method is sufficiently well understood that a measurement equation
    can be formulated for which all parameters are measured in terms of SI units;
    that all contributions to uncertainty of measurement can be quantitatively evaluated,
    underpinning the metrological traceability; and that the performance of GD-MS
    in CCQM key and pilot comparisons of trace elements in complex metal matrices
    is in conformance with claimed capabilities. The applicability of the approach
    to metals in the 3N to 7N range of purity shows that fit-for-purpose relative
    expanded uncertainties of 0.5% to 0.000 05% can be conservatively achieved for
    w(M). Presentation of various instrument calibration scenarios vis-à-vis impact
    on SI traceability of results is also undertaken with a view to eliciting further
    discussion of this concept within the metrological community.</p>
