abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Pressure reciprocity calibration of microphones provides the
    basis for primary measurement standards for sound pressure in air. At low frequencies,
    reciprocity calibration requires that a heat conduction correction be employed
    to account for energy transfer to and from the bounding surfaces of the close-coupled
    microphone arrangement. The standard governing reciprocity calibration, IEC 61094-2 : 2009,
    provides two models for the heat conduction correction: the Low Frequency Solution,
    and the Broadband Solution. Analysis has revealed significant and unexplained
    differences in behaviour between the models at very low frequencies, leading to
    inconsistency in calibration results, which has been quantified. Additionally,
    both heat conduction solutions given in IEC 61094-2 are simplifications that strictly
    apply only above their respective lower limiting frequencies. An international
    comparison on microphone calibration is currently underway that includes measurements
    below the lower limiting frequencies of the models. In this paper, the origin
    and nature of the Broadband simplifications have been identified, and estimates
    of the error given. A flaw in the Broadband theory is identified and its effect
    quantified. Simplification error for the Low Frequency solution is evaluated,
    and the full spectrum solution is given. This paper urges caution in the application
    of the models at low frequency and provides data useful for assessing the contribution
    to the measurement uncertainty.</p>'
