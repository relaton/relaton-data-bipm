abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A regular assessment is fundamental to ensure that a balance
    provides reliable and accurate weighing results. Calibration is the main means
    to establish the relation between the balance indications and the reference standards,
    which will be applied in the use of the balance in order to obtain a traceable
    result. The main problem in the calibration of high-resolution balances is related
    to the corrections of the buoyancy effects. In addition, electronic balances can
    be compensated, for their drift due to changes in temperature, air density and
    other influence factors, by the adjustment function. This paper analyses in detail
    the influence of these effects on the weighing and proposes an original model
    to be used in the calibration and in the subsequent use of the balance. The uncertainty
    evaluation has been studied with the aim to separate the uncertainty due to the
    calibration process from that of the balance in use, taking also into account
    the correlations between the input estimates. This analysis has revealed important
    aspects on the uncertainty of the weighing result to be considered in high-resolution
    balances.</p>
