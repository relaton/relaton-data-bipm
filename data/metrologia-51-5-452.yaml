abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Typical atomic gravimeters have a heavy magnetic shielding to
    avoid the quadratic Zeeman effect, and also a complicated active vibration isolation
    system to suppress the vibration noise. Both of them make it difficult to build
    a mobile and compact gravimeter. In this paper, we present the implementation
    of an atomic gravimeter aiming at field applications. Our gravimeter uses improved
    magnetic coils instead of the expensive mu-metal for magnetic shielding. The quadratic
    Zeeman shift is evaluated with high accuracy. Moreover, a portable platform of
    relatively small size is applied for vibration isolation. The total interrogation
    time is optimized to 120 ms and the repetition rate is 2.2 Hz. A sensitivity of
    1.0 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g Hz<sup>−1/2</sup> and a resolution of 5.7 × 10<sup>−9</sup> g
    within 1000 s integration time are reached. A continuous g measurement over 128 h
    is carried out. Moreover, a whole seismic wave of about 1 h that occurred in Pakistan
    on 28 September 2013 is recorded by our atomic gravimeter. The results coincide
    with that recorded by a traditional seismic detector very well.</p>
