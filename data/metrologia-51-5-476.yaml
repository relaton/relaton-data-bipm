abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We present a direct comparison between two different techniques
    for the relative calibration of time transfer between remote time scales when
    using the signals transmitted by the Global Positioning System (GPS). Relative
    calibration estimates the delay of equipment or the delay of a time transfer link
    with respect to reference equipment. It is based on the circulation of some travelling
    GPS equipment between the stations in the network, against which the local equipment
    is measured. Two techniques can be considered: first a station calibration by
    the computation of the hardware delays of the local GPS equipment; second the
    computation of a global hardware delay offset for the time transfer between the
    reference points of two remote time scales. This last technique is called a ‘link’
    calibration, with respect to the other one, which is a ‘receiver’ calibration.
    The two techniques require different measurements on site, which change the uncertainty
    budgets, and we discuss this and related issues. We report on one calibration
    campaign organized during Autumn 2013 between Observatoire de Paris (OP), Paris,
    France, Observatoire de la Côte d''Azur (OCA), Calern, France, and NERC Space
    Geodesy Facility (SGF), Herstmonceux, United Kingdom. The travelling equipment
    comprised two GPS receivers of different types, along with the required signal
    generator and distribution amplifier, and one time interval counter. We show the
    different ways to compute uncertainty budgets, leading to improvement factors
    of 1.2 to 1.5 on the hardware delay uncertainties when comparing the relative
    link calibration to the relative receiver calibration.</p>'
