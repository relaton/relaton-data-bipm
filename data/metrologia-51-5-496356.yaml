abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The variation in the response of instruments with neutron energy
    has to be determined in well-characterized monoenergetic neutron fields. The quantities
    associated with these fields are the neutron fluence and the mean energy of the
    monoenergetic neutron peak needed to determine the related dosimetric quantities.
    At the IRSN AMANDE facility, the reference measurement standard for neutron fluence
    is based on a long counter calibrated in the IRSN reference<sup>252</sup>Cf neutron
    field. In this paper, the final characterization of this device is presented as
    well as the method used to determine the reference fluence at the calibration
    point in monoenergetic neutron fields.</p>
