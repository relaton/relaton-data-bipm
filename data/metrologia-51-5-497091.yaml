abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In December 2003, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB) started the development of an optical-based primary flow rate standard for
    application in natural gas under high pressures (up to 5.5Â MPa). The concept underlying
    this technology will be presented in this paper. The technical approach is based
    on the application of a conventional laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) as well as
    on a new LDV-based boundary layer sensor. Both technologies are used to determine
    the characteristic values of the core flow and the boundary layer in a nozzle
    flow in a separated approach. Because of the high relevance to the demonstration
    of traceability and to the evaluation of the uncertainty, the related data processing
    (especially for the boundary layer) is explained in detail. Finally, after summarizing
    the uncertainty budget for the optical-based primary standard, we will demonstrate
    the approval of the new primary standard by means of a comparison with the established
    conventional traceability of PTB for high-pressure natural gas.</p>
