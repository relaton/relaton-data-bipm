abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This work demonstrates accurate measurement of the amount of
    substance concentration of low concentration plasmid DNA by counting individual
    DNA molecules using a high-sensitivity flow cytometric setup. Plasmid DNA is a
    widely used form of DNA, and its quantity often needs to be accurately determined.
    This work establishes a reference analytical method for direct quantification
    of low concentration plasmid DNA prepared as reference standards for polymerase
    chain reaction-based DNA quantification. The model plasmid DNA pBR322 (4361 bp)
    was stained with a fluorescent dye and was detected in a flow stream in a micro-fluidic
    channel with laser-induced fluorescence detection, for which the DNA flow was
    electro-hydrodynamically focused at the centre of the channel. 200 to 8000 DNA
    molecules in a ∼1 µL sample volume were counted within 2 min in an ‘exhaustive
    counting’ manner, which facilitated quantitation without calibration. The sample
    volume was measured and validated from the close agreement of the results of two
    independent measurement methods, gravimetric determination of water filling the
    capillary and graphical estimation of actual cross sectional area of the capillary
    tubing with the image of calibrated scanning electron microscopy. Within the given
    concentration range, an excellent measurement linearity ( R<sup>2</sup> = 0.999)
    was achieved with appropriate data processing for the correction of the events
    of double molecules (detection of double molecules opposed to single molecule
    detection assumed, which occurs due to their coincidental passing of the detection
    zone). The validity of the proposed method was confirmed from the close agreement
    with the results of quantitation of enzymatically released nucleotides using capillary
    electrophoresis.</p>
