abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The radiant intensity of synchrotron radiation can be accurately
    calculated within classical electrodynamics. Based on this primary realization
    of the spectral radiant intensity, a dedicated facility for the calibration of
    radiation sources has recently been put into operation at the Metrology Light
    Source (MLS), the electron storage ring of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    which is optimized for use as a primary radiation source standard. This facility
    enables PTB to calibrate a radiation source either in terms of spectral radiant
    intensity or spectral radiance in the spectral region from 7 nm to 400 nm by direct
    comparison with the primary source standard MLS. In this paper, we focus on the
    internal validation of the facility in the spectral range from 116 nm to 400 nm
    by means of deuterium lamps and a tungsten ribbon lamp as transfer standards,
    which have been traceably calibrated at the BESSY II electron storage ring and
    also—in the case of the tungsten ribbon lamp—to a blackbody radiator as primary
    standards.</p>
