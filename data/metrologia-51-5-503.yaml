abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The T2L2 project (time transfer by laser link) allows for the
    synchronization of remote ultra-stable clocks over intercontinental distances
    (Fridelance et al 1997 Exp. Astron. 7, Samain and Fridelance 1998 Metrologia 35
    151–9). The principle is derived from satellite laser ranging technology with
    dedicated space equipment designed to record arrival times of laser pulses at
    the satellite. The space segment has been launched in June 2008 as a passenger
    experiment on the ocean altimetry satellite Jason 2. T2L2 had been specified to
    yield a time stability of better than 1 ps over 1000 s integration time and an
    accuracy of better than 100 ps. This level of performance requires a rigorous
    data processing which can be performed only with a comprehensive calibration model
    of the whole instrumentation. For this purpose, several experimental measurements
    have been performed before and during the integration phase of the T2L2 space
    instrument. This instrument model is one of the cornerstones of the data reduction
    process which is carried out to translate the raw information to a usable picosecond
    time transfer. After providing a global synopsis of the T2L2 space instrument,
    the paper gives a description of the experimental setup for the instrument characterization.
    It then details the different contributions within the calibration model and concludes
    with an applied example of a space to ground time transfer.</p>
