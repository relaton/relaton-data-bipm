abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Birge ratio is applied in metrology to enlarge quoted uncertainties
    when combining inconsistent measurement results on the same measurand. We discuss
    the statistical model underlying such a procedure and argue that the resulting
    uncertainty associated with the adjusted value is underrated. We provide a simple
    modification of this uncertainty on the basis of an objective Bayesian inference.
    While the proposed uncertainty approaches that obtained by the conventional procedure
    for a large number n of combined measurement results, differences are significant
    for small n. For example, for n = 4 we get an increase of 73% in the standard
    uncertainty associated with the adjusted value, and for n = 10 the increase is
    still 13%. We derive the posterior distribution for the adjusted value in closed
    form, including a 95% credible interval. In addition, we show that our results
    do not only hold when the distribution of the measurement results is assumed to
    be Gaussian, but for a whole family of (elliptically contoured) location-scale
    distributions. We illustrate the modified Birge method by its application to data
    from the 2002 adjustment of the Newtonian constant of gravitation.</p>
