abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Sniffer tests are used to locate leaks in equipment during operation.
    The sensitivity of a sniffer leak detector must be calibrated against a known
    gas flow to atmospheric pressure generated by a sniffer test leak artefact. We
    have developed a primary flow meter for calibrating gas flows to atmospheric pressure
    through the leak artefact. The flow meter is based on a pressure rise method and
    two chambers are used to measure the pressure rise with small uncertainty even
    at atmospheric pressure. The calibration range of the flow rate is 5 × 10<sup>−7</sup> Pa m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>
    to 7 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> to atmospheric pressure
    at 23.0 °C with a minimum uncertainty of 1.4% (k = 2), as well as 4 × 10<sup>−8</sup> Pa m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>
    to 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> to a vacuum at 23.0 °C.
    The long term stability of the flow meter was determined as 0.41% by repeated
    measurements of the conductance of the leak artefact. In case of the flow rate
    into a vacuum, the flow meter was successfully linked to the international reference
    value of CCM.P-K12 by a lab-internal comparison.</p>
