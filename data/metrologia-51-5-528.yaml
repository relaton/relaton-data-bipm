    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The radiant intensity of synchrotron radiation can be accurately calculated within classical electrodynamics. Based on this primary realization of the spectral radiant intensity, a dedicated facility for the calibration of radiation sources has recently been put into operation at the Metrology Light Source (MLS), the electron storage ring of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt which is optimized for use as a primary radiation source standard. This facility enables PTB to calibrate a radiation source either in terms of spectral radiant intensity or spectral radiance in the spectral region from 7 nm to 400 nm by direct comparison with the primary source standard MLS. In this paper, we focus on the internal validation of the facility in the spectral range from 116 nm to 400 nm by means of deuterium lamps and a tungsten ribbon lamp as transfer standards, which have been traceably calibrated at the BESSY II electron storage ring and also—in the case of the tungsten ribbon lamp—to a blackbody radiator as primary standards.</p>
