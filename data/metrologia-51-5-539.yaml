abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>LNG custody transfer measurements at large terminals have been
    based on ship tank level gauging for more than 50 years. Flow meter application
    has mainly been limited to process control in spite of the promise of simplified
    operations, potentially smaller uncertainties and better control over the measurements
    for buyers. The reason for this has been the lack of LNG flow calibration standards
    as well as written standards. In the framework of the EMRP ‘Metrology for LNG’
    project, Van Swinden Laboratory (VSL) has developed a primary LNG mass flow standard.
    This standard is so far the only one in the world except for a liquid nitrogen
    flow standard at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The
    VSL standard is based on weighing and holds a Calibration and Measurement Capability
    (CMC) of 0.12% to 0.15%. This paper discusses the measurement principle, results
    of the uncertainty validation with LNG and the differences between water and LNG
    calibration results of four Coriolis mass flow meters. Most of the calibrated
    meters do not comply with their respective accuracy claims. Recommendations for
    further improvement of the measurement uncertainty will also be discussed.</p>
