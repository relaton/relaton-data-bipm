abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The paper by Rothleitner et al (2014 Metrologia 51 L9) reports
    on the measurement of the speed-of-light perturbation in absolute gravimeters.
    The conclusion that the perturbation reaches only \n\n\n\n of the commonly accepted
    value violates the fundamental limitation on the maximum speed of information
    transfer. The conclusion was deluded by unaccounted parasitic perturbations, some
    of which are obvious from the report.</p>"
