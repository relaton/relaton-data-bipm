abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We report the direct comparison between the stabilities of
    two mobile absolute gravimeters of different technology: the LNE-SYRTE Cold Atom
    Gravimeter (CAG) and FG5X#216 of the Universit√© du Luxembourg. These instruments
    rely on two different principles of operation: atomic and optical interferometry.
    The comparison took place in the Walferdange Underground Laboratory for Geodynamics
    in Luxembourg, at the beginning of the last International Comparison of Absolute
    Gravimeters, ICAG-2013. We analyse a 2h10 duration common measurement, and find
    that the CAG shows better immunity with respect to changes in the level of vibration
    noise, as well as a slightly better short term stability.</p>'
