abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The solar ultraviolet spectrum captured by commercially available
    diode-array spectroradiometers is dominated by stray light from longer wavelengths
    with higher intensity. The implementation of a digital micromirror device in an
    array spectroradiometer has the potential to enable the precise selection of desired
    wavelengths as well as the ability to reduce spectral intensity of some wavelengths
    via selective mirror modulation, both reducing long wavelength stray light. A
    prototype consisting of off-the-shelf components has been assembled to verify
    the validity of the base concept, and initial measurements have been performed
    to confirm the throughput and image qualities such as spectral resolution and
    astigmatism.</p>
