abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The production of incandescent light bulbs is bound to end,
    as incandescent lighting is being phased out globally in favour of more energy-efficient
    and sustainable solutions. Temporally stable light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are
    potential candidates to replace incandescent lamps as photometric source standards.
    However, traditional  V ( λ ) filter based photometers may have large uncertainty
    when LEDs are measured instead of incandescent lamps. This is due to the narrow
    and complicated spectra of LEDs. When the spectra of LEDs are limited to the visible
    wavelength range, new silicon detector technology can be advantageously exploited
    in photometry. We present a novel method—based on the recently introduced Predictable
    Quantum Efficient Detector (PQED)—for the realization of photometric units which
    completely eliminates the need to use  V ( λ ) filters. Instead, the photometric
    weighting is taken into account numerically by measuring the relative spectral
    irradiance. The illuminance values of a blue and a red LED were determined using
    the new method and a conventional reference photometer. The values obtained by
    the two methods deviated from each other by −0.06% and 0.48% for the blue and
    red LED, respectively. The PQED-based values have much lower standard uncertainty
    (0.17% to 0.18%) than the uncertainty of the values based on the conventional
    photometer (0.46% to 0.51%).</p>
