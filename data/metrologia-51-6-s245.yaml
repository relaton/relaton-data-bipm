abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the concept of a dual-mode primary standard cryogenic
    detector, utilizing a predictable quantum efficient silicon photodiode, and demonstrate
    the behaviour of the detector from room temperature down to 30 K. The detector
    absorbs visible radiation generating either heat or photocurrent, dependent on
    the selected mode of operation. In effect, this detector links optical power to
    fundamental constants through the two different routes of operation in the one
    artefact. Forward biasing of the photodiode is used in lieu of resistive heating
    to provide the electrical substitution power. The detector has a thermal time
    constant of 50 s and a sensitivity of 1.39 K mW<sup>−1</sup>. Using an LED source,
    we measure equivalence between the two modes of operation of 1.5% at 50 K, limited
    principally by our knowledge of the wavelength of the emitted radiation of the
    source.</p>
