    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>IR-enhanced Si photodiodes have improved radiometric and electronic characteristics as compared to other widely used Si photodiodes and can be used as responsivity standards in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 1000 nm. Their low predicted uncertainty for radiant power responsivity measurements can result in improvements in the existing monochromator-based Si responsivity scales. They have several advantages over traditionally used Si-trap detectors, such as wider acceptance angle, higher shunt resistance, and higher responsivity in the NIR region. Radiometric and electronic measurement results are discussed to illustrate these characteristics. The spectral power responsivity scales can be improved using a set of the IR-enhanced Si photodiodes not only to transfer the calibration from the cryogenic radiometer, but for use in the monochromator facility as working standards. This improvement will reduce the length of the calibration chain and create a one-step scale transfer between the cryogenic radiometer- and the monochromator-based facility.</p>
