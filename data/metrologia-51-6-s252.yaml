abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>IR-enhanced Si photodiodes have improved radiometric and electronic
    characteristics as compared to other widely used Si photodiodes and can be used
    as responsivity standards in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 1000 nm. Their
    low predicted uncertainty for radiant power responsivity measurements can result
    in improvements in the existing monochromator-based Si responsivity scales. They
    have several advantages over traditionally used Si-trap detectors, such as wider
    acceptance angle, higher shunt resistance, and higher responsivity in the NIR
    region. Radiometric and electronic measurement results are discussed to illustrate
    these characteristics. The spectral power responsivity scales can be improved
    using a set of the IR-enhanced Si photodiodes not only to transfer the calibration
    from the cryogenic radiometer, but for use in the monochromator facility as working
    standards. This improvement will reduce the length of the calibration chain and
    create a one-step scale transfer between the cryogenic radiometer- and the monochromator-based
    facility.</p>
