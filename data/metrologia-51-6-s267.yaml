abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The ‘Metrology for Industrial Quantum Communication Technologies’
    project (MIQC) is a metrology framework that fosters development and market take-up
    of quantum communication technologies and is aimed at achieving maximum impact
    for the European industry in this area.</p><p>MIQC is focused on quantum key distribution
    (QKD) technologies, the most advanced quantum-based technology towards practical
    application. QKD is a way of sending cryptographic keys with absolute security.
    It does this by exploiting the ability to encode in a photon's degree of freedom
    specific quantum states that are noticeably disturbed if an eavesdropper trying
    to decode it is present in the communication channel. The MIQC project has started
    the development of independent measurement standards and definitions for the optical
    components of QKD system, since one of the perceived barriers to QKD market success
    is the lack of standardization and quality assurance.</p>
