abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The production of incandescent light bulbs is bound to end,
    as incandescent lighting is being phased out globally in favour of more energy-efficient
    and sustainable solutions. Temporally stable light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are
    potential candidates to replace incandescent lamps as photometric source standards.
    However, traditional V(λ) filter based photometers may have large uncertainty
    when LEDs are measured instead of incandescent lamps. This is due to the narrow
    and complicated spectra of LEDs. When the spectra of LEDs are limited to the visible
    wavelength range, new silicon detector technology can be advantageously exploited
    in photometry. We present a novel method—based on the recently introduced Predictable
    Quantum Efficient Detector (PQED)—for the realization of photometric units which
    completely eliminates the need to use V(λ) filters. Instead, the photometric weighting
    is taken into account numerically by measuring the relative spectral irradiance.
    The illuminance values of a blue and a red LED were determined using the new method
    and a conventional reference photometer. The values obtained by the two methods
    deviated from each other by −0.06% and 0.48% for the blue and red LED, respectively.
    The PQED-based values have much lower standard uncertainty (0.17% to 0.18%) than
    the uncertainty of the values based on the conventional photometer (0.46% to 0.51%).</p>
