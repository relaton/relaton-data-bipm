abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In a joint project, sglux and PTB investigated and developed
    methods and equipment to measure the spectral and weighted irradiance of high-efficiency
    UV-C emitters used in water disinfection plants.</p><p>A calibration facility
    was set up to calibrate the microbicidal irradiance responsivity of actinic radiometers
    with respect to the weighted spectral irradiance of specially selected low-pressure
    mercury and medium-pressure mercury UV lamps.</p><p>To verify the calibration
    method and to perform on-site tests, spectral measurements were carried out directly
    at water disinfection plants in operation. The weighted microbicidal irradiance
    of the plants was calculated and compared to the measurements of various actinic
    radiometers.</p>
