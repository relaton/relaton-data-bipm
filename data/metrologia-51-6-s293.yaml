abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a novel instrumentation scheme for measuring the
    two-dimensional distribution of spectral reflectance based on the spectral imaging
    technique. It takes digital spectral images of a test sample using a LED-based
    monochromatic integrating sphere source and a monochrome CCD camera. We developed
    a calibration algorithm to assign the digital counts of the images to the reflectance
    values at each wavelength. The measurement uncertainty is evaluated to be less
    than 1.5% (k = 2) for high-reflectance samples (with reflectance ⩾0.4) and less
    than 3% (k = 2) for low-reflectance samples (with reflectance &lt;0.4). For a
    validity test, we demonstrate an agreement with the results of a reference spectrophotometer
    within 1% for high-reflectance samples or within 2% for low-reflectance samples.
    This scheme of ‘imaging spectrophotometer’ is promising to measure the spatially
    resolved spectral reflectance of complex samples only by a single wavelength scan.</p>
