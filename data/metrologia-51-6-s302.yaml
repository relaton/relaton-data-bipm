    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Analysis methods and instrumentation for obtaining optical parameters and thickness profiles of thin-film samples from spectrophotometric and ellipsometric measurements are presented. Measured samples include thermally grown and evaporated SiO<sub>2</sub> on a silicon substrate and a polymer photoresist layer on silicon. Experimental results at multiple sample positions give the thickness uniformity and optical constants of thin films. The thickness results obtained with spectrophotometry and ellipsometry agree within 1 nm for the 300 nm thick layer of SiO<sub>2</sub> on silicon. For the 1600 nm thick resist sample the agreement of the measurement methods is within 8 nm. For the sample with a nominally 6000 nm thick layer of SiO<sub>2</sub> on silicon, there is a deviation of ∼100 nm between the spectrophotometry and ellipsometry results. As an application, the optical parameters of a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer on an induced junction silicon photodiode are determined by spectrophotometry and are used to confirm earlier values and uncertainties of the SiO<sub>2</sub> refractive index and layer thickness non-uniformity.</p>
