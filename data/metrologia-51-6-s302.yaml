abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Analysis methods and instrumentation for obtaining optical parameters
    and thickness profiles of thin-film samples from spectrophotometric and ellipsometric
    measurements are presented. Measured samples include thermally grown and evaporated
    SiO<sub>2</sub> on a silicon substrate and a polymer photoresist layer on silicon.
    Experimental results at multiple sample positions give the thickness uniformity
    and optical constants of thin films. The thickness results obtained with spectrophotometry
    and ellipsometry agree within 1 nm for the 300 nm thick layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>
    on silicon. For the 1600 nm thick resist sample the agreement of the measurement
    methods is within 8 nm. For the sample with a nominally 6000 nm thick layer of
    SiO<sub>2</sub> on silicon, there is a deviation of ∼100 nm between the spectrophotometry
    and ellipsometry results. As an application, the optical parameters of a SiO<sub>2</sub>
    layer on an induced junction silicon photodiode are determined by spectrophotometry
    and are used to confirm earlier values and uncertainties of the SiO<sub>2</sub>
    refractive index and layer thickness non-uniformity.</p>
