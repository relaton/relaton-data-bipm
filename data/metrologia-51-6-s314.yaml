abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Angularly resolved measurements of scattered light from surfaces
    can provide useful information in various fields of research and industry, such
    as computer graphics, satellite based Earth observation etc. In practice, empirical
    or physics-based models are needed to interpolate the measurement results, because
    a thorough characterization of the surfaces under all relevant conditions may
    not be feasible. In this work, plain and anodized metal samples were prepared
    and measured optically for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)
    and mechanically for surface roughness. Two models for BRDF (Torrance–Sparrow
    model and a polarimetric BRDF model) were fitted to the measured values. A better
    fit was obtained for plain metal surfaces than for anodized surfaces.</p>
