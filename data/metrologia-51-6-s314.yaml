    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Angularly resolved measurements of scattered light from surfaces can provide useful information in various fields of research and industry, such as computer graphics, satellite based Earth observation etc. In practice, empirical or physics-based models are needed to interpolate the measurement results, because a thorough characterization of the surfaces under all relevant conditions may not be feasible. In this work, plain and anodized metal samples were prepared and measured optically for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and mechanically for surface roughness. Two models for BRDF (Torrance–Sparrow model and a polarimetric BRDF model) were fitted to the measured values. A better fit was obtained for plain metal surfaces than for anodized surfaces.</p>
