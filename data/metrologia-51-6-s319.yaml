abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Changes in the directional reflectance properties of pressed
    and sintered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) diffusers induced by exposure to vacuum
    ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation before and after controlled contamination with Pennzane
    are presented in this paper. A set of 99% reflective, white, optical grade diffuse
    calibration standards were irradiated with a VUV source positioned at 60° to the
    diffuser normal. The bidirectional reflectance distribution functions before and
    after contamination and VUV irradiation were measured and compared at a number
    of scatter geometries and wavelengths in the UV, VIS and IR spectral ranges. The
    8° directional hemispherical reflectance’s were also measured and compared from
    200 nm to 2500 nm. Our results indicate a measureable impact of VUV irradiation
    on pressed and sintered PTFE diffusers as manifested by a directional dependent
    change in their reflectance. Such an effect needs to be considered in the on-orbit
    deployment of PTFE diffusers.</p>
