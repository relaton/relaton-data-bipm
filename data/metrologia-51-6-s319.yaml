    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Changes in the directional reflectance properties of pressed and sintered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) diffusers induced by exposure to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation before and after controlled contamination with Pennzane are presented in this paper. A set of 99% reflective, white, optical grade diffuse calibration standards were irradiated with a VUV source positioned at 60° to the diffuser normal. The bidirectional reflectance distribution functions before and after contamination and VUV irradiation were measured and compared at a number of scatter geometries and wavelengths in the UV, VIS and IR spectral ranges. The 8° directional hemispherical reflectance’s were also measured and compared from 200 nm to 2500 nm. Our results indicate a measureable impact of VUV irradiation on pressed and sintered PTFE diffusers as manifested by a directional dependent change in their reflectance. Such an effect needs to be considered in the on-orbit deployment of PTFE diffusers.</p>
