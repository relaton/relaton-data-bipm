- content: Abstract<p>Radiometric calibrations of fibre-coupled single photon detectors
    are experiencing growing demand, especially at the telecommunication wavelengths.
    In this paper, the radiometric calibration of a fibre-coupled superconducting
    nano-wire single photon detector at the telecom wavelength 1.55 µm by means of
    well-characterized synchrotron radiation is described. This substitution method
    is based on the unique properties of synchrotron radiation and the Metrology Light
    Source, the dedicated electron storage ring of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt,
    and is suitable for fibre-coupled single photon detectors. The Metrology Light
    Source is used as a light source with a high dynamic range of the radiant power
    to bridge the radiometric gap occurring in the transition from radiant power measurements
    and the counting of photons with single photon detectors. Very low uncertainties
    below 2% have been achieved in the measurement of the detection efficiency of
    a fibre-coupled superconducting nano-wire single photon detector.</p>
