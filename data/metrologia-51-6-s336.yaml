    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The CCPR K2.c key comparison of spectral responsivity from 200 nm to 400 nm was carried out in the framework of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement by 14 participating national metrology institutes. The key comparison was piloted by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The comparison principle, measurements, analysis and results including a procedure to deal with the issue of inconsistent data are described.</p>
