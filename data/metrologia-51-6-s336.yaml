abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The CCPR K2.c key comparison of spectral responsivity from 200 nm
    to 400 nm was carried out in the framework of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    by 14 participating national metrology institutes. The key comparison was piloted
    by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The comparison principle,
    measurements, analysis and results including a procedure to deal with the issue
    of inconsistent data are described.</p>
