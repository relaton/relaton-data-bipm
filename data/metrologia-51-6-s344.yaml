abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A recently built cryogenic solar absolute radiometer aims to
    reduce the uncertainty of terrestrially measured direct solar irradiance from
    0.3% to 0.01%. Because solar irradiance entering a cryogenic radiometer is partly
    reflected and absorbed by the entrance window, the spectrally integrated transmittance
    of the broadband solar irradiance needs to be determined in parallel to correct
    the power reading of the cryogenic radiometer for these losses. To meet the accuracy
    requirements of the radiometer, the Monitor to Measure the Integral Transmittance
    of Windows (MITRA) aims to measure the spectrally integrated transmittance of
    a window identical to that used for the cryogenic radiometer with an uncertainty
    of less than 0.01%. The current model of the MITRA instrument measures transmittances
    with an instrument stability of 0.015% under laboratory conditions, almost achieving
    the instrument requirement. This proves that the accuracy of terrestrial irradiance
    measurements can be significantly increased by means of a cryogenic solar absolute
    radiometer, which can then be utilized as a new calibration standard for terrestrial
    absolute radiometry.</p>
