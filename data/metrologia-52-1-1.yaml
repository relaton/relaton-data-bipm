abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>While a new type of oscillating-cup viscometer which uses a
    rotating magnetic field has been developed and tested, the uncertainty of such
    measurements has been considered to only a cursory level. This paper reports work
    in which the sensitivities of this new methodâ€™s output are studied for the measurement
    of mercury with a particular device. It is concluded from the analysis that while
    the new method requires dramatically shorter measurement times than previous methods,
    the resultant uncertainty seems to be nearly the same as the classical oscillating
    cup method. As such, since the results are just as precise as other oscillating-cup
    methods, the new method should be employed for its speed advantage, allowing the
    viscosity of materials as functions of temperature or pressure to be economically
    determined.</p>
