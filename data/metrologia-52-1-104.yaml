abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The neon triple point is one of the defining fixed points of
    the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). Although recognizing that
    natural neon is a mixture of isotopes, the ITS-90 definition only states that
    the neon should be of ‘natural isotopic composition’, without any further requirements.
    A preliminary study in 2005 indicated that most of the observed variability in
    the realized neon triple point temperatures within a range of about 0.5 mK can
    be attributed to the variability in isotopic composition among different samples
    of ‘natural’ neon. Based on the results of an International Project (EUROMET Project
    No. 770), the Consultative Committee for Thermometry decided to improve the realization
    of the neon fixed point by assigning the ITS-90 temperature value 24.5561 K to
    neon with the isotopic composition recommended by IUPAC, accompanied by a quadratic
    equation to take the deviations from the reference composition into account. In
    this paper, the uncertainties of the equation are discussed and an uncertainty
    budget is presented. The resulting standard uncertainty due to the isotopic effect
    (k = 1) after correction of the calibration data is reduced to (4 to 40) μK when
    using neon of ‘natural’ isotopic composition or to 30 μK when using<sup>20</sup>Ne.
    For comparison, an uncertainty component of 0.15 mK should be included in the
    uncertainty budget for the neon triple point if the isotopic composition is unknown,
    i.e. whenever the correction cannot be applied.</p>
