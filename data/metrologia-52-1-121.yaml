abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Reflection and transmission of microwaves in coaxial devices
    are usually described by S-parameters. The current definition of S-parameters
    requires that the reference plane is in a section of ideal wave guide. Due to
    this, tremendous effort is necessary to facilitate the dissemination of standards,
    for the comparison of measurement values and for cascading devices. These processes
    can be simplified by extending the definition of S-parameters to reference planes
    in sections of non-ideal wave guide, e.g. in connectors. Extended S-parameters
    can be approximated with conventional simulation programs. Practical experiments
    show that extended S-parameters can be compared and cascaded without effort.</p>
