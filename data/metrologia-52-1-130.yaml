abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The inhomogeneities within a thermocouple influence the measured
    temperature and contribute the largest component to uncertainty. Currently there
    is no accepted best practice for measuring the inhomogeneities or for forecasting
    their effects on real-world measurements. The aim of this paper is to provide
    guidance on the design and performance assessment of thermocouple inhomogeneity
    scanners by characterizing the qualitative performance of the various designs
    reported in the literature, and developing a quantitative measure of scanner resolution.
    Numerical simulations incorporating Fourier transforms and convolutions are used
    to gauge the levels of attenuation and distortion present in single- and double-gradient
    scanners. Single-gradient scanners are found to be far superior to double-gradient
    scanners, which are unsuitable for quantitative measurements due to their blindness
    to inhomogeneities at many spatial frequencies and severe attenuation of signals
    at other frequencies. It is recommended that the standard deviation of the temperature
    gradient within the scanner is used as a measure of the scanner resolution and
    spatial bandwidth. Recommendations for the design of scanners are presented, and
    include advice on the basic design of scanners, the media employed, operating
    temperature, scan rates, construction of survey probes, data processing, gradient
    symmetry, and the spatial resolution required for research and calibration applications.</p>
