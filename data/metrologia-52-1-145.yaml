abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Methods of absolute radiometric calibration of backscatter ultraviolet
    (BUV) satellite instruments are compared as part of an effort to minimize pre-launch
    calibration uncertainties. An internally illuminated integrating sphere source
    has been used for the Shuttle Solar BUV, Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, Ozone
    Mapping Instrument, and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 using standardized
    procedures traceable to national standards. These sphere-based spectral responsivities
    agree to within the derived combined standard uncertainty of 1.87% relative to
    calibrations performed using an external diffuser illuminated by standard irradiance
    sources, the customary spectral radiance responsivity calibration method for BUV
    instruments. The combined standard uncertainty for these calibration techniques
    as implemented at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Radiometric Calibration
    and Development Laboratory is shown to less than 2% at 250 nm when using a single
    traceable calibration standard.</p>
