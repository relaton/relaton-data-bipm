abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We discuss the treatment of the systematic frequency shifts
    due to microwave lensing and distributed cavity phase in Heavner et al 2014 Metrologia
    51 174–82. We explain that the microwave lensing frequency shift is generally
    non-zero and finite in the limit of no applied microwave field. This systematic
    error was incorrectly treated and we find that it contributes a significant frequency
    offset. Accounting for this shift implies that the measured microwave amplitude
    dependence (e.g. due to microwave leakage) is comparable to the total reported
    inaccuracy. We also discuss the importance of vertically aligning the fountain
    perpendicular to the axis of the cavity feeds, when the cavity has only two independent
    feeds. Finally, we note that background gas collisions have a different behavior
    for cold clock atoms than for clock atoms at room-temperature, and therefore room
    temperature measurements do not directly apply to laser-cooled clocks.</p>
