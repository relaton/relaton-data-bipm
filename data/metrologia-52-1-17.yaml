abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We report on the relative length fluctuation of two fixed-spacer
    Fabry–Pérot cavities with mirrors fabricated from silica/tantala dielectric coatings
    on fused silica substrates. By locking a laser to each cavity and reading out
    the beat note \n                  \n                  &#x03BD;&#x005E;=&#x03BD;1&#x2212;&#x03BD;2
    >\n                  \n                of the transmitted beams, we find that,
    for frequencies from 10 Hz to 1 kHz, the power spectral density of beat note fluctuation
    is \n                  \n                  S&#x03BD;&#x005E;(f)=(0.5Hz)2/f >.
    By careful budgeting of noise sources contributing to the beat note, we find that
    our measurement is consistent with the fluctuation in this band being dominated
    by the Brownian noise of the mirror coatings. Fitting for the coating loss angle
    ϕ<sub>c</sub>, we find it equal to 4 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. We then use a Bayesian
    analysis to combine our measurement with previous observations, and thereby extract
    estimates for the individual loss angles of the silica and tantala constituents
    of these coatings. With minor upgrades, the testbed described in this article
    can be used in the future to measure the length noise of cavities formed with
    novel mirror coating materials and geometries.</p>"
