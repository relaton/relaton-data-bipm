abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International System of Units (SI) is supposed to be coherent.
    That is, when a combination of units is replaced by an equivalent unit, there
    is no additional numerical factor. Here we consider dimensionless units as defined
    in the SI, e.g. angular units like radians or steradians and counting units like
    radioactive decays or molecules. We show that an incoherence may arise when different
    units of this type are replaced by a single dimensionless unit, the unit ‘one’,
    and suggest how to properly include such units into the SI in order to remove
    the incoherence. In particular, we argue that the radian is the appropriate coherent
    unit for angles and that hertz is not a coherent unit in the SI. We also discuss
    how including angular and counting units affects the fundamental constants.</p>
