abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measurements of mechanical quantities such as pressure often
    take place under dynamic conditions, yet no traceable standards for the primary
    dynamic calibration of pressure sensors currently exist. In theory, shock tubes
    can provide a close to perfect step-function ideal for the calibration of pressure
    transducers. In this paper we investigate a system consisting of a shock tube
    and an ultra-fast fiber-optical sensor that is designed to be a future primary
    system for dynamic pressure calibrations. For reference, the fiber-optical sensor
    is compared to a piezoelectric sensor, and their corresponding frequency spectra
    are calculated. Furthermore, an investigation of the repeatability of the fiber-optical
    sensor, as well as a comparison with a second shock tube, is performed.</p>
