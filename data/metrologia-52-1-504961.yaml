abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Results are presented from a series of comparisons between two
    independent femtosecond frequency comb systems at NPL, which were carried out
    in order to assess their systematic uncertainty. Simultaneous measurements with
    the two systems demonstrate agreement at the level of 5 × 10<sup>−18</sup> when
    measuring an optical frequency against a common microwave reference. When simultaneously
    measuring the ratio of two optical frequencies, agreement at the 3 × 10<sup>−21</sup>
    level is observed. The results represent the highest reported level of agreement
    to date between Ti:Sapphire and Er-doped femtosecond combs. The limitations of
    the combs when operating in these two different manners are discussed, including
    traceability to the SI second, which can be achieved with an uncertainty below
    1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. The technical details presented underpin recent absolute
    frequency measurements of the<sup>88</sup>Sr<sup>+</sup> and<sup>171</sup>Yb<sup>+</sup>
    optical clock transitions at NPL, as well as a frequency ratio measurement between
    the two optical clock transitions in<sup>171</sup>Yb<sup>+</sup>.</p>
