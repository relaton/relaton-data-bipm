abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Four platinum resistance thermometer data sets of resistance
    ratio as a function of temperature from 13.8033 K to 273.16 K are fitted to two
    different functions. One has the form of the ITS-90 reference function (the ‘Kemp
    model’) while the second is the mathematically more complex model of Nicholas.
    Both are shown to fit the resistivity data well, though the residuals for the
    Kemp model are lower. Both models also cope well with adjustments to the input
    temperatures consistent with the most recent consensus estimates of T–T<sub>90</sub>.
    In particular, the refitting of the data on which the low-temperature reference
    function of the ITS-90 is based to the Kemp functional form provides updated coefficients
    that could be part of a revised International Temperature Scale, or incorporated
    into the Mise en pratique for the kelvin. The residuals of both the Kemp and Nicholas
    models have similar magnitudes whether fitting either the original (W, T<sub>90</sub>)
    data pairs or the (W, T) data pairs obtained by adjusting the temperatures to
    incorporate the recent estimates of (T–T<sub>90</sub>). On that basis, there appears
    to be no evidence to suggest that either of the models is useful as an arbiter
    of thermodynamic temperature data—a reduction in the magnitude of the residuals
    might have been expected after revising the temperatures of the data pairs for
    better accord with thermodynamic temperature if a discriminating model function
    had such predictive ability.</p>
