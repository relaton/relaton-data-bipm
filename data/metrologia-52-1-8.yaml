abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A certified reference material (CRM) for poly(ethylene glycol)
    with no distribution in the degree of polymerization was developed. The degree
    of polymerization of the CRM was accurately determined to be 23. Supercritical
    fluid chromatography (SFC) was used to separate the molecularly uniform polymer
    from a standard commercial sample with wide polydispersity in its degree of polymerization.
    Through the use of a specific fractionation system coupled with SFC, we are able
    to obtain samples of poly(ethylene glycol) oligomer with exact degrees of polymerization,
    as required for a CRM produced by the National Metrology Institute of Japan.</p>
