    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this paper we describe a new solution of active delay stabilization for fibre-optic distribution of time and RF-frequency signals, which allows one to obtain both high precision and a potentially unlimited range of compensation of the fibre delay fluctuations. The solution is based on a hybrid system exploiting a pair of continuously tuned electronic variable delay lines, and a set of switched optical delays. We present a fully operational prototype of the time and frequency distribution setup based on this idea, which is capable of compensating more than 1 µs of the fiber delay fluctuations, and thus may be used in very long-haul links up to about 1000 km, without the need for any seasonal maintenance. We also report measurements of the time and frequency distribution stability, and the verification of the time transfer calibration.</p>
