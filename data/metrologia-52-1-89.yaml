abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The surface contamination of various metallic samples upon cyclic
    transfer from vacuum to ambient pressure air or dry nitrogen was studied using
    x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for surface chemical analysis. The venting
    methods were vacuum–air–vacuum, vacuum–N<sub>2</sub>–air–vacuum and vacuum–N<sub>2</sub>–vacuum.
    In addition, the dependence on the initial surface chemical state was investigated
    by using different cleaning methods such as the traditional washing and cleaning
    (nettoyage-lavage), low-pressure hydrogen plasma and UV/ozone as starting conditions.
    We found that cyclic exposure to air after UV/ozone and nettoyage-lavage has very
    little effect on the surface contamination. In contrast, hydrogen plasma removes
    the initial contamination almost completely. Until a first layer of contaminants
    is built up, the growth is very rapid but slows down exponentially with the number
    of cycles. Exposure directly to ambient pressure air causes the fastest and largest
    recontamination, followed by the cyclic transfer vacuum–N<sub>2</sub>–air–vacuum.
    Venting with dry nitrogen exclusively exhibits the slowest growth of contaminants
    but continues with further cycling until the first layer is completed. A list
    of precedence for existing and potential new materials and for the processes applied
    is presented in order to test and evaluate the best materials for future primary
    mass standards and to find the best working practice.</p>
