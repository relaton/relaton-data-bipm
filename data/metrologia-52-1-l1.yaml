    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The explicit use of the number ‘1’ in quotient-based expressions of units for intensive quantities involving counting, together with a full description of the quantity being measured, is recommended as an improvement on product-based expressions that omit the number 1 and do not fully explain the quantity presented. The benefits of these recommendations over proposals for new ‘units’ as special names for ‘one’ is also highlighted. In particular the nomenclature emphasizes the aspect of pure number counting associated with these quantities and helps to provide a distinction between intensive and extensive quantities which would otherwise be lost, especially if the quantity being measured is not fully described.</p>
