abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The explicit use of the number ‘1’ in quotient-based expressions
    of units for intensive quantities involving counting, together with a full description
    of the quantity being measured, is recommended as an improvement on product-based
    expressions that omit the number 1 and do not fully explain the quantity presented.
    The benefits of these recommendations over proposals for new ‘units’ as special
    names for ‘one’ is also highlighted. In particular the nomenclature emphasizes
    the aspect of pure number counting associated with these quantities and helps
    to provide a distinction between intensive and extensive quantities which would
    otherwise be lost, especially if the quantity being measured is not fully described.</p>
