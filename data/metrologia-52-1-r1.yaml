    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Since its first edition, published in 1984, the <italic>International Vocabulary of Metrology</italic> (VIM) has become a landmark for the language of measurement, and in its three editions it has evolved together with the evolution of measurement science and its applications. This paper discusses the fundamental features of the VIM as a concept system and proposes some highlights about the way in the VIM some basic and general concepts of measurement have changed their definitions in the last thirty years.</p>
