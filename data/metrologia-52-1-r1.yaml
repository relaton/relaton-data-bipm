abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Since its first edition, published in 1984, the International
    Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) has become a landmark for the language of measurement,
    and in its three editions it has evolved together with the evolution of measurement
    science and its applications. This paper discusses the fundamental features of
    the VIM as a concept system and proposes some highlights about the way in the
    VIM some basic and general concepts of measurement have changed their definitions
    in the last thirty years.</p>
