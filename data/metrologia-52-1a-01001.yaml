    <p>This report summarizes the results of the Key Comparison CCEM.RF-K25.W on high frequency power which has been performed between December 2010 and May 2013.</p>
    <p>In this comparison, the effective efficiency and calibration factor of two waveguide thermistor power sensors were determined by nine National Metrology Institutions (NMIs) in the frequency range 33 GHz to 50 GHz.</p>
