    <p>Under the auspices of the Committee Consultative of Electromagnetism, CCEM, the SIM Electromagnetic Working Group carried out a key comparison of power standards at 50/60 Hz. This key comparison, identified as SIM.EM-K5, aims to provide a link to various NMIs in the SIM region to the CCEM-K5 key comparison on 50/60 Hz power completed in 2001 and piloted by NIST. Measurements in the SIM.EM-K5 comparison were carried out from May 2010 to March 2012, including testing points of active and reactive power. CENAM was the pilot laboratory.</p><p>
    Differences between the measurement results of the participating laboratories and the reference value of this key comparison, calculated at each of all the testing points, show a good infrastructure of national standards of measurement of electric power in the SIM region.</p><p>
    Based on previous work, a link has been estimated between the results of the CCEM-K5 and the SIM.EM-K5 key comparisons, whose results were reported in 2002 and 2014, respectively. From the link it is shown that the measurement results of SIM.EM-K5 comparison are well supported.</p><p>
    The SIM.EM-K5 comparison is a rewording exercise of comparison of the national standards of measurement as recommended by the CIPM. The participating laboratories are fully recommended for their enthusiastic participation in the comparison. Their individual efforts to maintain the national standards of power measurement are acknowledged.</p>
