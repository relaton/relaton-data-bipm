    <p>The AC-DC difference of a set of current shunts produced by the Norwegian Metrology Service (Justervesenet), were measured by PTB and Justervesenet, in a bilateral comparison, where Justervesenet acted as the organizer and pilot laboratory. The nominal values of the current shunts are 30 mA, 100 mA, 300 mA, 1 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A and 20 A, which were measured at their nominal values for the frequencies 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 55 Hz, 110 Hz, 400 Hz, 1 kHz, 5 kHz, 10 kHz, 20 kHz, 50 kHz and 100 kHz. All current shunts were measured in combination with Planar Multi-junction Thermal Converters produced by PTB.</p><p>The results show that there is a degree of equivalence within 0.4 for all measured values, and that for frequencies below 10 kHz, the value is typically below 0.2. Hence, there is a very close agreement between the measurements, which are not correlated by traceability chains, and the properties of the current shunts have been documented by the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
