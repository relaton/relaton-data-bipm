abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Two bilateral capacitance comparisons between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) were carried out to demonstrate the significant improvements achieved in capacitance metrology by ICE. These comparisons were a follow-up to the 2006 SIM.EM-K4, -S3, and -S4 capacitance comparisons. These bilateral activities consist of capacitance comparison SIM.EM-K4.1, comparing a 10 pF fused-silica standard at 1000 Hz, and comparison SIM.EM-S4.1, comparing a 100 pF fused-silica standard at 1000 Hz. The result of these bilateral comparisons have provided improved degrees of equivalence between ICE and the participants of the SIM.EM-K4, -S3, and -S4 capacitance comparisons.</p><p>Main text.
