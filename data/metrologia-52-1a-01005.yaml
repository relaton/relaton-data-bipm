    <p>An intercomparison of 10 pF and 100 pF capacitance standards has taken place within the framework of COOMET. The intercomparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'—UMTS (Ukraine), has involved tree laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization—EURAMET (GUM, Poland). The results presented in this report appear to show that there are significant differences between some laboratories' representations of the farad. However, the agreement demonstrated by the intercomparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for the farad either via a calculable capacitor or via the quantum Hall reference standard of the BIPM.</p>
