  content: "<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison
    of the 1 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the Directorate
    of Measures and Precious Metals (DMDM), Beograd, Serbia, was carried out from
    January to March 2014. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke
    732B), BIPM_6 (Z6) and BIPM_A (ZA), were transported by freight to DMDM. At DMDM,
    the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage Standard. The output
    electromotive force of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison
    with the primary standard.</p>\n<p>At the BIPM, the travelling standards were
    calibrated, before and after the measurements at DMDM, with the Josephson Voltage
    Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the
    output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature and ambient atmospheric
    pressure.</p>\n<p>The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference
    between the values assigned to DC voltage standards by DMDM, at the level of 1.018
    V and 10 V, at DMDM, <italic>U</italic><sub>DMDM</sub>, and those assigned by
    the BIPM, at the BIPM, UBIPM, at the reference date of the 13 February 2014.</p>\n<p>\n<italic>U</italic><sub>DMDM</sub>
    − <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = 0.094 µV; \t<italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub>
    = 0.072 µV, at 1 V</p>\n<p>\n<italic>U</italic><sub>DMDM</sub> − <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>
    = 0.39 µV; \t<italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.12 µV, at 10 V</p>\n<p>where <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub>
    is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference,
    including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at
    DMDM, based on <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub>,  and the uncertainty related
    to the comparison.</p>\n<p>The results at the 10 V level are not covered by the
    uncertainties with a coverage factor of 2. After the distribution of the Draft
    A, the DMDM discovered that the pressure gauge was defective. Some considerations
    on the correction to apply on the comparison result and the corresponding uncertainties
    are presented in the report.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the above results fully cover
    the CMCs of DMDM which are significantly larger. No corrections for temperature
    and pressure are applied in calibrations for customers' secondary standards.\n</p>\n<p><bold>Main
