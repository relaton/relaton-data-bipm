  content: "<p>This report describes the results of supplementary comparison COOMET.EM-S8
    (also known as regional comparison COOMET 469/RU-a/09) of inductance standards
    of nominal values 0.1 μH to 100 μH, up to frequencies of 10 MHz. Six participants
    of the COOMET region were involved in the measurements carried out from July 2008
    to October 2011.</p>\n<p>All results, but one, agreed well with the comparison
    reference value. This fully confirms the uncertainties declared by the participants
    in the CMC database on the BIPM website. \n\n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
