    <p>This report describes the results of supplementary comparison COOMET.EM-S8 (also known as regional comparison COOMET 469/RU-a/09) of inductance standards of nominal values 0.1 μH to 100 μH, up to frequencies of 10 MHz. Six participants of the COOMET region were involved in the measurements carried out from July 2008 to October 2011.</p><p>All results, but one, agreed well with the comparison reference value. This fully confirms the uncertainties declared by the participants in the CMC database on the BIPM website.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
