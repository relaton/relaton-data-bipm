  content: "<p>This report describes the results of supplementary comparison COOMET.EM-S2
    (also known as regional comparison COOMET 344/UA/05) of AC power measurements
    at low frequency (50/53 Hz). Three participants were involved in the measurements
    carried out from 2008 to 2011, with the aim of supporting their Calibration and
    Measurement Capabilities (CMCs).</p>\n<p>The results of this comparison are described
    in the report. They show that the differences between almost all laboratory's
    values and the reference values are within the expanded measurement uncertainties
    at a coverage factor <italic>k</italic> = 2. \n\n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
