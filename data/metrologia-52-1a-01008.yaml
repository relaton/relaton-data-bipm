    <p>This report describes the results of supplementary comparison COOMET.EM-S2 (also known as regional comparison COOMET 344/UA/05) of AC power measurements at low frequency (50/53 Hz). Three participants were involved in the measurements carried out from 2008 to 2011, with the aim of supporting their Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs).</p><p>The results of this comparison are described in the report. They show that the differences between almost all laboratory's values and the reference values are within the expanded measurement uncertainties at a coverage factor k = 2.</p><p>Main text.
    To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
