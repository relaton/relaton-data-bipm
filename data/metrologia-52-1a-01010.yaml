    <p>Some years ago the EURAMET.EM-S24 comparison was performed in the field of small DC currents below 1 nA, initiated and coordinated by PTB, to compare the capabilities of thirteen European and non-European National Metrology Institutes for traceable calibrations of picoammeters. Late in the comparison, SP announced an interest to participate; instead, the bilateral comparison EURAMET.EM-S38 between SP and PTB was started. The measurements were made before any report of the EM-S24 was published. Hence, the same travelling standards, two different commercial picoammeters, could be used. They were calibrated at current values of ±100 fA, ±1 pA, ±10 pA and ±100 pA. Good agreement between the results of the participants was found.
