  content: "<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison
    of the 1 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National Institute
    for Standards (NIS), Giza, Egypt, was carried out from August to September 2014.
    Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_B (ZB) and
    BIPM_C (ZC), were transported as hand luggage on board an airplane to NIS and
    back to BIPM. At NIS, the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage
    Standard. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was
    measured by direct comparison with the primary standard. </p>\n<p>\nAt the BIPM,
    the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at
    NIS, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected
    for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature
    and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>\n<p>\nThe final result of the comparison
    is presented as the difference between the values assigned to DC voltage standards
    by NIS, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at NIS, <italic>U</italic><sub>NIS</sub>,
    and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>,
    at the reference date of the 7 September 2014. </p>\n<p>\n<italic>U</italic><sub>NIS</sub>
    - <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = 0.09 µV; \t<italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub>
    = 0.08 µV, at 1 V</p>\n<p>\n<italic>U</italic><sub>NIS</sub> - <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>
    = 0.22 µV; \t<italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.14 µV, at 10 V</p>\n<p>\nwhere
    <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated
    with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation
    of the volt at the BIPM and at NIS, based on <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub>,
    \ and the uncertainty related to the comparison.\nThis is a satisfactory result.
    The comparison result shows that the voltage standards maintained by NIS and the
    BIPM were equivalent, within their stated standard uncertainties, on the mean
    date of the comparison.\n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text
