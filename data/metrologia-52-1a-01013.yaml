    <p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of capacitance between the BIM (Bulgaria) and the BIPM carried out in 2012. Two 100 pF travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIM, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz and for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a.</p>
    <p>
    The results from the BIM and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95% confidence, <italic>k</italic> = 2) of 1.1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.
