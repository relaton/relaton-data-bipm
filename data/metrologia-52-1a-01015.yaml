  content: "<p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of capacitance
    between the NPLI (India) and the BIPM carried out in 2011. Two 10 pF travelling
    standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with
    an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM
    for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the NPLI, and finally
    again at the BIPM. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at frequencies
    of 1000 Hz and 1592 Hz, for a measuring voltage of 100 V. The BIPM was the pilot
    laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a.</p>\n<p>\nThe
    results from the NPLI and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a
    difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence, <italic>k</italic>
    = 2) of 1.0 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the
