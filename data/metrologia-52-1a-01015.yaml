    <p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of capacitance between the NPLI (India) and the BIPM carried out in 2011. Two 10 pF travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A–B–A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the NPLI, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at frequencies of 1000 Hz and 1592 Hz, for a measuring voltage of 100 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a.</p><p>
    The results from the NPLI and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence, k = 2) of 1.0 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
