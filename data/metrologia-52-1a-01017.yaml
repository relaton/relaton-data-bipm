  content: "<p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of capacitance
    between the NSAI-NML (Ireland) and the BIPM carried out in 2011. Two 10 pF travelling
    standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with
    an 'A—B—A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM
    for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the NSAI-NML, and
    finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance
    at a frequency of 1000 Hz for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot
    laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a.
    </p>\n<p>\nThe results from the NSAI-NML and the BIPM were found to be in good
    agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95
    % confidence, <italic>k</italic> = 2) of 2.5 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main
