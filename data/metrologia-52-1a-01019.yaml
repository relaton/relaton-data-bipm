    <p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison of the 1 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand), NIMT, was carried out from October to December 2014. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_A (ZA) and BIPM_6 (Z6), were transported by freight to NIMT and back to BIPM. At NIMT, the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage Standard. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the primary standard.</p><p>At the BIPM, the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at NIMT, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p><p>The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned toDC voltage standards by NIMT, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at NIMT, U<sub>NIMT</sub>, and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of 23 November 2014.</p><p>U<sub>NIMT</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = 0.16 mV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 0.14 mV, at 1 V</p><p>U<sub>NIMT</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = - 0.03 mV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 0.11 mV, at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at NIMT, based on K<sub>J-90</sub>,<sub></sub>and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
