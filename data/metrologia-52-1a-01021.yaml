    <p></p><p> As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.b, a comparison of the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National Standards Authority of Ireland – National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI - NML), Dublin, Ireland, was carried out in February and March 2015. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_6 (Z6) and BIPM_C (ZC), were transported by freight to NSAI-NML. At NSAI-NML, the reference standard for DC voltage at the 10 V level consists of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic voltage standards. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the group standard.</p><p>At the BIPM the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at NSAI-NML, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p><p>The final resultof the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned to DC voltage standards by NSAI - NML, at the level of 10 V,at NSAI - NML, U<sub>NML</sub>, and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of 24 February 2015.</p><p>U<sub>NML</sub> − U<sub>BIPM</sub> = - 0.82 mV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 1.35 mV, at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at NSAI-NML, based on K<sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
