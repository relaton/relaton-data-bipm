    <p> As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison of the 1 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the Justervesenet (JV), Kjeller, Norway, was carried out from January to February 2015. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_4 (Z4) and BIPM_5 (Z5), were transported by freight to JV and also back to BIPM. At JV, the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage Standard. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the primary standard.</p>
    <p>At the BIPM, the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at JV, withthe Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>
    <p>The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned toDC voltage standards by JV, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at JV, <italic>U</italic><sub>JV</sub>, and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of 28 January 2015.</p>
    <p><bold><italic>U</italic></bold><bold><sub>JV</sub></bold><bold> </bold>−<bold> <italic>U</italic><sub>BIPM</sub> = </bold><bold>0.23 </bold><bold>μ</bold><bold>V;  <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> = 0.03 </bold><bold>μ</bold><bold>V </bold>, <bold>at 1 V</bold></p>

    <p>where <italic>u</italic><sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at JV, based on <italic>K</italic><sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p>
