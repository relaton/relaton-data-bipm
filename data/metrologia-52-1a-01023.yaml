    <p>A key comparison of Ka-band (26.5 GHz to 40 GHz) antenna far-field gain, APMP.EM.RF-K3.F, has been carried out between KRISS (Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science) and NMIJ (National Metrology Institute of Japan) at 26.5 GHz, 33 GHz and 40 GHz. The bilateral comparison used the protocol based on that used in the keycomparison CCEM.RF-K3.F to link this comparison tothe CCEM.RF-K3.F. The KRISS participated in CCEM.RF-K3.F acted as the pilot and linking laboratory for the comparison.</p>
