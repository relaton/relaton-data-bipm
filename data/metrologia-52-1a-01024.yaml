abstract:
- content: "<p> The 10 V Josephson voltage standard of BelGIM was compared with the
    similar standard of VNIIM in August-November 2014 in accordance with the option
    B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol. The standard of VNIIM based upon the
    Josephson effect was used as a transfer standard to measure the output voltage
    by BelGIM. The final results are in very good agreement with the reference value
    supplied by the BIPM voltage standard: the relative voltage difference was 6·10<sup>-12</sup>
    at the combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.8·10<sup>-10</sup> for the
    nominal voltage of 10 V.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To reach the main text of this

    B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
