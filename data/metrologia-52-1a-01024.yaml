    <p> The 10 V Josephson voltage standard of BelGIM was compared with the similar standard of VNIIM in August-November 2014 in accordance with the option B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol. The standard of VNIIM based upon the Josephson effect was used as a transfer standard to measure the output voltage by BelGIM. The final results are in very good agreement with the reference value supplied by the BIPM voltage standard: the relative voltage difference was 6·10<sup>-12</sup> at the combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.8·10<sup>-10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p>
