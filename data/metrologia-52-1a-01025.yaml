    <p>A comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Braunschweig, Germany, was carried out in October 2014 at the level of 10 V. For this exercise, options A and B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol were applied. Option B required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by PTB using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. Option A required PTB to provide a reference voltage with its Josephson voltage standard for measurement by the BIPM using an analogue nanovoltmeter and associated measurement loop.</p>
    <p>The final results were in good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 3.9 parts in 10<sup>11</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p>
