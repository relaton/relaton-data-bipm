abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards of the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    (PTB), Braunschweig, Germany, was carried out in October 2014 at the level of
    10 V. For this exercise, options A and B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol
    were applied. Option B required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement
    by PTB using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. Option A required
    PTB to provide a reference voltage with its Josephson voltage standard for measurement
    by the BIPM using an analogue nanovoltmeter and associated measurement loop.</p><p>The
    final results were in good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty
    of 3.9 parts in 10<sup>11</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
