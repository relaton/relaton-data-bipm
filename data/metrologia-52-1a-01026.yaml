    <p>This is a report of the results of the Interamerican Metrology System (SIM) comparison on high resistance values, performed to compare the measurement capabilities of NIST and ICE-LMVE and for establishing the degree of equivalence between those laboratories.</p>
    <p>During February 2014, two resistance standards were used as traveling standards for measurements in those countries, with NIST-USA acting as pilot laboratory. Results for five measurement points are presented as errors relative to a comparison reference value together with their uncertainty.</p>
