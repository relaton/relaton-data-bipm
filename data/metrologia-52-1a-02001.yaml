    <p>This report describes the EURAMET comparison for luminous flux carried out at 12 participating national metrology laboratories (NMIs). </p>
    <p>More than a decade ago, the CCPR initialised a key comparison for luminous flux denoted as CCPR K4. The reference value CCPR-KCRV for luminous flux is maintained since that time by the participants of that early CCPR comparison. Beside the pilot laboratory, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), two additional former participants acted as link laboratories for this EURAMET-Key-Comparison. The luminous flux CCPR-KCRV, maintained at the link laboratories and transferred by batches of incandescent lamps, was used to evaluate a reference value (EURAMET-RV) at the pilot laboratory as a weighted luminous flux average for this comparison.</p>
    <p>Finally, the realized or preserved luminous flux values of all other participants were compared with the EURAMET-RV in a star-type comparison at the pilot with batches of three to six lamps of various types. The DOEs of the values of the participants with respect to the reference value and mutually with all other luminous flux values are evaluated and published in the report together with the associated uncertainties. The deviations from the EURAMET-RV and hence from the CCPR-KCRV are within the declared expanded uncertainties for all participants.</p>
