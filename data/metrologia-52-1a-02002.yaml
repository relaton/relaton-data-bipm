    <p>KRISS, NMISA, CMS/ITRI, NMC-A*STAR, NMIJ/AIST, NMIA, NML-SIRIM, NIM, and VNIIOFI conducted a supplementary comparison on the fiber optic power responsivity at 1310 nm and 1550 nm. The aim of this comparison was to examine the equivalence of the fiber optic power responsivity among participating laboratories and to provide supporting evidence for associated CMC claims in BIPM KCDB.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the realized or preserved luminous flux values of all other participants were compared with the EURAMET-RV in a star-type comparison at the pilot with batches of three to six lamps of various types. The DOEs of the values of the participants with respect to the reference value and mutually with all other luminous flux values are evaluated and published in the report together with the associated uncertainties. The deviations from the EURAMET-RV and hence from the CCPR-KCRV are within the declared expanded uncertainties for all participants.</p>
