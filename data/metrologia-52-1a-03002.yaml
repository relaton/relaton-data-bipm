    <p>An International Comparison on industrial Platinum Resistance Thermometers (PRTs) among the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of Spain, Panama, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Nicaragua began in 2013 and was successfully completed in 2014. Two PRTs were circulated (hand carried) and compared in the range from -38.8 °C up to 250 °C. The Centro Español de Metrología (Spanish NMI), CEM, acted as the pilot laboratory providing the reference value of the comparison.</p><p>The thermometers have shown an acceptable behavior throughout the comparison, therefore the results can be considered valid for comparing the measurement capabilities of the participant laboratories. The equivalence between the participant laboratories in the calibration of platinum resistance thermometers by comparison in the range from -38,8 °C up to 250 °C has been demonstrated in almost all cases.</p><p>This report presents the results of this comparison and provides detailed information of the measurements performed by the participating laboratories.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
