    <p>A comparison of capsule-type standard platinum resistance thermometers (CSPRT) was carried out between NRC (Canada), NMIJ (Japan), and INRIM (Italy) over the temperature range 13.8 K to 273.16 K. The principal goal was to link the NMIJ realization of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 to the results of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry Key Comparison CCT-K2 over this temperature range. Additionally, in the intervening years since the CCT-K2 measurements were carried out, INRIM has improved the Italian national standards in the temperature range of the comparison, and was interested in the opportunity to update that assessment. The comparison has revealed the calibrations at NMIJ to be in agreement with the KCRV of CCT-K2 within the expanded uncertainty for all temperatures of the comparison. The linkage to the CCT-K2 data supports the inclusion of the NMIJ CMCs in Appendix C of the KCDB. The INRIM data are also consistent with the KCRV of CCT-K2 within the expanded uncertainty of the comparison.</p><p>Main text.
