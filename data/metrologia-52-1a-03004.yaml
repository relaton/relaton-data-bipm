  content: "<p>The Consultative Committee for Thermometry has organized Key Comparison
    9 (CCT-K9) as an updated replacement for CCT-K3. A comparison of the fixed-point
    temperature standards of Peru with those of Canada was carried out following a
    protocol that closely resembles CCT-K9. The comparison was limited to the fixed
    points of tin and zinc, with NRC the pilot laboratory and the eventual link to
    CCT-K9 (currently, CCT-K9 remains a work in progress). The comparison protocol
    required INDECOPI to select, characterize, and transport (i.e. hand carry) the
    SPRTs to NRC. Following the measurements at NRC, the SPRTs were returned and re-measured
    at INDECOPI to close the loop and assess any changes that occurred in the SPRTs
    over the course of the measurements. The following degrees of equivalence, <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">D</italic>, and expanded uncertainties, <italic toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>
    (<italic toggle=\"yes\">k</italic>  = 2), were obtained via this comparison.</p>\n<p>\n

    \           </p>\n<p>\nSIM.T-K9.1 has demonstrated the compatibility of the fixed
    points of INDECOPI with those maintained by NRC within the combined uncertainties,
    and therefore serves to verify the intended calibration and measurement capabilities
    envisioned for INDECOPI, Peru. The results can be linked to NMIs globally following
    CCT-K9, with NRC as the linking participant.</p>\n<p>\n               <bold>Main
