abstract:
- content: "<p>A key comparison in dew-point temperature was carried out among the
    national standards held by NPL (pilot), NMIJ, INTA, VSL, INRIM, MIKES, NIST, NIM,
    VNIIFTRI-ESB and NMC. A pair of condensation-principle dew-point hygrometers was
    circulated and used to compare the local realisations of dew point for participant
    humidity generators in the range −50 °C to +20 °C. The duration of the comparison
    was prolonged by numerous problems with the hygrometers, requiring some repairs,
    and several additional check measurements by the pilot. Despite the problems and
    the extended timescale, the comparison was effective in providing evidence of
    equivalence.  Agreement with the key comparison reference value was achieved in
    the majority of cases, and bilateral degrees of equivalence are also reported.</p><p>
