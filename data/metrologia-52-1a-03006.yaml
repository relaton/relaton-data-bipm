abstract:
- content: |-
    <p> At the meeting of the Technical Committee 1.10 of COOMET in 2007 it was decided to undertake a regional comparison between the VNIIM (Russian Federation) and the NSC IM (Ukraine) for realization of the ITS-90 at the freezing point of copper in the field of non-contact thermometry. The VNIIM participated in the key comparisons CCT-K5. As a consequence, the VNIIM therefore acts as the linking institute for this comparison, registered in the KCDB as COOMET.T-K5, to disseminate metrological equivalence to the NSC IM standards (Ukraine).</p><p>

    The protocol of the comparison covers two separate comparisons: a comparison of fixed-point cells (Stage 1), and a comparison of lamp calibrations (Stage 2) at 1084.62 °C. The results of the Stage 2 comparison are used in this report for linkage with the CCT-K5.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT WG-KC, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
