  content: "<p> At the meeting of the Technical Committee 1.10 of COOMET in 2007 it
    was decided to undertake a regional comparison between the VNIIM (Russian Federation)
    and the NSC IM (Ukraine) for realization of the ITS-90 at the freezing point of
    copper in the field of non-contact thermometry. The VNIIM participated in the
    key comparisons CCT-K5. As a consequence, the VNIIM therefore acts as the linking
    institute for this comparison, registered in the KCDB as COOMET.T-K5, to disseminate
    metrological equivalence to the NSC IM standards (Ukraine).</p>\n<p>\n\nThe protocol
    of the comparison covers two separate comparisons: a comparison of fixed-point
    cells (Stage 1), and a comparison of lamp calibrations (Stage 2) at 1084.62 °C.
    The results of the Stage 2 comparison are used in this report for linkage with
    the CCT-K5.                         \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT WG-KC,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
