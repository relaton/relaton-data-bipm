  content: "<p>Regional comparison of type S thermocouples at the freezing points
    of zinc, aluminium and copper was initiated by COOMET TC1.1-10 (the technical
    committee of COOMET `Thermometry and thermal physics'). Three NMI take part in
    COOMET regional comparison: D I Mendeleev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM) (Russian
    Federation), National Scientific Centre (Institute of Metrology) (NSC IM, Ukraine),
    \ Republic State Enterprise (Kazakhstan Institute of Metrology) (KazInMetr, Republic
    of Kazakhstan). VNIIM (Russia) was chosen as the coordinator-pilot of the regional
    comparison.</p>\n<p>\n\nA star type comparison was used. The participants: KazInMetr
    and NSC IM constructed the type S thermocouples and calibrated them in three fixed
    points: zinc, aluminum and copper points, using methods of ITS-90 fixed point
    realizations.                         \n</p>\n<p>\nThe thermocouples have been
    sent to VNIIM together with the results of the calibration at three fixed points,
    with the values of the inhomogeneity at temperature 200 °C and the uncertainty
    evaluations of the results. For calibration of thermocouples the same VNIIM fixed
    points cells were used. Participating laboratories repeated the calibration of
    thermocouples after its returning in zinc, aluminum and copper points to determine
    the stability of its results.                         \n</p>\n<p>\nIn result of
    the comparison was to evaluate the equivalence of the type S thermocouples calibration
    in fixed points by NMIs to confirm corresponding lines of international website
    for NMI's Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMC).                         \n</p>\n<p>\nThis
    paper is the final report of the comparison including analysis of the uncertainty
    of measurement results.                        \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
