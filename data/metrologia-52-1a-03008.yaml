  content: "<p>A Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) Key Comparison of dew/frost
    point temperatures was carried out by the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST, USA) and the National Research Council (NRC, Canada) between
    December 2014 and April 2015. The results of this comparison are reported here,
    along with descriptions of the humidity laboratory standards for NIST and NRC
    and the uncertainty budget for these standards. This report also describes the
    protocol for the comparison and presents the data acquired. The results are analyzed,
    determining degree of equivalence between the dew/frost-point standards of NIST
    and NRC.</p>\n<p>\nThis paper is the final report of the comparison including
    analysis of the uncertainty of measurement results.                        \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main
