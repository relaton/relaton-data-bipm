    <p>The thickness of nickel layers were compared on steel samples. The measurand is the layer/coating thickness. In the case of area mass measurements the amount is given as layer thickness by using the reference value of the density of Ni (8.90 g/cm<sup>3</sup> according to GOST 9.302-88).</p><p>
    For nine reference materials that were used to compare the measurement standards of UNIIM and PTB, the En-factor is less than 1, which indicates that the measurement standards are equivalent in the range of coating thickness from 4 μm to 100 μm and surface density from 40 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 900 g/m<sup>2</sup>. But the comparison of the UNIIM and PTB measurement standards should be continued in the range of coating thickness from 1 μm to 5 μm.</p><p>Main text.
