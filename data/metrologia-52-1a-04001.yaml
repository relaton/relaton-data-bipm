  content: "<p>The thickness of nickel layers were compared on steel samples. The
    measurand is the layer/coating thickness. In the case of area mass measurements
    the amount is given as layer thickness by using the reference value of the density
    of Ni (8.90 g/cm<sup>3</sup> according to GOST 9.302-88).</p>\n<p>\nFor nine reference
    materials that were used to compare the measurement standards of UNIIM and PTB,
    the En-factor is less than 1, which indicates that the measurement standards are
    equivalent in the range of coating thickness from 4 μm to 100 μm and surface density
    from 40 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 900 g/m<sup>2</sup>. But the comparison of the UNIIM
    and PTB measurement standards should be continued in the range of coating thickness
    from 1 μm to 5 μm. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text

    comparison was registered as the supplementary comparison EURAMET.L-S24. The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL WG-MRA,
