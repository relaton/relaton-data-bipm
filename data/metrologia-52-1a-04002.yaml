  content: "<p>The report summarizes a comparison of frequency stabilized He-Ne/I2
    lasers, which may be used as frequency or length standards. The goal was to confirm
    the declared measuring capabilities of these frequencies and to determine degree
    of equivalence of the national length measurement standards of the participating
    countries.</p>\n<p>\nThe measurements in the comparison include measurement of
    the lasers' frequency stability and frequency reproducibility. The comparison
    format was a circular comparison and the lasers of three national metrology institutes
    have been delivered to VNIIM during the period from June 2009 to September 2011.
    Measurements were made by beat-frequency comparison with laser VNIIM02 which had
    previously participated in comparison CCL-K11.\nFrequency differences between
    0.6 kHz and 12.5 kHz were obtained, with Allan Deviations ranging from 1.05 ×
    10<sup>-12</sup> (τ=160 s) to 5.72 × 10<sup>-12</sup>  (τ=10 s).  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
