  content: "<p>The results of the comparison of parallel thread gauges between ten
    European countries are presented. Three thread plugs and three thread rings were
    calibrated in one loop. Croatian National Laboratory for Length (HMI/FSB-LPMD)
    acted as the coordinator and pilot laboratory of the comparison. Thread angle,
    thread pitch, simple pitch diameter and pitch diameter were measured. Pitch diameters
    were calibrated within 1a, 2a, 1b and 2b calibration categories in accordance
    with the EURAMET cg-10 calibration guide. A good agreement between the measurement
    results and differences due to different calibration categories are analysed in
    this paper. This comparison was a first EURAMET comparison of parallel thread
    gauges based on the EURAMET ctg-10 calibration guide, and has made a step towards
    the harmonization of future comparisons with the registration of CMC values for
    thread gauges.  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of
