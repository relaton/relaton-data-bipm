abstract:
- content: "<p>The Inter-American Metrology System (SIM) has carried out a key comparison
    of diameter measurements. The artifacts studied were four ring gages and four
    plug gages. The measurand was a specified diameter of each gauge at 20 °C and
    corrected to zero force.  This report presents results obtained by the individual
    participants and an analysis of the results and their uncertainties. The results
    are in good agreement with one another, well within the range expected based on
    the measurement uncertainties claimed by the participants.</p><p> Main text. \nTo

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
