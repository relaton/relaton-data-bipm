    <p>The Inter-American Metrology System (SIM) has carried out a key comparison of diameter measurements. The artifacts studied were four ring gages and four plug gages. The measurand was a specified diameter of each gauge at 20 °C and corrected to zero force.  This report presents results obtained by the individual participants and an analysis of the results and their uncertainties. The results are in good agreement with one another, well within the range expected based on the measurement uncertainties claimed by the participants.</p>
