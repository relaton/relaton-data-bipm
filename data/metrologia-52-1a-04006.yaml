    <p>Lasers from three national metrological institutes (NMIs) were compared in 2013 as part of the CCL-K11 ongoing key comparison, initiated by the 13th meeting of the Comité Consultative des Longuers (CCL) in 2007. The absolute frequency of R(127) 11-5 transitions of molecular iodine was measured for these lasers following the technical protocol for CCL-K11. The results of these measurements are compiled in this report. The comparison reports, as communicated by each participant, are included as appendices.</p><p>
    This document constitutes the fifth final report for the ongoing key comparison CCL-K11.</p><p>Main text.
