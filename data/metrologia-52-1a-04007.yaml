    <p>The results of the bilateral comparison on line-scale between French (LNE) and Indonesian (KIM-LIPI) NMI for length is presented. A 300 mm long line-scale was calibrated by both participants. LNE acted as the coordinator and pilot laboratory. The measurand was the distance to a reference line labelled '0', 39 distances out of the 300 available were calibrated. Results showed a good agreement between both participants and will help KIM-LIPI to support new CMC values.</p><p>Main text.
