  content: "<p>The results of the bilateral comparison on line-scale between French
    (LNE) and Indonesian (KIM-LIPI) NMI for length is presented. A 300 mm long line-scale
    was calibrated by both participants. LNE acted as the coordinator and pilot laboratory.
    The measurand was the distance to a reference line labelled '0', 39 distances
    out of the 300 available were calibrated. Results showed a good agreement between
    both participants and will help KIM-LIPI to support new CMC values. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main
