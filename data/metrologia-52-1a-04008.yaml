    <p>In 2000, a key comparison, CCL-K3 (optical polygon and angle blocks) was started, piloted by NMISA. Based on it, in 2007, the SIM metrological region started a SIM.L-K3 key comparison piloted by INMETRO. The results of this regional comparison (RMO key comparison) contribute to the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) between the national metrology institutes of the Metre Convention. It is linked with the CCL-K3 key comparison via laboratories that participated in both the CIPM and the RMO comparisons. This common participation establishes the link between the comparisons and ensures equivalence of national metrology institutes, according to the MRA between NMIs. The SIM NMIs that took part in the CCL-K3 were NIST, NRC and CENAM. However, NRC withdrew from it. GUM from Poland (EURAMET) and NPLI from India (APMP) were invited to participate in the SIM.L-K3 key comparison. The circulation of artefacts (a 12 faces polygon and 4 angle blocks) started in 2008 and was completed in 2009.</p><p>Main text.
