  content: "<p>In 2000, a key comparison, CCL-K3 (optical polygon and angle blocks)
    was started, piloted by NMISA. Based on it, in 2007, the SIM metrological region
    started a SIM.L-K3 key comparison piloted by INMETRO. The results of this regional
    comparison (RMO key comparison) contribute to the Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA) between the national metrology institutes of the Metre Convention. It is
    linked with the CCL-K3 key comparison via laboratories that participated in both
    the CIPM and the RMO comparisons. This common participation establishes the link
    between the comparisons and ensures equivalence of national metrology institutes,
    according to the MRA between NMIs. The SIM NMIs that took part in the CCL-K3 were
    NIST, NRC and CENAM. However, NRC withdrew from it. GUM from Poland (EURAMET)
    and NPLI from India (APMP) were invited to participate in the SIM.L-K3 key comparison.
    The circulation of artefacts (a 12 faces polygon and 4 angle blocks) started in
    2008 and was completed in 2009. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the
