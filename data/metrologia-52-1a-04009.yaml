  content: "<p>This supplementary comparison concerns the calibration of gauge blocks
    by mechanical comparison, which is a technique of paramount importance as it is
    at the highest level in the traceability chain of length for most countries of
    the American Continent. This comparison is designed to support the submitted CMC
    claims of these countries.</p>\n<p>The measurand is the central length of several
    gauge blocks as defined in ISO 3650 and the circulated gauge blocks were used
    for two comparisons carried out in two stages: the first stage, SIM.L-K1:2007,
    Calibration of gauge blocks by optical interferometry (2007–2010); the gauge blocks
    were also measured by mechanical comparison for those NMI also participating in
    SIM.L-S6:2007; the second stage, SIM.L-S6:2007, Calibration of gauge blocks by
    mechanical comparison (2010–2011) for the participants that measured only by mechanical
    comparison.</p>\n<p>In this second comparison there were 16 participants, 14 from
    the Americas, and 2 invited NMIs from other regions. The circulation in the second
    stage had 10 participants.                      \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
