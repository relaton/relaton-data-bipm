  content: "<p>A round robin comparison in calibration of gauge blocks by mechanical
    comparison methods between NMIs of Arab countries in addition to the NMI of South
    Africa was carried out during the period of November 2011 to July 2013, The Arab
    Federation for Metrology (AFM) identification number for this comparison is: ARABMET
    L.S.1. NIS-Egypt acted as the pilot laboratory. One set of gauge blocks, with
    nominal size: 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 40 mm, 90 mm were circulated. This comparison
    was registered in the BIPM KCDB in June 2012 as an AFRIMETS supplementary comparison
    under the identifier AFRIMETS.L-S3. The results obtained are presented in this
    report. Coordination of the programme has been done by the AFM technical support
    unit. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this paper,
