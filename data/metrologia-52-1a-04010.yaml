- content: |-
    <p>A round robin comparison in calibration of gauge blocks by mechanical comparison methods between NMIs of Arab countries in addition to the NMI of South Africa was carried out during the period of November 2011 to July 2013, The Arab Federation for Metrology (AFM) identification number for this comparison is: ARABMET L.S.1. NIS-Egypt acted as the pilot laboratory. One set of gauge blocks, with nominal size: 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 40 mm, 90 mm were circulated. This comparison was registered in the BIPM KCDB in June 2012 as an AFRIMETS supplementary comparison under the identifier AFRIMETS.L-S3. The results obtained are presented in this report. Coordination of the programme has been done by the AFM technical support unit.</p><p>Main text.
