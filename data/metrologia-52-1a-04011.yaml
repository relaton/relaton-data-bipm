abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of the bilateral comparison on line-scale between French
    (LNE) and Indonesian (KIM-LIPI) NMI for length, is presented. 5 angle blocks (5'',
    5', 30', 5°, 30°) were measured by both participants. LNE acted as the coordinator
    and pilot laboratory. The results showed a disagreement between both participants
    mainly for the 5' angle block due to geometrical defects.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To
