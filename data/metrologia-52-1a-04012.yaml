    <p>A bilateral comparison of measurements on a Type A1 roughness standard has been undertaken between metrology institutes in Ukraine and Russia. The measurand was the parameter <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
                   <sub>max</sub>, located on two different sections of the artefact with nominal values of 0.250 μm and 49 μm. The results of the two participants are in agreement within the combined uncertainties, thus equivalence of the measurements is demonstrated.</p>
