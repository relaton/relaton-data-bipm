- content: |-
    <p>The PTB submitted directly to the SIR one ampoule of<sup>166m</sup>Ho prepared from a dilution of the solution distributed to four laboratories participating in the EURAMET.RI(II)-K2.Ho-166m comparison in 2013. No attempt to evaluate a new KCRV has been made and the usual procedure was applied to link the results of the comparison to the usual SIR entries through the PTB. One NMI used this K2 comparison to update its previous degree of equivalence which is older than 20 years. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the International Reference System (SIR) and the KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table for the four remaining laboratories in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ho166m comparison, the six laboratories in the regional comparison APMP.RI(II)-K2.Ho166m and the four laboratories in the regional EURAMET.RI(II)-K2.Ho-166m comparison. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
