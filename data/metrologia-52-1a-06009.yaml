    <p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), Beijing, China, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beam of the BIPM in September 2014. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the NIM and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9967 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.1 × 10<sup>-3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text.
