    <p>In 2010, the Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais–Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (LNE–LNHB) submitted one sample of known activity of <sup>207</sup>Bi to the International Reference System for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Bi-207. The value of the activity submitted was about 180 kBq. There is now one result in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Bi-207 comparison. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been evaluated for the first time using the LNE–LNHB result and a PTB result dating 1982. The degree of equivalence between the LNE–LNHB equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the KCRV has been calculated and is reported.
