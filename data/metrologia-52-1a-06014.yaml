abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison of air kerma-length product determinations for standard
    radiation qualities defined for use in computed tomography  was performed between
    the PTB and the IAEA as EURAMET project #1327, registered in the KCDB as the EURAMET.RI(I)-S12
    comparison. A pencil type reference-class ionization chamber of the IAEA and the
    three RQT beam qualities established according to the IEC standard 61627:2005
    were selected for the comparison. The calibration coefficients for the transfer
    chamber in terms of Gycm/C at the PTB and the IAEA using the partial irradiation
    method recommended in the IAEA TRS 457 were determined. The results show the calibration
    coefficients of both laboratories were in a very good agreement of about 0.2 %
    well within the estimated relative standard uncertainty of the comparison of about
    0.8 %. Residual correction due to the additional aperture required for partial
    irradiation of pencil chambers and feasibility of the full irradiation method
    were also studied.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click

    BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
