    <p>In 2008, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) submitted one sample of known activity of 56Mn to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Mn-56. The value of the activity submitted was about 290 kBq. There is now one result in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Mn-56 comparison. The key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been evaluated for the first time using the NPL result and a BIPM result dating November 1978. The degree of equivalence between the NPL equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the KCRV has been calculated and is reported.</p>
