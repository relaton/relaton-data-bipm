    <p>The comparison for the calibration of ambient dose equivalent meter was organized by TCRI of APMP. Seven laboratories (ARPANSA, BARC, INER, KRISS, NIM, NMIJ, and VNIIM) participated in the comparison exercise. Two moderator-type neutron ambient dose equivalent meters (one cylindrical and the other spherical) were circulated and calibrated in ISO standard neutron fields of<sup>252</sup>Cf,<sup>241</sup>Am-Be, and D<sub>2</sub>O moderated<sup>252</sup>Cf sources. The stability of the transfer instruments was checked by the pilot lab (KRISS) between the measurements of two successive participants. Some outliers exist in each measurement set and the weighted means of all measurement results are not adequate as a reference value because of the large chi-square values. The median was used to calculate the reference value.</p><p>Main text.
