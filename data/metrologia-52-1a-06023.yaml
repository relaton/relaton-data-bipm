- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Istituto Nazionale di Metrologia delle Radiazioni Ionizzanti (ENEA-INMRI), Italy and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in June 2015. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the ENEA and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9999 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p> Main text</p><p>
