abstract:
- content: "<p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the ENEA-INMRI, Italy and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams. The results
    show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty
    for the comparison of 4.8 parts in 103. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on
    Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM
    key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
