    <p>The EURAMET.M.FF-K6 comparison was organized for the purpose of determination of the degree of equivalence of the primary (national) standards for low-pressure gas flow measurement over the range (2 to 100) m<sup>3</sup>/h and was performed simultaneously with CCM.FF-K6.2011 with the same transfer standard. A rotary gas meter G65 was used as a transfer standard. The measurements were provided by prescribed reference conditions.</p><p>
    Fifteen laboratories from EURAMET participated in this key comparison - SMU, Slovakia; PTB, Germany; CEM, Spain; LNE-LADG, France; VSL, Netherlands; CMI, Czech Republic; BEV, Austria; MKEH, Hungary; GUM Poland; SP, Sweden; METAS, Switzerland; DMDM, Serbia; TUBITAK-UME, Turkey; EIM, Greece; IMBiH, Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p><p>
    The EURAMET.M.FF-K6 is linked to the CCM.FF-K6.2011 by correcting the results of three linking laboratories (Slovakia SMU, Germany PTB and France LNE LADG). This correction provides an estimate of what would have been the result from the EURAMET.M-FF-K6 participants, if they had actually participated in CCM.FF-K6.2011.</p><p>
    According to the evaluation 93.7 % of the results were consistent with KCRV, 3.4 % of the results were in the warning level and 2.9 % of the results were inconsistent.</p><p>The results of this comparison can be used for review of the CMC tables.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
