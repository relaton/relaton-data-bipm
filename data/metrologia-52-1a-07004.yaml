abstract:
- content: "<p>In order to show equivalence in mass standards calibration among National
    Metrology Institutes of member countries of the 'Comité international des poids
    et mesures' (CIPM), key comparisons of mass standards have been carried out under
    the auspices of the 'Comité Consultatif pour la Masse et les Grandeurs Apparentées'
    (CCM).</p><p>This key comparison on 50 kg standards in standard stainless steel
    was based on the decision of the CCM during the 11th meeting held in April 2008
    at the 'Bureau International des Poids et Mesures' (BIPM).</p><p>For this key
    comparison CENAM—Mexico acted as pilot laboratory, and NPL—United Kingdom accepted
    to be co-pilot laboratory.</p><p>The aims of this key comparison were to compare
    the results obtained by NMIs in calibration of 50 kg stainless steel weights and
    to repeat the exercise realized in 2001–2002 with the key comparison identified
    as CCM.M-K3.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the main text of this paper, click on
    \ Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by CCM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
