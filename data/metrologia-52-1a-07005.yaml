    <p>This report describes the results of international comparison COOMET.M.M-S1 (also known as supplementary comparison COOMET 581/GE/12). The comparison measurements between the two participants GEOSTM (pilot laboratory) and PTB were started in August 2012 and finished in June 2013.</p>
    <p>The transfer standards were OIML Class E2 standard weights with nominal mass values of 1 kg, 10 g and 50 mg.  Agreement between the two participants is good.</p>
