  content: "<p>A torque key comparison coded CCM.T-K1.3 was conducted at the torques
    of 0 N m, 500 N m and 1000 N m as an extension of the key comparison CCM.T-K1
    between two laboratories, Korea Research Institute of Science and Standards (KRISS)
    and National Institute of Standard (NIS) in Egypt. KRISS, who joined CCM.T-K1
    key comparison in 2005, piloted this comparison and played a role of a link laboratory.
    Comparison results show that NIS torques at 0 N m, 500 N m, and 1000 N m are equivalent
    to KCRVs of CCM.T-K1.  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text
