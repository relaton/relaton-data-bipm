    <p>This project was a European regional bilateral key comparison of stainless steel standards of 100 mg, 2 g, 20 g, and 500 g as a submultiple of the kilogram carried out under the auspices of EURAMET and designated project 1345. This comparison is also a KCDB Regional Key Comparison, registered as EURAMET.M.M-K2.6.</p><p>The objectives of the comparison were to check the measurement capabilities in the field of mass of BEV and provide a basis for the review of new calibration measurement capabilities (CMC).</p><p>Results are linked to the key comparison reference values of CCM.M-K2.</p><p>BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory and the provider of the transfer standards. NPL provided the link to the CCM KC and MKEH collected the measurement data and helped to ensure impartiality.</p><p>Main text.
