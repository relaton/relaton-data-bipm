- content: |-
    <p>By agreement at the 10th WGFF meeting, the international comparison CCM.FF-K4.1.2011, for volume of liquids at 20 L and 100 mL, was performed during 2012â€“2014. Specially designed stainless steel pipettes were used as transfer standards for 20 L, whereas commercially available pycnometers were used for 100 mL. No discrepant measurements were distinguished on the 20 L artifacts. The largest difference between two NMIs was 0.0042 %, whereas the average degrees of equivalence for artifacts 710-04 and 710-05 resulted in 0.0001 % and 0.0005 %, respectively. Only one participant produced anomalous results for 100 mL measurements and results for artifacts 03.01.16 and 03.01.17 were all fully consistent with each other. The average degrees of equivalence for artifacts 03.01.16 and 03.01.17 were 0.00017 % and 0.0011 %, respectively.</p><p>Main text.
