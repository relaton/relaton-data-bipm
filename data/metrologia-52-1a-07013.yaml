    <p>The Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) took part and failed to prove equivalence in the Key Comparison CCM.P-K12 of helium leak artefacts (leak rates) into vacuum. After identifying and eliminating the cause of the failure, the Institute of Metals and Technology (IMT) of Slovenia, a successful participant in CCM.P-K12, volunteered to serve as pilot and link in a following bilateral comparison of IMT and CMI that obtained designation CCM.P-K12.1 in June 2012. It was decided to perform the comparison with a glass permeation helium leak artefact at nominally 3·10<sup>-11</sup> mol/s (7.4·10<sup>-7</sup> mbar·L·s<sup>-1</sup>) at 23 °C. Both the laboratory standards took part in CCM.P-K12 and were considered as primary. The comparison measurements were performed in October 2012. CMI proved equivalence both with IMT and with the reference value of the key comparison CCM.P-K12.</p><p>Main text.
