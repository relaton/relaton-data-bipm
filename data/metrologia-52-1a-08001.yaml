abstract:
- content: "<p>The CCQM-K82 comparison was designed to evaluate the degrees of equivalence
    of NMI capabilities for methane in air primary reference mixtures in the range
    (1800 to 2200) nmol/mol. The balance gas for the standards was either scrubbed
    dry real air or synthetic air.</p><p>\nCH<sub>4</sub> in air standards have been
    produced by a number of laboratories for many years, with more recent developments
    focused on standards at atmospheric measurement concentrations and aimed at obtaining
    agreement between independently produced standards. A comparison of the differences
    in primary gas standards for methane in air was previously performed in 2003 (CCQM-P41
    Greenhouse gases. 1 and 2) with a standard deviation of results around the reference
    value of 30 nmol/mol and 10 nmol/mol for a more limited set of standards. This
    can be contrasted with the level of agreement required from field laboratories
    routinely measuring atmospheric methane levels, set by Data Quality Objectives
    (DQO) established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to reflect the
    scientifically desirable level of compatibility for CH<sub>4</sub> measurements
    at the global scale, currently set at 2 nmol/mol (1 sigma).</p><p>\nThe measurements
    of this key comparison took place from May 2012 to June 2012.</p><p>\nEight laboratories
    took part in this comparison coordinated by the BIPM and NIST. Key comparison
    reference values were calculated based on Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy Measurements
    performed at the BIPM, combined with participant's gravimetric values to identify
    a consistent set of standards. Regression analysis allowed predicted values for
    each standard to be calculated which acted as the KCRVs. In this comparison reported
    standard uncertainties by participants ranged from 0.50 nmol/mol to 2.4 nmol/mol
    and the uncertainties of individual KCRVs ranged from 0.68 nmol/mol to 0.71 nmol/mol.</p><p>\nThe
    standard deviation of the ensemble of standards about the KCRV value was 1.70
    nmol/mol. This represents a greater than tenfold improvement in the level of compatibility
    of methane in air standards compared to that demonstrated in 2003. Further improvements
    in the compatibility of standards will require improved methods and uncertainties
    for the measurement of trace level methane in balance gases.</p><p> Main text.
