    <p>In this comparison the equivalence of conductivity measurement results has been investigated in the conductivity range from ultrapure water level (5.5 μS m<sup>-1</sup>) up to 1500 μS m<sup>-1</sup>). The measurements were performed in a closed pure water loop with primary methods and with commercial devices. To this end the conductivity measurement cells of the participating institutes were integrated in series with the primary cell of PTB, which in this way linked the results. In general the primary methods of PTB and DFM are consistent within an expanded uncertainty of 0.5 %. A slight inconsistency at the ultrapure water level resulted from a small leakage during that measurement. SP, using a commercial device, measured consistent values. CMI, also using a commercial device, underestimated its measurement uncertainty.</p><p>Main text.
