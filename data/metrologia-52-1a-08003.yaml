  content: "<p>The APMP.QM-K19 was organised by TCQM of APMP to test the abilities
    of the national metrology institutes in the APMP region to measure a pH value
    of a borate buffer. This APMP comparison on pH measurement was proposed by the
    National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and the National Institute of Metrology
    (Thailand) (NIMT) at the APMP-TCQM meeting held 26–27 November 2012.  After approval
    by TCQM, the comparison has been conducted by NMIJ and NIMT.  The comparison is
    a key comparison following CCQM-K19 and CCQM-K19.1.  The comparison material was
    a borate buffer of pH around 9.2 and the measurement temperatures were 15 °C,
    25 °C and 37 °C.  This is the second APMP key comparison on pH measurement and
    the fourth APMP comparison on pH measurement following APMP.QM-P06 (two phosphate
    buffers) in 2004, APMP.QM-P09 (a phthalate buffer) in 2006 and APMP.QM-K9/APMP.QM-P16
    (a phosphate buffer) in 2010–2011. </p>\n<p>\nThe results can be used further
    by any participant to support its CMC claim at least for a borate buffer.  That
    claim will concern the pH method employed by the participant during this comparison
    and will cover the used temperature(s) or the full temperature range between 15°C
    and 37 °C for the participant which measured pH values at the three temperatures.
