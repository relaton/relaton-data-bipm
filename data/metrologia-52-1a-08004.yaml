  content: "<p>Cosmetics are used in practically all walks of life as a means of improving
    skin and beautifying complexion. In recent years, more and more attention has
    been paid to the cosmetic safety. In response to the cosmetic safety issue, the
    accurate measurement of the heavy metals in cosmetics is, therefore, particularly
    important. NMIs from different countries should establish their chemical metrology
    traceability system in this area, which includes both measurement methods research
    and certain CRMs development. It should be noted that because the matrix of many
    cosmetics is complex and the contents of the heavy metals are relatively low,
    it still is a challenging task to measure the analytes with high accuracy and
    precision. </p>\n<p>\nCCQM-K106  followed up CCQM pilot study 'CCQM-P128: Pb,
    As measurements in cosmetic (cream)' coordinated by the National Institute of
    Metrology, China (NIM) in 2009. The cream was selected as the testing material,
    which is widely used as a daily skin care worldwide. This is the first CCQM key
    comparison regarding the measurement of toxic metal elements with the cosmetic
    matrix, which includes pure water, liquid paraffin, silicone oil, synthetic squalane,
    hyaluronic acid, glycerin, propylene glycol, allantoin, preservative and so on.
    The aim of the CCQM-K106 is to demonstrate the capability of participating NMIs
    and designated institutes in measuring the contents of poisonous elements, including
    lead, arsenic and mercury in a cosmetic sample (cream), and support CMC claims
    relating to inorganic elements in cosmetic materials and similar chemical industry
    products.</p>\n<p> \nThe cream matrix sample was prepared under the guidance of
    professional technicians. The formula of the cream was carefully chosen to match
    with a real cosmetic. The homogeneity and stability level of Pb, As and Hg in
    the cream sample were fit for the objective of the comparison. Each participant
    received two numbered bottles containing about 5g samples in each bottle. The
    instruction relating to CCQM-K106 was sent to each participant by e-mail, which
    consisted of technical protocol, results report form and inorganic core capabilities
    tables. The results were reported as mass faction (mg/kg). Calculation of the
    uncertainty expressed as a combined standard uncertainty and an expanded uncertainty
    at 95% confidence. In order to allow a sufficient evaluation of the comparison,
    the report was required to include a detailed description of the applied method
    of measurement, information about sample digestion and preparation, information
    about the reference material used for calibration.</p>\n<p> \nThe methods of measurement
    were free to be selected by the participants. For the sample treatment, most of
    the participants used microwave digestion method. For instrumental determination,
    a variety of techniques such as ICP-MS, AAS, INAA were adopted by the participants.
    Most participants choose ID-ICP-MS method to measure Pb and Hg, which showed the
    better performance in terms of consistency and reliability of the measurement
    results.</p>\n<p> \nThe reference mass fraction values and associated uncertainties
    were calculated by different statistic ways. As the result, the median and uncertainty
    of median were proposed as the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and its associated
    key comparison reference uncertainty after removal of suspected extreme values.</p>\n<p>In
    general, the performances of the majority of the CCQM-K106 participants are excellent,
    illustrating their measurement capability for Pb, As and Hg in a complex greasy
    matrix. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe results can be used further by any participant to support
    its CMC claim at least for a borate buffer.  That claim will concern the pH method
    employed by the participant during this comparison and will cover the used temperature(s)
    or the full temperature range between 15°C and 37 °C for the participant which
    measured pH values at the three temperatures. \n\n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
