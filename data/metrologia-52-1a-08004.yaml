abstract:
- content: "<p>Cosmetics are used in practically all walks of life as a means of improving
    skin and beautifying complexion. In recent years, more and more attention has
    been paid to the cosmetic safety. In response to the cosmetic safety issue, the
    accurate measurement of the heavy metals in cosmetics is, therefore, particularly
    important. NMIs from different countries should establish their chemical metrology
    traceability system in this area, which includes both measurement methods research
    and certain CRMs development. It should be noted that because the matrix of many
    cosmetics is complex and the contents of the heavy metals are relatively low,
    it still is a challenging task to measure the analytes with high accuracy and
    precision.</p><p>\nCCQM-K106  followed up CCQM pilot study 'CCQM-P128: Pb, As
    measurements in cosmetic (cream)' coordinated by the National Institute of Metrology,
    China (NIM) in 2009. The cream was selected as the testing material, which is
    widely used as a daily skin care worldwide. This is the first CCQM key comparison
    regarding the measurement of toxic metal elements with the cosmetic matrix, which
    includes pure water, liquid paraffin, silicone oil, synthetic squalane, hyaluronic
    acid, glycerin, propylene glycol, allantoin, preservative and so on. The aim of
    the CCQM-K106 is to demonstrate the capability of participating NMIs and designated
    institutes in measuring the contents of poisonous elements, including lead, arsenic
    and mercury in a cosmetic sample (cream), and support CMC claims relating to inorganic
    elements in cosmetic materials and similar chemical industry products.</p><p>
    \nThe cream matrix sample was prepared under the guidance of professional technicians.
    The formula of the cream was carefully chosen to match with a real cosmetic. The
    homogeneity and stability level of Pb, As and Hg in the cream sample were fit
    for the objective of the comparison. Each participant received two numbered bottles
    containing about 5g samples in each bottle. The instruction relating to CCQM-K106
    was sent to each participant by e-mail, which consisted of technical protocol,
    results report form and inorganic core capabilities tables. The results were reported
    as mass faction (mg/kg). Calculation of the uncertainty expressed as a combined
    standard uncertainty and an expanded uncertainty at 95% confidence. In order to
    allow a sufficient evaluation of the comparison, the report was required to include
    a detailed description of the applied method of measurement, information about
    sample digestion and preparation, information about the reference material used
    for calibration.</p><p> \nThe methods of measurement were free to be selected
    by the participants. For the sample treatment, most of the participants used microwave
    digestion method. For instrumental determination, a variety of techniques such
    as ICP-MS, AAS, INAA were adopted by the participants. Most participants choose
    ID-ICP-MS method to measure Pb and Hg, which showed the better performance in
    terms of consistency and reliability of the measurement results.</p><p> \nThe
    reference mass fraction values and associated uncertainties were calculated by
    different statistic ways. As the result, the median and uncertainty of median
    were proposed as the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and its associated
    key comparison reference uncertainty after removal of suspected extreme values.</p><p>In
    general, the performances of the majority of the CCQM-K106 participants are excellent,
    illustrating their measurement capability for Pb, As and Hg in a complex greasy
    matrix.</p><p>\nThe results can be used further by any participant to support
    its CMC claim at least for a borate buffer.  That claim will concern the pH method
    employed by the participant during this comparison and will cover the used temperature(s)
    or the full temperature range between 15°C and 37 °C for the participant which
    measured pH values at the three temperatures.</p><p> Main text. \nTo reach the
    main text of this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that this text is that which
    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by CCQM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
