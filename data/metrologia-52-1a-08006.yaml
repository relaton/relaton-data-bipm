  content: "<p>The CCQM study P58.1 assessed the equivalence of immunoassay measurements
    between participating NMIs. The aim of P58.1 was to demonstrate the equivalence
    of immunoassay measurements to determine the mass concentration of the clinically-relevant
    protein human cardiac troponin I (cTnI) present at low concentration relative
    to the protein concentration of the sample matrix. The measurement equivalence
    was assessed using traceability to a common certified reference material. To quantify
    cTnI, participants used a homogeneous sandwich-based immunoassay with an enzymatic
    amplification step. The antibody format consisted of a single capture and single
    detection antibody (referred to as 1 + 1), both were supplied to study participants.
    \  \n</p>\n<p>\nIn the previous P58 study, ELISA measurement results were compared
    between laboratories which all used common ELISA reagents (including 96-well plates),
    samples, a standard for the production of calibrants, and a detailed ELISA protocol,
    which were supplied by a single laboratory.  The P58.1 study only utilized common
    samples, a standard of the production of calibrants, and a set of monoclonal antibodies
    (mAbs).  Because much of the experimental procedure for the P58 study was essentially
    standardized across participating labs, the study primarily highlighted between-laboratory
    differences in plate sampling designs and in plate reader response.  As the participants
    in the P58.1 study had to produce most of their own analytical reagents and develop
    their own measurement procedure, the study provides a better evaluation of the
    equivalence of ELISA measurements between the participating laboratories.</p>\n<p><bold>Main
