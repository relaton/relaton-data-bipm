    <p>At the Paris meeting in April 2011, the CCQM Working Group on Organic Analysis (OAWG) agreed on a suite of Track A studies meant to support the assessment of measurement capabilities needed for the delivery of measurement services within the scope of the OAWG Terms of Reference. One of the studies discussed and agreed upon for the suite of ten Track A studies that support the 5-year plan of the CCQM Core Competence assessment was CCQM-K95 'Mid-Polarity Analytes in Food Matrix: Mid-Polarity Pesticides in Tea'.</p><p>
    This key comparison was co-organized by the Government Laboratory of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (GL) and the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM). To allow wider participation, a pilot study, CCQM-P136, was run in parallel.</p><p>
    Participants' capabilities in measuring mid-polarity analytes in food matrix were demonstrated through this key comparison. Most of the participating NMIs/DIs successfully measured beta-endosulfan and endosulfan sulphate in the sample, however, there is room for further improvement for some participants.</p><p>
    This key comparison involved not only extraction, clean-up, analytical separation and selective detection of the analytes in a complex food matrix, but also the pre-treatment procedures of the material before the extraction process. The problem of incomplete extraction of the incurred analytes from the sample matrix may not be observed simply by using spike recovery.</p><p>
    The relative standard deviations for the data included in the KCRV calculation in this key comparison were less than 7 % which was acceptable given the complexity of the matrix, the level of the analytes and the complexity of the analytical procedure.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
