  content: "<p>At the Paris meeting in April 2011, the CCQM Working Group on Organic
    Analysis (OAWG) agreed on a suite of Track A studies meant to support the assessment
    of measurement capabilities needed for the delivery of measurement services within
    the scope of the OAWG Terms of Reference. One of the studies discussed and agreed
    upon for the suite of ten Track A studies that support the 5-year plan of the
    CCQM Core Competence assessment was CCQM-K95 'Mid-Polarity Analytes in Food Matrix:
    Mid-Polarity Pesticides in Tea'.   \n</p>\n<p>\nThis key comparison was co-organized
    by the Government Laboratory of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (GL) and
    the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM).  To allow wider participation,
    a pilot study, CCQM-P136, was run in parallel.</p>\n<p>\nParticipants' capabilities
    in measuring mid-polarity analytes in food matrix were demonstrated through this
    key comparison. Most of the participating NMIs/DIs successfully measured beta-endosulfan
    and endosulfan sulphate in the sample, however, there is room for further improvement
    for some participants. </p>\n<p>\nThis key comparison involved not only extraction,
    clean-up, analytical separation and selective detection of the analytes in a complex
    food matrix, but also the pre-treatment procedures of the material before the
    extraction process. The problem of incomplete extraction of the incurred analytes
    from the sample matrix may not be observed simply by using spike recovery.</p>\n<p>\nThe
    relative standard deviations for the data included in the KCRV calculation in
    this key comparison were less than 7 % which was acceptable given the complexity
    of the matrix, the level of the analytes and the complexity of the analytical
    procedure.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo reach the main text of this paper,

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by CCQM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
