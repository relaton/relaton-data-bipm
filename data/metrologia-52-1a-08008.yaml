    <p>At the SIM meeting in Buenos Aires, from 30 May 2012 to 1 June 2012, it was decided to perform a RMO Key Comparison and a Pilot Study to evaluate the performance of SIM national metrology institutes for measuring electrolytic conductivity. The Brazilian Institute of Metrology, INMETRO, agreed to act as coordinating laboratory.</p><p>
    The proposed RMO Key Comparison aims to investigate the equivalence of electrolytic conductivity measurement results around 0.05 S m<sup>-1</sup> at 25<sup>°</sup>C.</p><p>
    Four institutes took part in the comparison. There was a good agreement of the reported results with the average value, considering the measurement uncertainties.</p><p>Main text.

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
