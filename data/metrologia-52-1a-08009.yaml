  content: "<p>This bilateral comparison, which is traceable to CCQM-K53, was carried
    out to support NIM's capability for the preparation of stable gas species in nitrogen.
    The target amount of substance was 100 μmol/mol of oxygen in nitrogen, which was
    prepared gravimetrically by the participant. The comparison showed that the NIM
    and KRISS gravimetric values were consistent with each other to within the expanded
    uncertainty of 0.200 μmol/mol. Therefore the comparison is well linked to the
    CCQM-K53 and offers a gravimetric preparation capability of oxygen in nitrogen
    at a level of 100 μmol/mol to the participant. \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main text.</bold>\nTo
