abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>A torque key comparison coded CCM.T-K1.3 was conducted at the torques of 0 N m, 500 N m and 1000 N m as an extension of the key comparison CCM.T-K1 between two laboratories, Korea Research Institute of Science and Standards (KRISS) and National Institute of Standard (NIS) in Egypt. KRISS, who joined CCM.T-K1 key comparison in 2005, piloted this comparison and played a role of a link laboratory. Comparison results show that NIS torques at 0 N m, 500 N m, and 1000 N m are equivalent to KCRVs of CCM.T-K1.</p><p>Main text.
