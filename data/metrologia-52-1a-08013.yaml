  content: "<p>Methane is one of the major greenhouse gases that affect climate change.
    To mitigate anthropogenic CH4 emissions effectively, it is necessary to measure
    and monitor CH4 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Therefore, it is important
    for NMIs to have the capability of an accurate CH4 emissions measurement. \nThe
    first key comparison on methane in nitrogen or air is the key comparison of CCQM-K82
    (ambient level methane in air). As a supplementary comparison, the purpose of
    this comparison is to cover a concentration level that is not covered by previous
    key comparisons: this report describes the results of a supplementary comparison
    for methane in nitrogen at 2000 μmol/mol. Results from all participants, except
    two, agree well within their associated uncertainties.  \n  \n</p>\n<p><bold>Main
