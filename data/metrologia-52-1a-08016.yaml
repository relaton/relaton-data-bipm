    <p>The CCQM-K96.1 key comparison was a subsequent bilateral comparison to the CCQM-K96 'Determination of amount content of dichromate'. The comparisons were organized jointly by the inorganic analysis and electrochemical analysis working groups of the CCQM to test the abilities of the metrology institutes to measure the content amount of dichromate. The NIM China has obtained unsatisfactory results from the CCQM-K96. The NIM requested a bilateral comparison to demonstrate its capability after improvement. The KRISS acted as the coordinating laboratory and served as a link to the reference value of CCQM-K96. Both participants used high-accuracy constant current coulometry. A good agreement of the results was observed.
