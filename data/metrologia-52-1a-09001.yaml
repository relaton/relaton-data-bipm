    <p>A description is given of COOMET.AUV.W-S1 supplementary comparison of free-field hydrophone calibrations in the frequency range 250 Hz to 8 kHz between Hangzhou Applied Acoustics Research Instituteâ€”a pilot and Russian National Research Institute for Physicotechnical and Radio Engineering Measurements. Two standard hydrophones of TC 4033 and GI 55 were calibrated in this comparison. Reciprocity method, comparison methods, and their facilities were used to assess the current state of free-field hydrophone calibration in the frequency range 250 Hz to 8 kHz of China and Russia. The consistency of calibration results between two participants was confirmed, and the maximum deviation observed was 0.59 dB at frequency 400 Hz.</p>
