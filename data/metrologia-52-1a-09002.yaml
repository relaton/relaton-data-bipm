    <p>This is the final report for pilot comparison APMP.AUV.V-P1 in the area of low-intensity 'shock', which in this case means monopole and dipole shock acceleration. The aim of this comparison was to measure the shock voltage sensitivity of one Accelerometer Chain with primary means under monopole shock excitation in the acceleration range from 500 m/s<sup>2</sup> to 5 000 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and under dipole shock excitation with the reference acceleration of 1000 m/s<sup>2</sup> and pulse duration from 0.03 ms to 2.0 ms. Four laboratories with primary shock calibration capability have participated in the comparison with National Institute of Metrology, P R  China as pilot lab. One standard accelerometer of back-to-back type with a charge amplifier (Accelerometer Chain) was circulated among the participants. The pilot comparison reference values have been calculated using the weighted mean value of the results. The degrees of equivalence calculated from the data submitted by the four laboratories, support the uncertainty of measurement reported by them for the calibration of the shock sensitivities of accelerometer. At the reference acceleration of 1 000 m/s<sup>2</sup> and pulse duration of 2 ms (specified in ISO 16063-13:2001), the participating laboratories calibrated the Accelerometer Chain with their claimed relative expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic> = 2), the smallest of which equal to 0.5%, i.e. smaller than the limit specified by the ISO standard. The completion of APMP.AUV.V-P1 can serve as part of the basis for a planned key comparison targeted at low intensity shock range at CC level.</p>
