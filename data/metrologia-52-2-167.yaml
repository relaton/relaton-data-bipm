abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The total luminous flux of a light source is the complete integration
    of its spectral radiance distribution weighted with the photopic observer and
    taken over all parts of its surface and over the full solid angle of emittance.
    The spatial distributions are measured with various types of goniophotometers
    and the PTB robot goniophotometer is a new type with many unique features. It
    is built as an arrangement of three robots with arms of more than 6 m in length
    and with 7 degrees of freedom each. The extreme flexibility of the robots allows
    computer controlled tracks with variable radii and speeds up to 3 m and 1 m s<sup>−1</sup>,
    respectively. One robot aligns the light source and the two other robots move
    photometers and array spectrometers in their hemispheres simultaneously measuring
    planar illuminance and the related relative spectral distribution. The robot goniophotometer
    is optimized for the realisation of the luminous flux unit, the lumen and it is
    completely characterized in this report. The relevant properties and correction
    factors are explained, as well as the implementation of techniques for synchronisation
    and stabilisation of spatially resolved or integrated photometric and colorimetric
    quantities. Finally, all contributions are combined in the model of evaluation
    for the (total) luminous flux value and the measurement uncertainty associated
    with that value is evaluated in the presented uncertainty budget. The goniophotometric
    determination of the values for colorimetric quantities is explained for the total
    luminous flux and the spatially distributed radiant power.</p>
