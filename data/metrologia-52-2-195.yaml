abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We performed a precision measurement of the current from a single-parameter
    electron pump, where the potential-profile for a quantum dot was manipulated by
    multiple top-metal gates. In an optimally tuned condition, driven with a sinusoidal-waveform
    microwave at f = 0.95 GHz, B = 11 T, and T = 0.3 K, the relative deviation of
    the pump current from ef, δI<sub>p</sub>/ef ≡ (I<sub>p</sub> − ef)/ef was measured
    to be (−0.92  ±  1.37) ppm. Our experiment reproduces the current quantisation
    accuracy of a previous measurement of a single-parameter pump, but in a device
    fabricated using very different geometry, thereby indicating that accurate single-parameter
    pumping is insensitive to device details.</p>
