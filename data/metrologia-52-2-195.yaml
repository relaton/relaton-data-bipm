    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We performed a precision measurement of the current from a single-parameter electron pump, where the potential-profile for a quantum dot was manipulated by multiple top-metal gates. In an optimally tuned condition, driven with a sinusoidal-waveform microwave at <italic>f</italic> = 0.95 GHz, <italic>B</italic> = 11 T, and <italic>T</italic> = 0.3 K, the relative deviation of the pump current from <italic>ef</italic>, <italic>δI</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>/<italic>ef</italic> ≡ (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> − <italic>ef</italic>)/<italic>ef</italic> was measured to be (−0.92  ±  1.37) ppm. Our experiment reproduces the current quantisation accuracy of a previous measurement of a single-parameter pump, but in a device fabricated using very different geometry, thereby indicating that accurate single-parameter pumping is insensitive to device details.</p>
