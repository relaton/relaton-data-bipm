abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Photogrametric systems are widely used in the field of industrial
    metrology to measure kinematic tasks such as tracking robot movements. In order
    to assess spatiotemporal deviations of a kinematic movement, it is crucial to
    have a reliable uncertainty of the kinematic measurements. Common methods to evaluate
    the uncertainty in kinematic measurements include approximations specified by
    the manufactures, various analytical adjustment methods and Kalman filters.</p><p>Here
    a hybrid system estimator in conjunction with a kinematic measurement model is
    applied. This method can be applied to processes which include various types of
    kinematic behaviour, constant velocity, variable acceleration or variable turn
    rates. Additionally, it has been shown that the approach is in accordance with
    GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement). The approach is compared
    to the Kalman filter using simulated data to achieve an overall error calculation.
    Furthermore, the new approach is used for the analysis of a rotating system as
    this system has both a constant and a variable turn rate.</p><p>As the new approach
    reduces overshoots it is more appropriate for analysing kinematic processes than
    the Kalman filter. In comparison with the manufacturerâ€™s approximations, the new
    approach takes account of kinematic behaviour, with an improved description of
    the real measurement process. Therefore, this approach is well-suited to the analysis
    of kinematic processes with unknown changes in kinematic behaviour.</p>
