abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The measurement of the Avogadro constant by counting Si atoms
    is based on the assumption that Si balls of about 94Â mm diameter have a perfect
    crystal structure up to the outermost atom layers. This is not the case because
    of the surface relaxation and reconstruction, the possible presence of an amorphous
    layer, and the oxidation process due to the interaction with the ambient. This
    paper gives the results of density functional calculations of the strain components
    orthogonal to crystal surface in a number of configurations likely found in real
    samples.</p>
