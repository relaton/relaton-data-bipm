abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe a simple method for high-precision rotary angle
    encoder calibration for long-range angular errors. By using a redesigned electronic
    nulling autocollimator, an optical-polygon artifact is calibrated simultaneously
    with determining the encoder error function over a rotation of 2π rad. The technique
    is applied to the NIST vacuum double crystal spectrometer, which depends on precise
    measurement of diffraction angles to determine absolute x-ray wavelengths. By
    oversampling, the method returned the encoder error function with an expanded
    uncertainty (k = 2) of 0.004 s of plane angle. Knowledge of the error function
    permits the instrument to make individual encoder readings with an accuracy of
    0.06 s (k = 2), which is limited primarily by the least count and noise of the
    encoder electronics. While the error function lay within the nominal specifications,
    it differed from the intrinsic factory curve, indicating the need for in situ
    calibration in high-precision applications.</p>
