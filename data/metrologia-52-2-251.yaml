abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For decades the global positioning system (GPS) has been the
    only space geodetic technique routinely used for inter-continental frequency transfer
    applications. In the past very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) has also been
    considered for this purpose and the method’s capabilities were studied several
    times. However, compared to GPS current VLBI technology only provides few observations
    per hour, thus limiting its potential to improve frequency comparisons. We therefore
    investigate the effect of combining GPS and VLBI on the observation level in order
    to draw the maximum benefit from the strength of each individual technique. As
    a test-bed for our study we use the CONT11 campaign observed in 2011. First we
    review the frequency transfer performance that can be achieved with independent
    technique-specific analyses, both with individual software packages and with the
    multi-technique software c5++. With this analysis approach both techniques, GPS
    and VLBI, show similar frequency link instabilities at the level of 10<sup>−14</sup>
    to 10<sup>−15</sup> (MDEV) on inter-continental baselines for averaging times
    of one day. Then we use the c5++ software for a combined analysis of GPS and VLBI
    data on the observation level. We demonstrate that our combination approach leads
    to small but consistent improvements for frequency transfer of up to 10%, in particular
    for averaging periods longer than 3000 s.</p>
