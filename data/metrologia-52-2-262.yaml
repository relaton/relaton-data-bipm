abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Several digital pressure gauges at the National Metrology Institute
    of Japan (NMIJ) have been calibrated in the barometric pressure range on a regular
    basis for over ten years. The long-term stability of the zero and span readings
    for these pressure gauges was evaluated using their historical calibration data.
    The evaluation showed that most of the gauges have quite good long-term stabilities
    for the span readings, but some have large zero drifts with rates of about (10
    to 50) Pa yr<sup>−1</sup>. This paper discusses the causes for this drift: it
    can be explained by the combination of a small leak and gas emissions from the
    sensor volume, which are estimated from the typical drift rates. The zero drift
    of a particular gauge is well-approximated by an exponential function of time;
    the fitting function may give a good estimation of the zero drift in the future.
    This indicates that continuous characterization of a pressure gauge may enable
    appropriate correction of the indication and provide users more reliable data
    with less calibration work.</p>'
