abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When comparing absorbed dose standards from different laboratories
    (e.g. National Measurement Institutes, NMIs, for Key or Supplementary comparisons)
    it is rarely possible to carry out a direct comparison of primary standard instruments,
    and therefore some form of transfer detector is required. Historically, air-filled,
    unsealed ionization chambers have been used because of the long history of using
    these instruments, very good stability over many years, and ease of transport.
    However, the use of ion chambers for therapy-level comparisons is not without
    its problems. Findings from recent investigations suggest that ion chambers are
    prone to non-random variations, they are not completely robust to standard courier
    practices, and failure at any step in a comparison can render all measurements
    potentially useless.</p><p>An alternative approach is to identify a transfer system
    that is insensitive to some of these concerns—effectively a dosimeter that is
    inexpensive, simple to use, robust, but with sufficient precision and of a size
    relevant to the disseminated quantity in question. The alanine dosimetry system
    has been successfully used in a number of situations as an audit dosimeter and
    therefore the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether alanine could
    also be used as the transfer detector for dosimetric comparisons, which require
    a lower value for the measurement uncertainty.</p><p>A measurement protocol was
    developed for comparing primary standards of absorbed dose to water in high-energy
    electron beams using alanine pellets irradiated in a water-equivalent plastic
    phantom. A trial comparison has been carried out between three NMIs and has indicated
    that alanine is a suitable alternative to ion chambers, with the system used achieving
    a precision of 0.1%. Although the focus of the evaluation was on the performance
    of the dosimeter, the comparison results are encouraging, showing agreement at
    the level of the combined uncertainties (~0.6%). Based on this investigation,
    a large-scale comparison of primary standards for high-energy electron beams is
    currently being developed under the auspices of the BIPM.</p>
