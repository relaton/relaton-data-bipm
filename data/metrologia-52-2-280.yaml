abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The former University of Washington Penning Trap Mass Spectrometer
    (UW-PTMS), now located at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg,
    Germany, was used in the decade before the move to determine new values for the
    deuteron atomic mass, M (<sup>2</sup>H<sup>+</sup>) = 2.013 553 212 745(40) u,
    and the deuterium atomic mass, M (<sup>2</sup>H) = 2.014 101 778 052(40) u, both
    of which are now more than an order-of-magnitude more accurate than the previous
    best 1994-MIT measurements of these quantities. The new value for the deuteron’s
    mass can then be used with the accepted 2010-CODATA proton mass and the most recent
    1999-measurement of the 2.2 MeV gamma-ray binding energy of the deuteron to refine
    the neutron’s mass to m<sub>n</sub> = 1.008 664 916 018(435) u which has about
    half the uncertainty relative to the value computed using that previous 1994-MIT
    deuterium measurement. As a result, further improvements of m<sub>n</sub> must
    now come from a more accurate determination of the wavelength of this gamma ray.</p><p>In
    this same period of time, this spectrometer has also been used to determine new
    values for the helion atomic mass, M (<sup>3</sup>He<sup>2+</sup>) = 3.014 932 246 668(43) u,
    and the neutral helium-3 atomic mass, M (<sup>3</sup>He) = 3.016 029 321 675(43) u,
    which are both about 60 times more accurate than the 2006-SMILETRAP measurements,
    but disagree with the 4.4-times less-accurate 2015-Florida-State measurements
    by 0.76 nu. It is expected that these helium-3 results will be used in the future<sup>3</sup>H/<sup>3</sup>He
    mass ratio (to be determined by the Heidelberg, Germany version of the old UW-PTMS)
    in order to generate a more accurate value for the tritium atomic mass.</p>
