    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The term ‘dimension’ as used in the <italic>International System of Units</italic> (SI) is not well defined. Moreover, the term ‘quantity of dimension one’ (formerly called ‘dimensionless quantity’, a term which is unfortunately still sometimes used) as defined in the <italic>International Vocabulary of Metrology</italic> (VIM) is mathematically unsound. In order to overcome these difficulties, a new quantity dimension, called ‘dimension number’, will be introduced in this paper. It will be shown that such a dimension necessarily belongs to any <italic>system of dimensions</italic>, but is <italic>not</italic> a base dimension.</p>
