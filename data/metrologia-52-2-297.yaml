abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The term ‘dimension’ as used in the International System of
    Units (SI) is not well defined. Moreover, the term ‘quantity of dimension one’
    (formerly called ‘dimensionless quantity’, a term which is unfortunately still
    sometimes used) as defined in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM)
    is mathematically unsound. In order to overcome these difficulties, a new quantity
    dimension, called ‘dimension number’, will be introduced in this paper. It will
    be shown that such a dimension necessarily belongs to any system of dimensions,
    but is not a base dimension.</p>
