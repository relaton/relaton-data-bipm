abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For many years, the time community has been using the precise
    point positioning (PPP) technique which uses GPS phase and code observations to
    compute time and frequency links. However, progress in atomic clocks implies that
    the performance of PPP frequency comparisons is a limiting factor in comparing
    the best frequency standards. We show that a PPP technique where the integer nature
    of phase ambiguities is preserved consitutes significant improvement of the classical
    use of floating ambiguities. We demonstrate that this integer-PPP technique allows
    frequency comparisons with 1  ×  10<sup>−16</sup> accuracy in a few days and can
    be readily operated with existing products.</p>
