abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Sparkle is a non-uniform texture effect consisting of very bright
    spots distributed on a dark surround. To date the only commercially-available
    instrument able to quantify sparkle is BYK-mac. This instrument allows sparkle
    parameters to be obtained, which should correlate with the visual experience.
    However, the measurands corresponding to these parameters are not clearly defined
    and they cannot be measured by any other instruments. In this article, we describe
    a procedure to measure quantities of well-defined sparkle measurands. We present
    experimental results at a combination of well-distributed illumination/viewing
    geometries within the incident plane. From this study, four descriptors are derived
    which may be correlated with visual attributes of sparkle. Finally, the procedure
    to estimate the perceived sparkle at any given surround luminance from the measured
    sparkle quantities is explained.</p>
