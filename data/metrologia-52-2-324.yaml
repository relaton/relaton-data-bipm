abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the past few years, the perturbation due to the finite speed
    of light was among the most inconsistent in corner-cube absolute gravimeters.
    For the relativistic treatment of the perturbation based on Lorentz transformation,
    the relation between Doppler shift in special relativity and time delay in classical
    domain is easily misunderstood, leading to spurious conclusions. To avoid these
    issues, we apply a ‘relativistic geometrical method’ based on the motion of photons
    to calculate the frequency shift in corner-cube absolute gravimeters, where the
    misunderstood relation has been corrected. Additionally, we find that the modern
    corner-cube absolute gravimeters cannot sense effects of the special relativity.</p>
