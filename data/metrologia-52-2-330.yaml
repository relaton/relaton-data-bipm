abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The temperature of the Si–SiC eutectic fixed point for use
    in thermocouple thermometry has been determined. Three Si–SiC cells were fabricated
    from pure silicon powder within separate graphite crucibles. Each of the three
    cells was cycled through 17 melt–freeze cycles and subjected to temperatures above
    1400 °C for a period of approximately 73 h, and none showed any sign of mechanical
    failure. The melting transition was measured using three types of thermocouple:
    one type S, one type B, and two Pt/Pd thermocouples calibrated at the fixed points
    of Ag, Cu, Fe–C, Co–C, and Pd (only for type B). The transition temperature, measured
    using the type S and two Pt/Pd thermocouples, was (1410.0 ± 0.8) °C with k = 2.
    However, the measurement uncertainty using the type B thermocouple was as large
    as 1.5 °C (k = 2) due to the inhomogeneity of the thermocouple. The repeatability
    of the three Si–SiC cells was calculated to be 0.3 °C, and the extremes of the
    temperature measurement differed by 0.8 °C.</p>'
