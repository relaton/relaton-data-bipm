abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>High temperature fixed points (HTFPs) are stable and repeatable
    and make comparison of temperature scales possible at a level of uncertainty not
    previously possible. However, they potentially lack objectivity if the fixed-point
    temperature is known. Five HTFPs were constructed, one pure Co–C, two Co–C doped
    with Fe and two Co–C doped with Pt of differing concentrations. The candidate
    dopants were identified through thermochemical modelling as likely to give maximum
    temperature shift with minimum increase in melting range. The temperature differences
    of the doped systems from the pure system were determined and it was found that
    the addition of Fe depressed the melting temperature and the addition of Pt elevated
    the melting temperature, qualitatively in line with the thermochemical modelling.
    The higher concentration doped HTFPs were then aged for approximately 100 h with
    continuous melting–freezing cycles and the difference to the undoped Co–C HTFP
    remeasured. These differences were found to agree with those of the unaged results
    within the measurement uncertainties, confirming artefact stability. It is clear
    that the doping of HTFPs is a powerful way of constructing stable and reliable
    high temperature scale comparison artefacts of unknown temperature.</p>
