abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In Poland, an accurate two-way optical fibre time transfer (TWOTT)
    baseline of 420 km has been developed with a standard uncertainty of 112 ps. Meanwhile,
    the BIPM has been engaged in a pilot project to reduce the uncertainty of UTC
    GNSS time transfer calibrations from 5 ns to approximately 1.5 ns, for which it
    has developed a standard calibration scheme, named METODE, associated with an
    integrated portable GNSS calibration station. The TWOTT and the METODE respectively
    represent the world’s most advanced time transfer method and calibration facility.</p><p>In
    July 2013, the BIPM calibrator and the TWOTT self-calibrated optical fibre transceivers
    were set up side by side to compare their results. This is the first time that
    an operational TWOTT has been used in accurate time transfer and the first time
    that a GNSS calibration method has been validated with a technique accurate to
    200 ps. As the two systems are completely independent and the latter is one order
    of magnitude more accurate than the first, this comparison allowed validation
    of the METODE and its uncertainty. It also confirmed that any bias in the TWOTT
    is at most 1 ns.</p>
