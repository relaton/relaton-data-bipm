abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A turbine flow meter indicates the volume of fluid flowing through
    the device per unit of time. Such a flow meter is commonly calibrated at a few
    known flow rates over its measurement range. A calibration curve relating the
    pulse factor of the meter to the flow rate is then fitted to calibration data
    using an ordinary least squares approach. This approach does not consider prior
    knowledge that may exist about the flow meter or the calibration procedure. A
    Bayesian analysis enables prior knowledge to be taken into account. A Bayesian
    inference results in a posterior distribution for the unknown parameters of the
    calibration curve that may be seen as the most comprehensive uncertainty information
    about these unknowns. This paper investigates for a flow meter calibration problem
    the effects of appreciating prior knowledge on values of the calibration curve
    and their associated uncertainties. It presents the results of a Bayesian analysis
    and compares them to those obtained by an ordinary least squares approach.</p>
