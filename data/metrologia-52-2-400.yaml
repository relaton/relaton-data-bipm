abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The degrees of equivalence are the main outcome in the analysis
    of key comparison data, and they are used for the approval of the calibration
    and measurement capabilities of the participating laboratories. Typically, the
    calibration and measurement capability of a participating laboratory is seen as
    being approved when the corresponding unilateral degree of equivalence does not
    differ significantly from zero.</p><p>The relevance of degrees of equivalence
    may deteriorate in the presence of an instability of the common measurand. In
    order to quantitatively assess this deterioration we propose to consider the loss
    of power of a hypothesis test that can be associated with checking whether a degree
    of equivalence differs significantly from zero. Based on the resulting loss of
    power, one can decide whether the size of the instability of the common measurand
    may be tolerated. We illustrate the concept in terms of results obtained for the
    recent key comparison CCM.FF-K6.2011.</p>
