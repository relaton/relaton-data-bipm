abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The acoustic nonlinearity parameter, B/A, is an important parameter
    which defines the way a propagating finite amplitude acoustic wave progressively
    distorts when travelling through any medium. One measurement technique used to
    determine its value is the finite amplitude insertion substitution (FAIS) method
    which has been applied to a range of liquid, tissue and tissue-like media. Importantly,
    in terms of the achievable measurement uncertainties, it is a relative technique.
    This paper presents a detailed study of the method, employing a number of novel
    features. The first of these is the use of a large area membrane hydrophone (30 mm
    aperture) which is used to record the plane-wave component of the acoustic field.
    This reduces the influence of diffraction on measurements, enabling studies to
    be carried out within the transducer near-field, with the interrogating transducer,
    test cell and detector positioned close to one another, an attribute which assists
    in controlling errors arising from nonlinear distortion in any intervening water
    path. The second feature is the development of a model which estimates the influence
    of finite-amplitude distortion as the acoustic wave travels from the rear surface
    of the test cell to the detector. It is demonstrated that this can lead to a significant
    systematic error in B/A measurement whose magnitude and direction depends on the
    acoustic property contrast between the test material and the water-filled equivalent
    cell. Good qualitative agreement between the model and experiment is reported.
    B/A measurements are reported undertaken at (20 ± 0.5) °C for two fluids commonly
    employed as reference materials within the technical literature: Corn Oil and
    Ethylene Glycol. Samples of an IEC standardised agar-based tissue-mimicking material
    were also measured. A systematic assessment of measurement uncertainties is presented
    giving expanded uncertainties in the range ±7% to ±14%, expressed at a confidence
    level close to 95%, dependent on specimen details.</p>'
