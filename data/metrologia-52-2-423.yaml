- content: Abstract<p>The Time Transfer by Laser Experiment (T2L2) on the Jason 2
    satellite is a mission allowing remote clocks synchronization at the picosecond
    level. It is based on laser ranging technologies, with a laser station network
    on the ground and a dedicated instrument on board the satellite. It was launched
    in June 2008 and has been working continuously since then. T2L2 performances are
    very promising for time and frequency metrology and also for fundamental physics.
    The scientific objectives of the whole experiment rely on a rigorous uncertainty
    budget. This is governed by the characteristics of the space instrument and the
    laser stations network, the post treatment done on the ground, and also the process
    used to calibrate the laser stations. The uncertainty budget demonstrates that
    T2L2 is able to perform common-view time transfers between remote sites with an
    expanded uncertainty better than 140â€‰ps (coverage factor = 2).</p>
