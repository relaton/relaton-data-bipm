abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Evaluating the residual risk of human errors in a measurement
    and testing laboratory, remaining after the error reduction by the laboratory
    quality system, and quantifying the consequences of this risk for the quality
    of the measurement/test results are discussed based on expert judgments and Monte
    Carlo simulations. A procedure for evaluation of the contribution of the residual
    risk to the measurement uncertainty budget is proposed. Examples are provided
    using earlier published sets of expert judgments on human errors in pH measurement
    of groundwater, elemental analysis of geological samples by inductively coupled
    plasma mass spectrometry, and multi-residue analysis of pesticides in fruits and
    vegetables. The human error contribution to the measurement uncertainty budget
    in the examples was not negligible, yet also not dominant. This was assessed as
    a good risk management result.</p>
