abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To categorise thermocouples in batches, manufacturers state
    an expected operating tolerance for when the thermocouples are as-new. In use,
    thermocouple behaviour can rapidly change and the tolerance becomes invalid, especially
    when used at high temperatures (i.e. above 1000 °C) as the processes leading to
    de-calibration, such as oxidation and contamination, can be very fast and lead
    to erroneous readings. In-situ thermocouple self-validation provides a method
    to track the drift and correct the thermocouple reading in real-time, but it must
    be shown to be reliable. Two miniature temperature fixed-point cells designed
    at NPL for in-situ thermocouple self-validation, the first containing a Pt-C eutectic
    alloy and the second containing a Ru-C eutectic alloy, have been exposed to temperatures
    close to their melting point for 2200 h and 1570 h, respectively, and continuously,
    for up to three months. Recalibration after this long-term high-temperature exposure,
    where a tantalum-sheathed thermocouple was always in place, is used to show that
    no significant change of the temperature reference point (the melting temperature)
    has occurred in either the Pt-C ingot or the Ru-C ingot, over timescales far longer
    than previously demonstrated and approaching that required by industry for practical
    use of the device.</p>
