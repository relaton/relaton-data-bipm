abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Blood pressure is one of the most important vital signs used
    to monitor a patientâ€™s medical condition and is widely measured in hospitals and
    at home. Automatic, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring devices measure
    systolic and diastolic blood pressures from the analysis of cuff pressure oscillations
    caused by periodic variations of blood pressure in an artery. Currently, clinical
    validation by comparing them to the auscultatory reference has been used to verify
    the performance of NIBP devices. However, there are presently no calibration methods
    for NIBP devices. Here, we propose an SI-traceable calibration method for oscillometric
    NIBP devices. The calibration system generates pressure-pulses at pre-determined
    cuff pressures, and with pre-determined amplitude, to the device-under-test. The
    uncertainty of each pulse is analyzed and used for the calculation of blood pressure
    (BP) uncertainty. The maximum uncertainty for systolic and diastolic BP using
    the newly developed calibration system is (0.74 and 0.60) mmHg ( k  = 2) depending
    on the pressure and amplitude of each pulse, as well as the number of pulses applied.
    The present method can be used for calibration of oscillometric NIBP devices.</p>
