abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>With calibrations of large flow meters in mind, we established
    the feasibility of determining the mass M of argon gas contained within a 0.3 m<sup>3</sup>
    commercially manufactured pressure vessel (‘tank’) with a relative standard uncertainty
    of u<sub>r</sub>(M) = 0.0016 at 0.6 MPa by combining the measured argon pressure
    and the measured microwave and acoustic resonance frequencies within the pressure
    vessel with an accurate equation of state for argon. (All stated uncertainties
    correspond to the 68% confidence level.) Previously, we used microwaves to determine
    the tank’s internal volume V<sub>micro</sub> with u<sub>r</sub>(V) = 0.0006 and
    to determine the thermal expansion of the volume (Moldover et al 2015 Meas. Sci.
    Tech. 26 015304). Here, we show that the microwave results accurately predict
    the wavenumbers k<sub>calc</sub> of the four lowest-frequency acoustic modes of
    the gas. When we compared k<sub>calc</sub> to the measured wavenumbers k<sub>meas</sub>,
    which included corrections for known perturbations, such as the tank’s calculated
    pressure-dependent center-of-mass motion (but not the tank’s vibrational modes),
    the inconsistency of the ratio k<sub>meas</sub>/k<sub>calc</sub> among the modes
    was the largest component of u<sub>r</sub>(M). Because the resonance frequencies
    f <sub>calc</sub> of the acoustic modes depend on the average speed of sound (and
    therefore the average temperature) of the gas in the tank, first-order perturbation
    theory predicts that f <sub>calc</sub> for a rigid cylindrical cavity is independent
    of linear temperature gradients. Consistent with this prediction, the average
    of f <sub>meas</sub> for the 3 lowest-frequency, non-degenerate longitudinal modes
    changed only Δf<sub>meas</sub> / f <sub>meas</sub> = (0.2 ± 1.3) × 10<sup>−4</sup>
    when, near ambient temperature, we heated the tank’s top 13 K warmer than its
    bottom. However, we observed a linear dependence on ΔT for the average of f <sub>meas</sub>
    for the nearly-degenerate doublet modes, which the rigid cylinder theory does
    not predict. We argue that the linear dependence on ΔT was caused by anisotropic
    changes in the tank’s shape in response to the applied temperature gradient. We
    conclude that resonance frequencies can be used to ‘weigh’ the compressed gas
    in much larger tanks, which are possibly made from ferromagnetic steel and possibly
    at high pressures in un-thermostatted environments; therefore, resonance measurements
    will have many applications in gas metrology.</p>
