abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    have been using a watt balance, NIST-3, to measure the Planck constant h for over
    ten years. Two recently published values disagree by more than one standard uncertainty.
    The motivation for the present short communication is twofold. First, we correct
    the latest published number to take into account a recently discovered systematic
    error in mass dissemination at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.
    Second, we provide guidance on how to combine the two numbers into one final result.
    In order to adequately reflect the discrepancy, we added an additional systematic
    uncertainty to the published uncertainty budgets. The final value of h measured
    with NIST-3 is h = 6.626 069 36(37) × 10<sup>−34</sup> J s. This result is 77(57) × 10<sup>−9</sup>
    fractionally higher than h<sub>90</sub>. Each number in parentheses gives the
    value of the standard uncertainty in the last two digits of the respective value
    and h<sub>90</sub> is the conventional value of the Planck constant given by h90&#x2261;4/(KJ-902RK-90)
    >, where K<sub>J-90</sub> and R<sub>K-90</sub> denote the conventional values
    of the Josephson and von Klitzing constants, respectively.</p>
