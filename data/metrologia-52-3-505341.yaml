abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Alpha-particle spectrometry is routinely performed with the
    aim of measuring absolute activities, activity ratios between different alpha-emitting
    nuclides or decay data such as branching factors, alpha emission probabilities
    and relative half-lives. It is most commonly performed with ion-implanted silicon
    detectors. Strong features of the technique are the low background levels that
    can be achieved due to low sensitivity to other types of radiation, the intrinsic
    efficiency close to 1 which reduces the efficiency calculations to a geometrical
    problem and the uniqueness of the energy spectra for each  α -decaying nuclide.
    The main challenge is the limitation to the attainable energy resolution, even
    with thin and homogenous sources, which causes alpha energy peaks to be partially
    unresolved due to their width and low-energy tailing. The spectral deconvolution
    often requires fitting of analytical functions to each peak in the alpha spectrum.
    True coincidence effects between alpha particles and subsequently emitted conversion
    electrons cause distortions of the alpha spectra which lead to significant changes
    in the apparent peak area ratios. Optimum energy resolution can only be achieved
    on very thin sources, which puts constraints on the source preparation techniques.
    Radiochemical separations may be needed to extract the alpha emitters from voluminous
    matrices and efficiency tracing is performed by adding in another isotope by known
    amounts. Typical uncertainty components are discussed by means of some hypothetical
    examples.</p>
