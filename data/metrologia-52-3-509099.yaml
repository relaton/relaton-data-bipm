abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Liquid scintillation counting is a very powerful technique for
    the activity determination of a number of radionuclides. In radionuclide metrology,
    the TDCR method and the CIEMAT/NIST efficiency tracing technique are widely used
    in many laboratories.</p><p>Both methods require rather complex calculation techniques
    to derive the counting efficiency of the nuclide under study.</p><p>This article
    explores the various sources of uncertainty that should be considered when applying
    these two techniques, and focuses on possible ways to evaluate them. Concrete
    examples are provided within the paper.</p>
