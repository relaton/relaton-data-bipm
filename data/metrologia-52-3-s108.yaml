abstract:
- content: Summary<p>Pressurized re-entrant (or 4π) ionization chambers (ICs) connected
    to current-measuring electronics are used for activity measurements of photon
    emitting radionuclides and some beta emitters in the fields of metrology and nuclear
    medicine. As a secondary method, these instruments need to be calibrated with
    appropriate activity standards from primary or direct standardization. The use
    of these instruments over 50 years has been well described in numerous publications,
    such as the Monographie BIPM-4 and the special issue of Metrologia on radionuclide
    metrology (Ratel 2007 Metrologia 44 S7–16, Schrader1997 Activity Measurements
    With Ionization Chambers (Monographie BIPM-4) Schrader 2007 Metrologia 44 S53–66,
    Cox et al 2007 Measurement Modelling of the International Reference System (SIR)
    for Gamma-Emitting Radionuclides (Monographie BIPM-7)). The present work describes
    the principles of activity measurements, calibrations, and impurity corrections
    using pressurized ionization chambers in the first part and the uncertainty analysis
    illustrated with example uncertainty budgets from routine source-calibration as
    well as from an international reference system (SIR) measurement in the second
    part.</p>
