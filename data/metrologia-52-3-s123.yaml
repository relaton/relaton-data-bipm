abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>High resolution gamma-ray spectrometry is a well-established
    metrological technique that can be applied to a large number of photon-emitting
    radionuclides, activity levels and sample shapes and compositions. Three kinds
    of quantitative information can be derived using this technique: detection efficiency
    calibration, radionuclide activity and photon emission intensities. In contrast
    to other radionuclide measurement techniques gamma-ray spectrometry provides unambiguous
    identification of gamma-ray emitting radionuclides in addition to activity values.
    This extra information comes at a cost of increased complexity and inherently
    higher uncertainties when compared with other secondary techniques. The relative
    combined standard uncertainty associated with any result obtained by gamma-ray
    spectrometry depends not only on the uncertainties of the main input parameters
    but also on different correction factors. To reduce the uncertainties, the experimental
    conditions must be optimized in terms of the signal processing electronics and
    the physical parameters of the measured sample should be accurately characterized.
    Measurement results and detailed examination of the associated uncertainties are
    presented with a specific focus on the efficiency calibration, peak area determination
    and correction factors. It must be noted that some of the input values used in
    quantitative analysis calculation can be correlated, which should be taken into
    account in fitting procedures or calculation of the uncertainties associated with
    quantitative results. It is shown that relative combined standard uncertainties
    are rarely lower than 1% in gamma-ray spectrometry measurements.</p>'
