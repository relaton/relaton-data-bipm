abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The uncertainties in internal gas counting will be broken down
    into counting uncertainties and gas handling uncertainties. Counting statistics,
    spectrum analysis, and electronic uncertainties will be discussed with respect
    to the actual counting of the activity. The effects of the gas handling and quantities
    of counting and sample gases on the uncertainty in the determination of the activity
    will be included when describing the uncertainties arising in the sample preparation.</p>
