    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The uncertainties in surface emission rates determined by gas-flow proportional counters (multiwired) are broken down into alpha and beta emission rate determinations. Counting statistics, spectrum analysis, and electronic uncertainties are discussed with respect to the actual counting of the respective emission rate. The effects of source construction on the uncertainties are also examined.</p>
