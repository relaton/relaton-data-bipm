abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In radionuclide metrology, the assessment of activity concentrations
    is directly related to the mass determination in quantitative source preparation.
    As far as primary measurements are concerned, the associated weighing uncertainty
    has a non-negligible contribution in the uncertainty budget. Several parameters
    influencing the mass determination have to be considered in source preparation
    and for the evaluation of the weighing uncertainty: technical specifications of
    calibrated balances, environmental quantities such as air buoyancy and other disturbance
    sources like electrostatic effects. The accuracy of mass determination is also
    conditioned by good practices in source preparation. This article reviews the
    different parameters in the evaluation of the weighing uncertainty. Its aim is
    also to give some guidance on how to achieve the smallest uncertainty.</p>'
