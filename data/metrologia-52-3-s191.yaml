abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In radionuclide metrology, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is widely
    used to compute parameters associated with primary measurements or calibration
    factors. Although MC methods are used to estimate uncertainties, the uncertainty
    associated with radiation transport in MC calculations is usually difficult to
    estimate. Counting statistics is the most obvious component of MC uncertainty
    and has to be checked carefully, particularly when variance reduction is used.
    However, in most cases fluctuations associated with counting statistics can be
    reduced using sufficient computing power. Cross-section data have intrinsic uncertainties
    that induce correlations when apparently independent codes are compared. Their
    effect on the uncertainty of the estimated parameter is difficult to determine
    and varies widely from case to case. Finally, the most significant uncertainty
    component for radionuclide applications is usually that associated with the detector
    geometry. Recent 2D and 3D x-ray imaging tools may be utilized, but comparison
    with experimental data as well as adjustments of parameters are usually inevitable.</p>
