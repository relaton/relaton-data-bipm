abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper discusses basic theoretical strategies used to deal
    with measurement uncertainties arising from different experimental situations.
    It attempts to indicate the most appropriate method of obtaining a reliable estimate
    of the quantity to be evaluated depending on the characteristics of the data available.
    The theoretical strategies discussed are supported by experimental detail, and
    the conditions and results have been taken from examples in the field of radionuclide
    metrology. Special care regarding the correct treatment of covariances is emphasized
    because of the unreliability of the results obtained if these are neglected.</p>
