    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper discusses basic theoretical strategies used to deal with measurement uncertainties arising from different experimental situations. It attempts to indicate the most appropriate method of obtaining a reliable estimate of the quantity to be evaluated depending on the characteristics of the data available. The theoretical strategies discussed are supported by experimental detail, and the conditions and results have been taken from examples in the field of radionuclide metrology. Special care regarding the correct treatment of covariances is emphasized because of the unreliability of the results obtained if these are neglected.</p>
