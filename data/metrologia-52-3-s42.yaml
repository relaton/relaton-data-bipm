abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This chapter presents possible uses and examples of Monte Carlo
    methods for the evaluation of uncertainties in the field of radionuclide metrology.
    The method is already well documented in GUM supplement 1, but here we present
    a more restrictive approach, where the quantities of interest calculated by the
    Monte Carlo method are estimators of the expectation and standard deviation of
    the measurand, and the Monte Carlo method is used to propagate the uncertainties
    of the input parameters through the measurement model. This approach is illustrated
    by an example of the activity calibration of a<sup>103</sup>Pd source by liquid
    scintillation counting and the calculation of a linear regression on experimental
    data points. An electronic supplement presents some algorithms which may be used
    to generate random numbers with various statistical distributions, for the implementation
    of this Monte Carlo calculation method.</p>
