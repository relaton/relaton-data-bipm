abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Half-life measurements of radionuclides are undeservedly perceived
    as ‘easy’ and the experimental uncertainties are commonly underestimated. Data
    evaluators, scanning the literature, are faced with bad documentation, lack of
    traceability, incomplete uncertainty budgets and discrepant results. Poor control
    of uncertainties has its implications for the end-user community, varying from
    limitations to the accuracy and reliability of nuclear-based analytical techniques
    to the fundamental question whether half-lives are invariable or not. This paper
    addresses some issues from the viewpoints of the user community and of the decay
    data provider. It addresses the propagation of the uncertainty of the half-life
    in activity measurements and discusses different types of half-life measurements,
    typical parameters influencing their uncertainty, a tool to propagate the uncertainties
    and suggestions for a more complete reporting style. Problems and solutions are
    illustrated with striking examples from literature.</p>
