abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Over the years, scientists have compiled and evaluated experimental
    results and combined these with theoretical studies with the goal of obtaining
    the best values, and their uncertainties, for the quantities related to radioactive
    decay. To meet the demand, an international group, the Decay Data Evaluation Project,
    was organised in 1995. The methodology adopted by this group is detailed. Some
    examples are given explaining how the final uncertainties are assessed from the
    experimental results and their uncertainties.</p>
