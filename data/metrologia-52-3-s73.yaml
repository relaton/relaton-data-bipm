abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Specific uncertainty components of counting at a defined solid
    angle are discussed. It is potentially an extremely accurate technique for primary
    standardisation of activity of alpha emitters and low-energy x-ray emitters. Owing
    to its reproducibility, it is very well suited for half-life measurements. Considered
    sources of uncertainty are 1) source–detector geometry, 2) solid-angle calculation,
    3) energy loss and self-absorption, 4) scattering, 5) detection efficiency. Other
    sources of uncertainty, such as source weighing, counting, dead time and decay
    data are common to other standardisation methods. Statistical uncertainty propagation
    formulas are presented for the solid angle subtended by a circular detector to
    radioactive sources. Computer simulations were performed to investigate aspects
    of particle scattering.</p>
