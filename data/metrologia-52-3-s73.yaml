    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Specific uncertainty components of counting at a defined solid angle are discussed. It is potentially an extremely accurate technique for primary standardisation of activity of alpha emitters and low-energy x-ray emitters. Owing to its reproducibility, it is very well suited for half-life measurements. Considered sources of uncertainty are 1) source–detector geometry, 2) solid-angle calculation, 3) energy loss and self-absorption, 4) scattering, 5) detection efficiency. Other sources of uncertainty, such as source weighing, counting, dead time and decay data are common to other standardisation methods. Statistical uncertainty propagation formulas are presented for the solid angle subtended by a circular detector to radioactive sources. Computer simulations were performed to investigate aspects of particle scattering.</p>
