abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The 4πβ–γ coincidence counting method and its close relatives
    are widely used for the primary standardization of radioactivity. Both the general
    formalism and specific implementation of these methods have been well-documented.
    In particular, previous papers contain the extrapolation equations used for various
    decay schemes, methods for determining model parameters and, in some cases, tabulated
    uncertainty budgets. Two things often lacking from experimental reports are both
    the rationale for estimating uncertainties in a specific way and the details of
    exactly how a specific component of uncertainty was estimated. Furthermore, correlations
    among the components of uncertainty are rarely mentioned.</p><p>To fill in these
    gaps, the present article shares the best-practices from a few practitioners of
    this craft. We explain and demonstrate with examples of how these approaches can
    be used to estimate the uncertainty of the reported massic activity. We describe
    uncertainties due to measurement variability, extrapolation functions, dead-time
    and resolving-time effects, gravimetric links, and nuclear and atomic data. Most
    importantly, a thorough understanding of the measurement system and its response
    to the decay under study can be used to derive a robust estimate of the measurement
    uncertainty.</p>
