abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The 4πγ-counting technique is recognized as a powerful primary
    method for the standardization of radionuclides decaying with abundant gamma emissions.
    Based on the use of a gamma detector in quasi 4π-geometry, a detection efficiency
    close to 100% and a low uncertainty can be achieved thanks to the summing effect
    of subsequent gamma transitions. Uncertainties have to be assigned to the realistic
    modelling of the source–detector geometry with respect to dimensions, density
    and material composition, the calculation of the total counting efficiency of
    the detector for the various emitted radiation, and the effect of possible flaws
    in the decay scheme of a radionuclide on the calculated total efficiency. Other
    uncertainty factors pertain to typical metrological sources of uncertainty, such
    as weighing, nuclear counting with pulse pile-up and system dead-time effects,
    impurity corrections, decay corrections, timing and frequency, etc. In order to
    ensure good metrological practices at NMIs, the uncertainties particular to the
    method are discussed.</p>
