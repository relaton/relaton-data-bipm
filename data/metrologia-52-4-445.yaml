    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Permanent magnets with high-permeability yokes have been widely used in watt balances for supplying a robust and strong magnetic field at the coil position. Subjected to the mechanical realization, only several <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>z</italic>) (radial magnetic field along the vertical direction) profiles can be measured by coils or a magnetic probe for field characterization. In this article, we present an algorithm that can construct the global magnetic field of the air gap based on <italic>N</italic>(<italic>N</italic> ⩾ 1) additional measurements of <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>z</italic>) profiles. The proposed algorithm is realized by polynomially estimating the <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>) function with analysis of basic relations between two magnetic components in air gap, i.e. <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>, <italic>z</italic>) and <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>(<italic>r</italic>, <italic>z</italic>), following Maxwell’s equations. The algorithm, verified by FEM simulations, can characterize the three-dimensional contribution of the magnetic field for a watt balance magnet with acceptable accuracy, which would supply basic field parameters for alignment and misalignment corrections.</p>
