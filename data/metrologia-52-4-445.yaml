abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Permanent magnets with high-permeability yokes have been widely
    used in watt balances for supplying a robust and strong magnetic field at the
    coil position. Subjected to the mechanical realization, only several B<sub>r</sub>(z)
    (radial magnetic field along the vertical direction) profiles can be measured
    by coils or a magnetic probe for field characterization. In this article, we present
    an algorithm that can construct the global magnetic field of the air gap based
    on N(N ⩾ 1) additional measurements of B<sub>r</sub>(z) profiles. The proposed
    algorithm is realized by polynomially estimating the B<sub>z</sub>(r) function
    with analysis of basic relations between two magnetic components in air gap, i.e.
    B<sub>r</sub>(r, z) and B<sub>z</sub>(r, z), following Maxwell’s equations. The
    algorithm, verified by FEM simulations, can characterize the three-dimensional
    contribution of the magnetic field for a watt balance magnet with acceptable accuracy,
    which would supply basic field parameters for alignment and misalignment corrections.</p>
