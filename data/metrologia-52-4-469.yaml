    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this paper, the design and analysis of a novel coaxial type N verification standard based on an air-line is presented. The measurement uncertainty budget is computed by taking into account the mechanical and dielectric tolerances, thus allowing the determination of the transmission loss uncertainties of the verification standard. The calculated results are obtained by using commercially available electromagnetic software. The data analysis is carried out for complex-valued quantities. The measurement uncertainty due to different error sources is computed according to the <italic>Law of Propagation of Uncertainty</italic>. Simulated and experimental results are compared to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.</p>
