abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The diffusion of silver through quartz at high temperatures
    leads to contamination of the platinum sensing element of high temperature platinum
    resistance thermometers. While some protection of the PRT element may be afforded
    by the application of appropriate electric fields, the contamination of the quartz
    elements of silver fixed points causes their premature failure. Contamination
    is evidenced by the yellowish colour imparted to the glass by the silver particles
    growing within the quartz glass matrix. The presence of silver as the contaminating
    element has been confirmed unambiguously through energy dispersive x-ray analysis
    and secondary ion mass spectrometry. To mitigate the risk of silver contamination,
    the gold point is proposed as an alternative calibration point. PRT resistance
    ratios measured at the freezing points of silver and gold in different laboratories
    at different times are highly correlated. This suggests that the ITS-90 reference
    function might be extrapolated to 1064.18 °C (the gold fixed point). However,
    it remains unclear from the gold and silver PRT resistance ratios from the literature
    whether extrapolation of the reference function leads to the correct value at
    the gold point. A direct comparison of gold fixed points may be required to resolve
    the inconsistencies. Additional PRT data may help resolve the discrepancy.</p>
