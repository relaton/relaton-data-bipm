abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The expanded measurement uncertainty of a complex quantity is
    a region in the complex plane surrounding the measured value. When an estimate
    is expressed in polar coordinates, simultaneous intervals expressing the uncertainty
    in the radial and angular coordinates define an annular sector. The performance
    of annular sectors as uncertainty regions is assessed when the respective uncertainty
    interval calculations follow the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.
    That approach is found to be satisfactory provided the measurand is far from the
    origin and an appropriate coverage factor is used. An alternative, more conservative,
    method is investigated that achieves no less than nominal coverage probability
    for any measurand.</p>
