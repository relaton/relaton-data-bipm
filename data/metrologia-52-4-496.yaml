abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We demonstrate a proton spin echo magnetometer, in which the
    interrogation time is not limited by T2&ast; > and can be prolonged to T<sub>2</sub>.
    Therefore, even under a severe field gradient, the precision of the measurement
    does not degrade. We devised a phase linearization method that enables accurate
    estimation of the precession frequency from a spin-echo train. With proton spins
    in deoxygenated tetramethylsilane and a superconducting quantum interference device-detected
    NMR system at KRISS, an average field of around 5 μT was measured with an uncertainty
    of 0.42 nT in the presence of a field gradient of 12.8 μT m<sup>−1</sup>. This
    implies that our system tolerated a 25% variation in magnetic field over the sample
    area. The proton spin-echo magnetometer will be useful in measuring magnetic fields
    without compensating for residual field gradients.</p>
