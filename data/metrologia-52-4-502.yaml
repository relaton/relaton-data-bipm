abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>With increased interest in heat assisted magnetic recording
    (HAMR), the thermal reflection coefficient of HAMR media becomes more important,
    as it is related to the change of optical parameters of the media at different
    temperatures and can potentially be used for non-contact temperature measurement.
    In this report, we introduce a method to calibrate the thermal reflection coefficient
    of magnetic thin films by in situ measurement of the thermal reflectance as well
    as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) signal from the media. In the measurement,
    we use one beam to locally heat up the media, while using a second beam, whose
    diameter and intensity is much smaller, to measure in situ the MOKE and thermal
    reflectance signal of the heated media. We characterize the media temperature
    by heating up the magnetic media with prewritten magnetic patterns in an ultra-high
    vacuum system and the resulting magnetic remanence in the prewritten area is measured
    by magnetic force microscopy. Thus the thermal reflection coefficient is measured
    by performing a pump-probe experiment, with the temperature calibrated at the
    zero thermoremanence temperature of the HAMR media, at which temperature all grains
    under test have reached Curie temperature. This method can be extended to comparative
    studies of the thermo-optical properties of magnetic thin films, whose magnetic
    properties are sensitive to temperature.</p>
