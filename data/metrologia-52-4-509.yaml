abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a systematic study of the effects of reversals
    of current polarity on 1 Ω standard resistors. A selection of 1 Ω standards were
    measured on a dc cryogenic current comparator bridge and also on an ac current
    comparator bridge operating at 1 Hz. We find that the apparent 4 terminal resistance
    depends strongly on the dc reversal rate, in one case showing a variation of more
    than 0.1 μΩ/Ω for cycle times between 10 s and 1000 s. Even in the best cases,
    effects of at least 0.01 μΩ/Ω are present. Furthermore, the assumption that the
    apparent resistance value converges to a limiting value for long waiting times
    after reversal is not always upheld, making it difficult to quote a simple dc
    value. Existing models of Peltier heating at wire junctions do not completely
    explain our observations. The problems presented have been the limiting factor
    for 1 Ω measurements as part of a recent on-site comparison of quantum Hall effect
    resistance standards.</p>
