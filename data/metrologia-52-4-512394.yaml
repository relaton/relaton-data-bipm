abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, the design and analysis of a novel coaxial type
    N verification standard based on an air-line is presented. The measurement uncertainty
    budget is computed by taking into account the mechanical and dielectric tolerances,
    thus allowing the determination of the transmission loss uncertainties of the
    verification standard. The calculated results are obtained by using commercially
    available electromagnetic software. The data analysis is carried out for complex-valued
    quantities. The measurement uncertainty due to different error sources is computed
    according to the Law of Propagation of Uncertainty. Simulated and experimental
    results are compared to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.</p>
