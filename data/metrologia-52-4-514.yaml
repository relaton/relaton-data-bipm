    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We extend the mathematical model based on stochastic differential equations describing the error gained by an atomic clock to the cases of anomalous behavior including jumps and an increase of instability. We prove an exact iterative solution that can be useful for clock simulation, prediction, and interpretation, as well as for the understanding of the impact of clock error in the overall system in which clocks may be inserted as, for example, the Global Satellite Navigation Systems.</p>
