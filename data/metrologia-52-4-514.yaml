abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We extend the mathematical model based on stochastic differential
    equations describing the error gained by an atomic clock to the cases of anomalous
    behavior including jumps and an increase of instability. We prove an exact iterative
    solution that can be useful for clock simulation, prediction, and interpretation,
    as well as for the understanding of the impact of clock error in the overall system
    in which clocks may be inserted as, for example, the Global Satellite Navigation
    Systems.</p>
