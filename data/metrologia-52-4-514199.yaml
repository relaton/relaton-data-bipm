abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Until a new definition of the kilogram has been adopted, the
    SI unit of mass remains defined in terms of an artefact, the international prototype
    of the kilogram K, > which is not readily available for regular recalibration
    of BIPM prototypes used for the calibration of national prototypes. Since 1889
    the working hypothesis has been that the platinum–iridium prototypes are stable
    mass standards, although mass comparisons indicate that this is not entirely true.
    In this paper we present a method for improving metrological traceability to the
    international prototype K > by modelling the change in mass of prototypes over
    time and evaluate the model parameters by a weighted least squares adjustment.
    The method has been applied to comparisons between 18 prototypes performed at
    the BIPM in the period 1889–2009. The mass values predicted by the model are compared
    to the mass values assigned by BIPM in the period 1992–2009 and to results of
    the Extraordinary Calibrations performed at BIPM in 2014 using the international
    prototype K > as reference standard.</p>
