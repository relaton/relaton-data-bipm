abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the measurement of the physical adsorption
    of water vapour on platinum–iridium surfaces using a vacuum mass comparator. This
    value is of importance for redefining the kilogram, which will be realized under
    vacuum in the near future. Mirror-polished artefacts, consisting of a reference
    artefact and a test artefact, were manufactured for this experiment. The surface
    area difference between the reference and test artefacts was 226.2 cm<sup>2</sup>.
    This surface area difference was approximately 3.2 times the geometric surface
    area of the prototype of the kilogram made of platinum–iridium (71.7 cm<sup>2</sup>).
    The measurement results indicate that the amount of physical adsorption at a relative
    humidity of 50% is 0.0129 μg cm&#x2212;2 >, with a standard uncertainty of 0.0016 μg cm&#x2212;2
    >. This value is 0.03 to 0.16 times that observed in other studies.</p>
