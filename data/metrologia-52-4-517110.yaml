abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A multi-frequency cavitation vessel (RV-multi) has been commissioned
    at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL, UK), with the aim of establishing a
    standard source of acoustic cavitation in water, with reference to which details
    of the cavitation process can be studied and cavitation measurement techniques
    evaluated. The vessel is a cylindrical cavity with a maximum capacity up to 17 L,
    and is designed to work at six frequency ranges, from 21 kHz to 136 kHz, under
    controlled temperature conditions. This paper discusses the design of RV-multi
    and reports experiments carried out to establish the reproducibility of the acoustic
    pressure field established within the vessel and its operating envelope, including
    sensitivity to aspects such as water depth and temperature. The acoustic field
    distribution was determined along the radial and depth directions within the vessel
    using a miniature hydrophone, for two input voltage levels under low power transducer
    excitation conditions (e.g. below the cavitation threshold). Particular care was
    taken in determining peak acoustic pressure locations, as these are critical for
    accompanying cavitation studies. Perturbations of the vessel by the measuring
    hydrophone were also monitored with a bottom-mounted pressure sensor.</p>
