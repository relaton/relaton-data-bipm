abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>AC Josephson voltage standards based on pulse-driven Josephson
    arrays (Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer—JAWS) have recently achieved
    an output voltage of at least 1 V root-mean-square. An ac quantum voltmeter (ac-QVM)
    based on a 2 V programmable Josephson array has been used to verify the quantization
    level of the new JAWS by performing a direct comparison in the frequency range
    from 30 Hz to 2 kHz. The comparison has demonstrated an excellent agreement between
    the two quantum standards of better than 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>. Sources for
    systematic errors have been investigated. The overall uncertainty is found to
    be better than 1.2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> (k = 1) for measurements at a frequency
    of 250 Hz and 1 V amplitude.</p>
