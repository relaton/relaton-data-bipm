abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We derive relativistic corrections for one-way and two-way time
    and frequency transfer over optical fibres neglecting no terms that exceed 1 ps
    in time and 10<sup>−18</sup> in fractional frequency, and estimate their magnitude
    in typical fibre links. We also provide estimates of the uncertainties in the
    evaluation of the relativistic corrections due to imperfect knowledge of parameters
    like the coordinates of the fibre and stations, Earth rotation, or thermal effects
    of the fibre index and length. The links between Teddington(UK) and Paris(F) as
    well as Braunschweig(D) and Paris(F), that are currently under construction, are
    studied as specific examples.</p>
