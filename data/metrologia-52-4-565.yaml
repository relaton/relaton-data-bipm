abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The power spectral density in the Fourier frequency domain,
    and the different variants of the Allan deviation (ADEV) in dependence on the
    averaging time are well established tools to analyse the fluctuation properties
    and frequency instability of an oscillatory signal. It is often supposed that
    the statistical uncertainty of a measured average frequency is given by the ADEV
    at a well-considered averaging time. However, this approach requires further mathematical
    justification and refinement, which has already been done regarding the original
    ADEV for certain noise types. Here we provide the necessary background to use
    the modified Allan deviation (modADEV) and other two-sample deviations to determine
    the uncertainty of weighted frequency averages. The type of two-sample deviation
    used to determine the uncertainty depends on the method used for determination
    of the average. We find that the modADEV, which is connected with &#x039B; >-weighted
    averaging, and the two-sample deviation associated with a linear phase regression
    weighting (parADEV) are, in particular, advantageous for measurements in which
    white phase noise is dominating. Furthermore, we derive a procedure for how to
    minimise the uncertainty of a measurement for a typical combination of white phase
    and frequency noise by adaptive averaging of the data set with different weighting
    functions. Finally, some aspects of the theoretical considerations for real-world
    frequency measurement equipment are discussed.</p>
