    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The results of precision measurements of the <sup>87</sup>Rb ground-state hyperfine transition frequency, which were conducted at NPL from 2009 to 2013, are reported. The resulting frequency, measured using NPLâ€™s Cs and Rb atomic frequency standards, demonstrates reasonable agreement with the most recent measurements reported by LNE-SYRTE.</p>
