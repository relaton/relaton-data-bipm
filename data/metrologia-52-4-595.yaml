abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The results of precision measurements of the<sup>87</sup>Rb
    ground-state hyperfine transition frequency, which were conducted at NPL from
    2009 to 2013, are reported. The resulting frequency, measured using NPLâ€™s Cs and
    Rb atomic frequency standards, demonstrates reasonable agreement with the most
    recent measurements reported by LNE-SYRTE.</p>
