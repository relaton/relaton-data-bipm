abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, a geometrical model for the numerical calculation
    of the integrated effective emissivity of conical isothermal cavities with a lid,
    is described in detail. We make use of the Montecarlo method and the ‘back ray
    tracing’ technique, assuming diffuse reflection and a detector situated at an
    arbitrary distance from the cavity aperture. First, the geometry of the problem
    is discussed and the local hemispherical emissivity profiles along the cone generatrix
    are calculated for different configurations. Then we proceed to the validation
    of the model, by calculating the distribution of the reflected photons in the
    interior of the cavity, such as it is provided by the numerical algorithm. The
    calculated distribution is compared with theoretical values, obtained from the
    expressions of the view factors for the conical geometry.</p><p>The calculated
    values for the local and integrated effective emissivity are compared with results
    published by other authors, highlighting the differences between them, and the
    internal consistency of our model is demonstrated. Special attention to the calculation
    of the view factors in conical cavities affected by vignetting due to the obstruction
    produced by the lid, is paid. The view factors of points at the penumbral region
    are numerically calculated, applying the Montecarlo method, including a complete
    analysis of the uncertainty.</p>
