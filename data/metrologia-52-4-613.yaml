abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In their paper, Mohr and Phillips demonstrate that the SI’s
    representation of ‘plane angle’ as dimensionless rather than as an independent
    dimensional quantity continues to create confusion. The authors also address perceived
    problems in terminology regarding numbers of items, such as discrete events or
    particles. However, their general philosophy of equating the dimensionless ‘number
    of items’ to ‘(number of items)  ×  (item name)’ leads to false conclusions, such
    as that the hertz is equal to 2π radians per second, and therefore not a coherent
    SI unit. In attempting to specify kinds of entities, the authors introduce descriptive
    labels into their supposed ‘units,’ resulting in confusion between number of entities
    and amount of substance. And, in discussing the mole and related fundamental constants,
    they incorrectly portray the Avogadro constant as a conversion factor, identically
    equal to 1, thereby corrupting the relationships between the Boltzmann constant
    and the universal gas constant, and between the elementary charge and the Faraday
    constant. In my comment, I explain and correct these and related errors.</p>
