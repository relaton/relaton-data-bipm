abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The application of<sup>1</sup>H quantitative nuclear magnetic
    resonance (<sup>1</sup>H qNMR) for purity determination of organic compounds is
    well documented in the literature. The aim of this work is to determine if the<sup>1</sup>H
    qNMR method produces consistent values for the purity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
    (PAH) and is sufficiently accurate for the certification of reference materials.
    For this purpose, 15 different commercial PAH standards had their purity evaluated
    by<sup>1</sup>H qNMR. The purity values and the associated expanded uncertainty
    of the 15 analyzed PAH ranged from (97.21 ± 0.28)% to (99.52 ± 1.10)%. The expanded
    measurement uncertainties were acceptable for the certification of reference materials
    and the purity values were in the expected range, confirming, therefore, that
    qNMR is appropriate for this type of analysis.</p>
