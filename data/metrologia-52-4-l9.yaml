abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In an effort to further reduce the uncertainties in the triple
    point temperatures of<sup>20</sup>Ne and<sup>22</sup>Ne, already established in
    previous publications, at INRIM a cell for each of the two high-purity isotopes
    was mounted on the same copper block and their triple points were realized subsequently
    one after the other, allowing a reduction of the total experimental uncertainty
    on their temperature difference due to a full correlation of some of the uncertainty
    components arising from this type of realization. The two meltings remain perfectly
    distinct and do not interfere with each other, being the temperature difference
    of 0.147 K while the melting ranges are below 0.2 mK. The main difference with
    respect to single measurements (mounting a single cell at a time), lies in the
    adiabatic conditions during measurement, which are hardly reproducible when mounting
    a single cell at a time, leading to one of the dominant uncertainty contributions,
    15 μK (single). In the present work, the uncertainty component due to the adiabatic
    conditions is reduced by using a measurement in sequence (mounting the two cells
    at a time), 1 μK. Thus, an improved reliability in the experimental realization
    is obtained as reflected in the experimental contributions to the uncertainty
    budget.</p>
