abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Albeit the utilization of halogenated hydrocarbons in new devices
    is suppressed gradually, due to the protection of environment, large amounts of
    them still remain in existing equipment. It is important for metrology to carry
    out proper leak measurements of these devices during their service life with traceability
    to high quality primary standards. Efficient methods have been developed for vacuum
    leaks (gas outflow into vacuum) but halogenated hydrocarbons leak out into the
    atmosphere under real conditions. The design of primary standards that meet this
    condition is considerably more difficult and they are still rather rare. This
    paper gives an insight into the principles used for these standards, which can
    be classified into two groups: methods sensitive to the gas species and methods
    insensitive to the gas species.</p>'
