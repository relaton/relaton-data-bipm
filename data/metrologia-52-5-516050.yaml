abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the determination of the Boltzmann constant by dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry, the uncertainty of pressure measurements in helium up to 7 MPa
    has been decreased compared with previous achievements (Sabuga 2011 PTB-Mitt.
    121 247–55). This was possible by performing comprehensive cross-float experiments
    with a system of six special pressure balances and the synchronization of their
    effective areas. It is now possible to measure a helium pressure of 7 MPa with
    a relative standard uncertainty of 1.0 ppm applying a 2 cm<sup>2</sup> piston-cylinder
    unit, the calibration of which is traceable to the SI base units.</p>
