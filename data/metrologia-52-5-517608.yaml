abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An element-based reductive approach provides an effective means
    of realizing International System of Units (SI) traceability for high-purity biological
    standards. Here, we develop an absolute protein quantification method using double
    isotope dilution (ID) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) combined
    with microwave-assisted acid digestion for the first time. We validated the method
    and applied it to certify the candidate protein certified reference material (CRM)
    of human growth hormone (hGH). The concentration of hGH was determined by analysing
    the total amount of sulfur in hGH. Next, the size-exclusion chromatography method
    was used with ICP-MS to characterize and quantify sulfur-containing impurities.
    By subtracting the contribution of sulfur-containing impurities from the total
    sulfur content in the hGH CRM, we obtained a SI-traceable certification value.
    The quantification result obtained with the present method based on sulfur analysis
    was in excellent agreement with the result determined via a well-established protein
    quantification method based on amino acid analysis using conventional acid hydrolysis
    combined with an ID liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The element-based
    protein quantification method developed here can be generally used for SI-traceable
    absolute quantification of proteins, especially pure-protein standards.</p>
