abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A method is presented for analysing over-determined sets of
    clock frequency comparison data involving standards based on a number of different
    reference transitions. This least-squares adjustment procedure, which is based
    on the method used by CODATA to derive a self-consistent set of values for the
    fundamental physical constants, can be used to derive optimized values for the
    frequency ratios of all possible pairs of reference transitions. It is demonstrated
    to reproduce the frequency values recommended by the International Committee for
    Weights and Measures, when using the same input data used to derive those values.
    The effects of including more recently published data in the evaluation is discussed
    and the importance of accounting for correlations between the input data is emphasised.</p>
