abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Precision absolute gravity measurements are growing in importance,
    especially in the context of the new definition of the kilogram. For the case
    of free fall absolute gravimeters with a Michelson-type interferometer tracking
    the position of a free falling body, one of the effects that needs to be taken
    into account is the ‘speed of light perturbation’ due to the finite speed of propagation
    of light. This effect has been extensively discussed in the past, and there is
    at present a disagreement between different studies. In this work, we present
    the analysis of new data and confirm the result expected from the theoretical
    analysis applied nowadays in free-fall gravimeters. We also review the standard
    derivations of this effect (by using phase shift or Doppler effect arguments)
    and show their equivalence.</p>
