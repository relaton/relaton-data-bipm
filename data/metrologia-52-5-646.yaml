abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the latest implementation of the ESTI reference
    cell set at the European solar test installation. The set consists of five photovoltaic
    reference cells used to measure solar irradiance. Each cell has been calibrated
    multiple times by primary methods. The stability of the set has been maintained
    and monitored over a long time period (up to 20 years). Taken together this allowed
    a rigorous determination of the assigned calibration value for each cell based
    on the weighted average, together with its uncertainty. This has led to unprecedented
    low uncertainties of 0.23% (k = 2), which are at least a factor of two smaller
    than achievable with any single primary calibration. Using these cells for calibrating
    secondary reference cells with a dedicated set-up leads to uncertainties for these
    secondary calibrated cells which is of the same order as the best primary calibration
    methods.</p>
