abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present an optomechanical accelerometer with high dynamic
    range, high bandwidth and readout noise levels below 7.8&#x00D7;10&#x2212;5 >
    m s<sup>−2</sup>/Hz >. The straightforward assembly and low cost of our device
    makes it a prime candidate for on-site reference calibrations and autonomous navigation.
    We present experimental data taken with a vacuum sealed, portable prototype and
    deduce the achieved bias stability and the accuracy of the sensitivity. Additionally,
    we present a comprehensive model of the device physics that we use to analyze
    the fundamental noise sources and accuracy limitations of such devices.</p>
