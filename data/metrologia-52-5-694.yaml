abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this work, the freezing point of tin (Sn FP) was realized
    by inside nucleation where the supercooling of tin and the reheating of the sample
    after the nucleation were achieved without extracting the cell from an isothermal
    apparatus. To this end, a novel hydraulic temperature control technique, which
    was based on the thermo-hydraulic characteristics of a pressure-controlled loop
    heat pipe (LHP), was employed to provide a slow cooling of the sample for deep
    supercooling and fast reheating after nucleation to minimize the amount of initial
    freeze of the sample. The required temperature controls were achieved by the active
    pressure control of a control gas inside the compensation chamber of the pressure-controlled
    LHP, and slow cooling at  −0.05 K min<sup>−1</sup> for the deep supercooling of
    tin and fast heating at 2 K min<sup>−1</sup> for reheating the sample after nucleation
    was attained. Based on this hydraulic temperature control technique, the nucleation
    of tin was realized at supercooling of around 19 K, and a satisfactorily fast
    reheating of the sample to the plateau-producing temperature (i.e. 0.5 K below
    the Sn FP) was achieved without any temperature overshoots of the isothermal region.
    The inside-nucleated Sn FP showed many desirable features compared to the Sn FP
    realized by the conventional outside nucleation method. The longer freezing plateaus
    and the better immersion characteristics of the Sn FP were obtained by inside
    nucleation, and the measured freezing temperature of the inside-nucleated Sn FP
    was as much as 0.37 mK higher than the outside-nucleated Sn FP with an expanded
    uncertainty of 0.19 mK. Details on the experiment are provided and explanations
    for the observed differences are discussed.</p>
