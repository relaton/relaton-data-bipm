abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Double-ended interferometry has several benefits over single-ended
    gauge block interferometry: there is no need for wringing, which wears surfaces
    and requires expertise, and there is improved repeatability, since there is no
    variation due to inconsistent wringing conditions or form errors of the gauge
    block surfaces. Some disadvantages of double-ended interferometry are that absolute
    phase change correction is needed for the gauge block and its uncertainty has
    a double effect on total uncertainty. In addition, elimination of the wavefront
    error is more complicated than with single-ended interferometry. A simple optical
    modification that enables double-ended interferometer (DEI) measurements with
    the MIKES interferometer for long gauge blocks is presented. This modification
    is applicable to almost any single-ended interferometer (SEI). A procedure for
    evaluating the wave front correction for different parts of the interferogram
    of DEI is explained, and a modification and software with capability for nine-point
    phase stepping is presented. Three independent methods for evaluation of the phase
    correction were studied. One of them uses integrating sphere for the surface roughness
    correction and literature values for the phase change due to complex refractive
    index of material correction. The second evaluates the phase correction from the
    difference between DEI and SEI results obtained with a quartz platen. The third
    uses differences—from separate measurements—between the results obtained with
    quartz or steel auxiliary platens. Only a few gauge blocks per set need testing
    to obtain phase correction. SEI and DEI results with different phase correction
    determination methods are presented and evaluated. The uncertainty estimate for
    gauge block calibration with DEI gives a similar standard uncertainty to that
    with the best SEIs, u&equals;(10.0&#x00A0;&thinsp;nm)2&plus;(118&#x00D7;10&#x2212;9L)2
