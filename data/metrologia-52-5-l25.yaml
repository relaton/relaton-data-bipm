abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper considers how decisions on internationally recommended
    datasets are made and implemented and, further, how the ownership of these decisions
    comes about. Examples are given of conventionally agreed data and values where
    the responsibility is clear and comes about through official designation or by
    common usage and practice over long time periods. The example of the dataset describing
    the mass concentration of mercury in air at saturation is discussed in detail.
    This is a case where there are now several competing datasets that are in disagreement
    with each other, some with historical authority and some more recent but, arguably,
    with more robust metrological traceability to the SI. Further, it is elaborated
    that there is no body charged with the responsibility to make a decision on an
    international recommendation for such a dataset. This has led to the situation
    where several competing datasets are in use simultaneously. Close parallels are
    drawn with the current debate over changes to the ozone absorption cross section,
    which has equal importance to the measurement of ozone amount fraction in air
    and to subsequent compliance with air quality legislation. It is noted that in
    the case of the ozone cross section there is already a committee appointed to
    deliberate over any change. We make the proposal that a similar committee, under
    the auspices of IUPAC or the CIPM’s CCQM (if it adopted a reference data function)
    could be formed to perform a similar role for the mass concentration of mercury
    in air at saturation.</p>
