abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The principles, techniques and results from dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry (DCGT) are reviewed. Primary DCGT with helium has been used for
    measuring T–T<sub>90</sub> below the triple point of water (TPW), where T is the
    thermodynamic temperature and T<sub>90</sub> is the temperature on the international
    temperature scale of 1990 (ITS-90), and, in an inverse regime with T as input
    quantity, for determining the Boltzmann constant at the TPW. Furthermore, DCGT
    allows the determination of several important material properties including the
    polarizability of neon and argon as well as the virial coefficients of helium,
    neon, and argon. With interpolating DCGT (IDCGT), the ITS-90 has been approximated
    in the temperature range from 4 K to 25 K. An overview and uncertainty budget
    for each of these applications of DCGT is provided, accompanied by corroborating
    evidence from the literature or, for IDCGT, a CIPM key comparison.</p>
