abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Finite-element calculations of electromagnetic eigenvalues are
    known to converge to the exact solutions in the limit of vanishing element sizes.
    In an extension of previous work (Mehl 2009 Metrologia 46 554–9) the eigenfrequencies
    of the TM1n and TE1n (n  =  1, 2, ··· 6) modes of triaxial ellipsoids were calculated
    as a function of mesh size. Higher-accuracy eigenvalues were obtained through
    a limiting process as the mesh size was reduced; the extrapolation was based on
    the theoretical convergence rate. The difference between the finite-element eigenfrequencies
    and the eigenfrequencies predicted by shape perturbation theory is found to be
    proportional to the cube of the fractional deformation parameter ϵ for all investigated
    modes. For ellipsoids with axes proportional to 1 : 1.0005 : 1.0010, the cubic
    term represents a fractional perturbation of the average TM16 eigenvalue k<sup>2</sup>
    by  −0.16  × 10<sup>  −  6</sup> and the average TE16 eigenvalue by  −0.22  ×
    10<sup>  −  6</sup>. This work adds support to the correctness of the analytic
    second-order formula derived in the previous work, and also demonstrates the usefulness
    of finite-element methods for investigating the quasi-spherical resonators (QSRs)
    used in measurements of the Boltzmann constant. In principle, the method can be
    extended to QSRs whose shape differs from triaxial ellipsoids.</p>
