abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on complementary tests and measurements regarding
    our recent determination of the Boltzmann constant, k<sub>B</sub>, by means of
    Doppler broadening thermometry, also providing additional information as compared
    to previous articles. A revised uncertainty budget is illustrated, including some
    new components that were ignored in previous spectroscopic experiments, and better
    quantifying other components that were estimated to be negligible. In particular,
    we consider the relativistic Doppler effect, the perturbation caused by the finite
    bandwidth of the detection system and the influence of the spontaneous emission
    content of the probe laser. These new components do not increase the global uncertainty
    which still amounts to 24 ppm. Our value for the Boltzmann constant is 1.380 631
    (33)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>, which is the best determination reported
    so far by using an optical method.</p>
