abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The unit of thermodynamic temperature, the kelvin, will be redefined
    in 2018 by fixing the value of the Boltzmann constant, k. The present CODATA recommended
    value of k is determined predominantly by acoustic gas-thermometry results. To
    provide a value of k based on different physical principles, purely electronic
    measurements of k were performed by using a Johnson noise thermometer to compare
    the thermal noise power of a 200  Ω sensing resistor immersed in a triple-point-of-water
    cell to the noise power of a quantum-accurate pseudo-random noise waveform of
    nominally equal noise power. Measurements integrated over a bandwidth of 575 kHz
    and a total integration time of about 33 d gave a measured value of k = 1.3806513(53)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>,
    for which the relative standard uncertainty is 3.9   ×   10<sup>−6</sup> and the
    relative offset from the CODATA 2010 value is +1.8   ×   10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
