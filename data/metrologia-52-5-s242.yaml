    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The unit of thermodynamic temperature, the kelvin, will be redefined in 2018 by fixing the value of the Boltzmann constant, <italic>k</italic>. The present CODATA recommended value of <italic>k</italic> is determined predominantly by acoustic gas-thermometry results. To provide a value of <italic>k</italic> based on different physical principles, purely electronic measurements of <italic>k</italic> were performed by using a Johnson noise thermometer to compare the thermal noise power of a 200  Ω sensing resistor immersed in a triple-point-of-water cell to the noise power of a quantum-accurate pseudo-random noise waveform of nominally equal noise power. Measurements integrated over a bandwidth of 575 kHz and a total integration time of about 33 d gave a measured value of <italic>k</italic> = 1.3806513(53)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>, for which the relative standard uncertainty is 3.9   ×   10<sup>−6</sup> and the relative offset from the CODATA 2010 value is +1.8   ×   10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
