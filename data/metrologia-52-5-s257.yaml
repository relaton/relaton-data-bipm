abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An acoustic gas thermometer was used to achieve a determination
    of the Boltzmann constant, k<sub>B</sub>, using a misaligned stainless steel (316L)
    spherical cavity with an internal volume of approximately 268 cm<sup>3</sup>.
    Measurements of the speed of sound while the cavity is filled with argon at the
    temperature of the triple point of water, 273.16 K, and at different pressures
    between 78.2 kPa and 0.9 MPa, were used to extrapolate the value of the speed
    of sound in argon at zero pressure. The internal volume of the resonator was accurately
    determined by measuring microwave resonance frequencies at the same temperature
    and pressure conditions as for the acoustic measurements. The measurements were
    taken at pressures from 78.2 kPa up to 901.3 kPa, and at 273.16 K. As the results
    of the measurements, we determined k<sub>B</sub> = (1.380 644 1   ±   0.000 022
    1)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup> which means a relative standard uncertainty
    of 16 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>
