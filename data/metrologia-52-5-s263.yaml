abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Boltzmann constant k has been determined from a measurement
    of the speed of sound in helium gas in a quasi-spherical resonator (volume 0.5
    l) maintained at a temperature close to the triple point of water (273.16 K).
    The acoustic velocity c is deduced from measured acoustic resonance frequencies
    and the dimensions of the quasi-sphere, the latter being obtained via simultaneous
    microwave resonance. Values of c are extrapolated to the zero pressure limit of
    ideal gas behaviour. We find k&equals;1.380&thinsp;6487&lpar;14&rpar;&#x00D7;10&#x2212;23
    > J⋅K<sup>−1</sup>, a result consistent with previous measurements in our group
    and elsewhere. The value for k, which has a relative standard uncertainty of 1.02
    ppm, lies 0.02 ppm below that of the CODATA 2010 adjustment.</p>
