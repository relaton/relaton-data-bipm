abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Spectroscopy has been a key driver and motivator of new understanding
    at the heart of physics. Here we describe high-precision measurements of the absorption
    lineshape of an atomic gas with an aim towards primary thermometry. We describe
    our progress in pushing this type of spectroscopy to the ultimate limit, in particular
    in describing experimental work with Rubidium and Cesium, although we also consider
    the potential for other elements in expanding the precision, accuracy and range
    of the approach. We describe the important technical and theoretical limits which
    need to be overcome in order to obtain accurate and precise resultsâ€”these challenges
    are not unique to atomic spectroscopy but are likely to afflict all high precision
    spectroscopy measurements. We obtain a value for kB&equals;1.380&thinsp;545&lpar;98&rpar;&#x00D7;10&#x2212;23
    > J K&#x2212;1 > where the 71 ppm uncertainty arises with difficulties in defining
    the Lorentzian component of the lineshape.</p>
