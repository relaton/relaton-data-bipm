abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In 2013, a team from NPL, Cranfield University and SUERC published
    an estimate of the Boltzmann constant based on precision measurements of the speed
    of sound in argon. A key component of our results was an estimate of the molar
    mass of the argon gas used in our measurements. To achieve this we made precision
    comparison measurements of the isotope ratios found in our experimental argon
    against the ratios of argon isotopes found in atmospheric air. We then used a
    previous measurement of the atmospheric argon isotope ratios to calibrate the
    relative sensitivity of the mass spectrometer to different argon isotopes. The
    previous measurement of the atmospheric argon isotope ratios was carried out at
    KRISS using a mass spectrometer calibrated using argon samples of known isotopic
    composition, which had been prepared gravimetrically.</p><p>We report here a new
    measurement made at KRISS in October 2014, which directly compared a sample of
    our experimental gas against the same gravimetrically-prepared argon samples.
    We consider that this direct comparison has to take precedence over our previous
    more indirect comparison. This measurement implies a molar mass which is 2.73(60)
    parts in 10<sup>6</sup> lighter than our 2013 estimate, a shift which is seven
    times our 2013 estimate of the uncertainty in the molar mass.</p><p>In this paper
    we review the procedures used in our 2013 estimate of molar mass; describe the
    2014 measurement; highlight some questions raised by the large change in our estimate
    of molar mass; and describe how we intend to address the inconsistencies between
    them. We also consider the effect of a new estimate of the low pressure thermal
    conductivity of argon at 273.16â€‰K. Finally we report our new best estimate of
    the Boltzmann constant with revised uncertainty, taking account of the new estimates
    for the molar mass and the thermal conductivity of the argon.</p>
