abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>At its 24th meeting (2011) the General Conference on Weights
    and Measures noted the CIPM’s intention to express new definitions of the kilogram,
    ampere, kelvin, and mole in terms of fixed numerical values of the Planck constant,
    elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and Avogadro constant, respectively. The
    changes proposed for the International System of Units will not actually be adopted
    until the experimental results on the new definitional constants that are proposed
    have reached a further stage of refinement. This paper provides an overview of
    the activities and progress of the research groups who are carrying out experiments
    to determine the Boltzmann constant. The most promising methods, acoustic gas
    thermometry, dielectric-constant gas thermometry, Johnson noise thermometry and
    Doppler-broadening thermometry, are reviewed. The prospects for meeting the requirements
    of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry for a new definition of the kelvin
    are discussed.</p>
