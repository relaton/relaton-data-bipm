    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>At its 24th meeting (2011) the General Conference on Weights and Measures noted the CIPM’s intention to express new definitions of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole in terms of fixed numerical values of the Planck constant, elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and Avogadro constant, respectively. The changes proposed for the International System of Units will not actually be adopted until the experimental results on the new definitional constants that are proposed have reached a further stage of refinement. This paper provides an overview of the activities and progress of the research groups who are carrying out experiments to determine the Boltzmann constant. The most promising methods, acoustic gas thermometry, dielectric-constant gas thermometry, Johnson noise thermometry and Doppler-broadening thermometry, are reviewed. The prospects for meeting the requirements of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry for a new definition of the kelvin are discussed.</p>
