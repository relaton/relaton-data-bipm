abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We review correlated uncertainties among the accurate determinations
    of the Boltzmann constant kB > that used the techniques of primary acoustic gas
    thermometry (AGT). We find correlated uncertainty contributions from four sources:
    (1) the uncertain chemical and isotopic compositions of the test gases that lead
    to an uncertain average molar mass, (2) measurements of the temperature, (3) measurements
    of the shape and dimensions of the cavity resonators, and (4) fitting acoustic
    resonance frequencies as a function of the pressure. Molar-mass-dependent uncertainties
    are correlated among those measurements that used argon with isotopic abundances
    determined using an isotopic standard prepared at the Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science in 2006. Correlated, cavity-dependent uncertainties result
    from using the same cavity for more than one measurement. Small, correlated uncertainties
    propagate into all the AGT determinations of kB > when acoustic resonance frequencies
    are fit for kB > using uncertain literature data for the Avogadro constant and
    for the thermal conductivity and the higher acoustic virial coefficients of helium
    or argon.</p>'
