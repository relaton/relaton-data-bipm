abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A Doppler broadening thermometry (DBT) instrument is built based
    on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) for the precise determination of the Boltzmann
    constant. Compared with conventional direct absorption methods, the high-sensitivity
    of CRDS allows one to reach a satisfactory precision at lower sample pressures,
    which reduces the influence due to collisions. By recording the spectrum of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>
    at 787 nm, we demonstrate a statistical uncertainty of 6 ppm (part per million)
    in the determined linewidth values by several hours’ measurement at a sample pressure
    of 1.5 Pa. As for the spectroscopy-determined temperatures, although with a reproducibility
    better than 10 ppm, we found a systematic deviation of about 800 ppm, which is
    attributed to ‘hidden’ weak lines overlapped with the selected transition at 787 nm.
    Our analysis indicates that it is feasible to pursue a DBT measurement toward
    the 1 ppm precision using cavity ring-down spectroscopy of a CO line at 1.57 &#x03BC;
