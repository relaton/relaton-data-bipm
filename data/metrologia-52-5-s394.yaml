abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We determined accurate values of ratios among the average molar
    masses M<sub>Ar</sub> of 9 argon samples using two completely-independent techniques:
    (1) mass spectrometry and (2) measured ratios of acoustic resonance frequencies.
    The two techniques yielded mutually consistent ratios (RMS deviation of 0.16   ×   10<sup>−6</sup>
    M<sub>Ar</sub> from the expected correlation) for the 9 samples of highly-purified,
    commercially-purchased argon with values of M<sub>Ar</sub> spanning a range of
    2   ×   10<sup>−6</sup> M<sub>Ar</sub>. Among the 9 argon samples, two were traceable
    to recent, accurate, argon-based measurements of the Boltzmann constant k<sub>B</sub>
    using primary acoustic gas thermometers (AGT). Additionally we determined our
    absolute values of M<sub>Ar</sub> traceable to two, completely-independent, isotopic-reference
    standards; one standard was prepared gravimetrically at KRISS in 2006; the other
    standard was isotopically-enriched<sup>40</sup>Ar that was used during NIST’s
    1988 measurement of k<sub>B</sub> and was sent to NIM for this research. The absolute
    values of M<sub>Ar</sub> determined using the KRISS standard have the relative
    standard uncertainty u<sub>r</sub>(M<sub>Ar</sub>)  =  0.70   ×   10<sup>−6</sup>
    (Uncertainties here are one standard uncertainty.); they agree with values of
    M<sub>Ar</sub> determined at NIM using an AGT within the uncertainty of the comparison
    u<sub>r</sub>(M<sub>Ar</sub>)  =  0.93   ×   10<sup>−6</sup>. If our measurements
    of M<sub>Ar</sub> are accepted, the difference between two, recent, argon-based,
    AGT measurements of k<sub>B</sub> decreases from (2.77   ±   1.43)  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>
    k<sub>B</sub> to (0.16   ±   1.28)  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> k<sub>B</sub>. This decrease
    enables the calculation of a meaningful, weighted average value of k<sub>B</sub>
    with a uncertainty u<sub>r</sub>(k<sub>B</sub>)  ≈  0.6   ×   10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>'
