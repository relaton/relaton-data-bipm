abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Improved measurements on silicon crystal samples highly enriched
    in the<sup>28</sup>Si isotope (known as ‘Si28’ or AVO28 crystal material) have
    been carried out at PTB to investigate local isotopic variations in the original
    crystal. This material was used for the determination of the Avogadro constant  N<sub>A</sub>
    and therefore plays an important role in the upcoming redefinition of the SI units
    kilogram and mole, using fundamental constants. Subsamples of the original crystal
    have been extensively studied over the past few years at the National Research
    Council (NRC, Canada), the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ, Japan),
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA), the National Institute
    of Metrology (NIM, People’s Republic of China), and multiple times at PTB. In
    this study, four to five discrete, but adjacent samples were taken from three
    distinct axial positions of the crystal to obtain a more systematic and comprehensive
    understanding of the distribution of the isotopic composition and molar mass throughout
    the crystal. Moreover, improved state-of-the-art techniques in the experimental
    measurements as well as the evaluation approach and the determination of the calibration
    factors were utilized. The average molar mass of the measured samples is  M   =  27.976
    970 12(12) g mol<sup>−1</sup> with a relative combined uncertainty  u<sub>c,rel</sub>(
    M )  =  4.4 ×10<sup>−9</sup>. This value is in astounding agreement with the values
    of single samples measured and published by NIST, NMIJ, and PTB. With respect
    to the associated uncertainties, no significant variations in the molar mass and
    the isotopic composition as a function of the sample position in the boule were
    observed and thus could not be traced back to an inherent property of the crystal.
    This means that the crystal is not only ‘homogeneous’ with respect to molar mass
    but also has predominantly homogeneous distribution of the three stable Si isotopes.</p>
