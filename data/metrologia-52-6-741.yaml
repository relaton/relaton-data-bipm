abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>As methane is the major component of natural gas and non-conventional
    gases as biogas or mine gases, its energy content has to be measured accurately
    regardless of its production site for fiscal trading of transported and distributed
    natural gas. The determination of calorific value of fuel gases with the lowest
    uncertainty can only be performed by direct method with a reference gas calorimeter.
    To address this point, LNE developed a few years ago an isoperibolic reference
    gas calorimeter according to the Rossini’s principle. The energy content H<sub>s</sub>
    of methane of purity 99.9995% has been measured to 55 507.996 kJ kg<sup>−1</sup>
    (890.485 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) with an expanded relative uncertainty of 0.091%
    (coverage factor k  =  2.101 providing a level of confidence of approximately
    95%). These results are based on ten repeated measurements and on the uncertainty
    assessment performed in accordance with the guide to the expression of uncertainty
    in measurement (GUM). The experimental setup and the results are reported here
    and for the first time, the fully detailed uncertainty calculation is exposed.</p>
