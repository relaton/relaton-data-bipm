abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An interlaboratory comparison of small-current generation and
    measurement capability is presented with the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier
    (ULCA) acting as travelling standard. Various measurements at direct currents
    between 0.16 nA and 13 nA were performed to verify the degree of agreement between
    the three national metrology institutes involved in the study. Consistency well
    within one part per million (ppm) was found. Due to harsh environmental conditions
    during shipment, the ULCA’s transfer accuracy had been limited to about  ±0.4
    ppm. Supplemental measurements performed at PTB indicate that further improvements
    in accuracy are possible. Relative uncertainties of 0.1 ppm are achieved by applying
    on-site calibration of the ULCA with a suitable cryogenic current comparator.</p>
