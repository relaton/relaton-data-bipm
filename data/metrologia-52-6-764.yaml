abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the framework of the international key comparison CCAUV.U-K3.1,
    a data logger was used to monitor temperature, pressure, humidity, and acceleration
    during transportation of an artefact travelling between participating laboratories.
    From the recorded data, environmental conditions of different kinds of transportation
    have been investigated and corresponding recommendations for the safe and proper
    transfer of artefacts between laboratories could be deduced.</p><p>Transportation
    by courier services bears the risk of strong mechanical shocks and exposure to
    comparably high or low temperatures due to inappropriate handling or storage and
    is thus only suitable for insensitive or well-packed artefacts.</p><p>Quite low
    temperatures (T  ≈  5 °C) have been observed in the cargo area during flights,
    so that hand-carrying of an artefact with transportation in the passenger cabin
    during flights is recommended, particularly for temperature-sensitive artefacts.
    Significant decreases of the pressure (p  ≈  750 mbar) have been recorded both
    for transportation in the passenger cabin and in the cargo area. Air-tight packing
    is thus recommended for pressure-sensitive devices.</p><p>In general, the suitability
    of a data logger to provide evidence of the transport conditions during a key
    comparison has been demonstrated and the use of such a device is recommended for
    all key comparisons. The data logger has also been successfully employed to validate
    the protection properties of the passively insulating packaging of the artefact
    against pressure and temperature changes.</p>
