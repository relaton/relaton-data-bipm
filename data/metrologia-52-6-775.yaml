abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is developing
    a watt balance for the forthcoming redefinition of the kilogram. An improved version
    of the apparatus, based on a new closed magnetic circuit is now being assembled.
    The new apparatus will significantly reduce the type B uncertainty due to misalignment
    of the magnetic circuit as this work demonstrates. We present two techniques recently
    developed to accurately align the magnetic field of the circuit perpendicular
    to the direction defined by the local acceleration of gravity. Uncertainty below
    30 μrad was achieved for both techniques which fulfils the requirements for the
    BIPM watt balance to enable a Planck constant determination at the 1  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>
    level.</p>
