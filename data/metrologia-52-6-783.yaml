abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Photothermal radiometry (PTR) has become a popular method to
    measure thermal properties of layered materials. Much research has been done to
    determine the capabilities of PTR, but with little uncertainty analysis. This
    study reports a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to quantify uncertainty of film
    diffusivity and effusivity measurements, presents a sensitivity study for each
    input parameter, compares linear and logarithmic spacing of data points on frequency
    scans, and investigates the validity of a one-dimensional heat transfer assumption.
    Logarithmic spacing of frequencies when taking data is found to be unequivocally
    superior to linear spacing, while the use of a higher-dimensional heat transfer
    model is only needed for certain measurement configurations. The sensitivity analysis
    supports the frequency spacing conclusion, as well as explains trends seen in
    the uncertainty data.</p>
