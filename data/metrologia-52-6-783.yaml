    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Photothermal radiometry (PTR) has become a popular method to measure thermal properties of layered materials. Much research has been done to determine the capabilities of PTR, but with little uncertainty analysis. This study reports a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to quantify uncertainty of film diffusivity and effusivity measurements, presents a sensitivity study for each input parameter, compares linear and logarithmic spacing of data points on frequency scans, and investigates the validity of a one-dimensional heat transfer assumption. Logarithmic spacing of frequencies when taking data is found to be unequivocally superior to linear spacing, while the use of a higher-dimensional heat transfer model is only needed for certain measurement configurations. The sensitivity analysis supports the frequency spacing conclusion, as well as explains trends seen in the uncertainty data.</p>
