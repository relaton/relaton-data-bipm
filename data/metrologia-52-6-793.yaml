abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The self-attraction effect (SAE) in an absolute gravimeter is
    a kind of systematic error due to the gravitation of the instrument to the falling
    object. This effect depends on the mass distribution of the gravimeter, and is
    estimated to be a few microgals (1 μGal  =  10<sup>−8</sup> m s<sup>−2</sup>)
    for the FG5 gravimeter. In this paper, the SAE of a home-made T-1 absolute gravimeter
    is analyzed and calculated. Most of the stationary components, including the dropping
    chamber, the laser interferometer, the vibration isolation device and two tripods,
    are finely modelled, and the related SAEs are computed. In addition, the SAE of
    the co-falling carriage inside the dropping chamber is carefully calculated because
    the distance between the falling object and the co-falling carriage varies during
    the measurement. In order to get the correction of the SAE, two different methods
    are compared. One is to linearize the SAE curve, the other one is to calculate
    the perturbed trajectory. The results from these two methods agree with each other
    within 0.01 μGal. With an uncertainty analysis, the correction of the SAE of the
    T-1 gravimeter is estimated to be (−1.9  ±  0.1) μGal.</p>
