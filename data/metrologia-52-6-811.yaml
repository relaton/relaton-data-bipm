abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A problem that frequently occurs in metrology is the bias checking
    of data obtained by a laboratory against the specified value and uncertainty estimate
    given in the certificate of analysis. The measurand—a property of a certified
    reference material (CRM)—is supposed to be random with a normal distribution whose
    parameters are given by the certificate specifications. The laboratory’s data
    from subsequent measurements of the CRM (a CRM experiment) are summarized by the
    sample mean value and its uncertainty which is commonly based on a repeatability
    standard deviation. New confidence intervals for the lab’s bias are derived. Although
    they may lack intuitive appeal, those obtained by using higher order asymptotic
    methods, compared and contrasted in this paper, are recommended.</p>
