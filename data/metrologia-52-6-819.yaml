abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Variation in the isotopic composition of water is one of the
    major contributors to uncertainty in the realization of the triple point of water
    (TPW). Although the dependence of the TPW on the isotopic composition of the water
    has been known for years, there is still a lack of a detailed and accurate experimental
    determination of the values for the correction constants. This paper is the first
    of two articles (Part I and Part II) that address quantification of isotope abundance
    effects on the triple point temperature of water. In this paper, we describe our
    experimental assessment of the<sup>2</sup>H isotope effect. We manufactured five
    triple point cells with prepared water mixtures with a range of<sup>2</sup>H isotopic
    abundances encompassing widely the natural abundance range, while the<sup>18</sup>O
    and<sup>17</sup>O isotopic abundance were kept approximately constant and the<sup>18</sup>O  −  <sup>17</sup>O
    ratio was close to the Meijer–Li relationship for natural waters. The selected
    range of<sup>2</sup>H isotopic abundances led to cells that realised TPW temperatures
    between approximately  −140 μK to  +2500 μK with respect to the TPW temperature
    as realized by VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). Our experiment led to
    determination of the value for the δ<sup>2</sup>H correction parameter of A<sub>2H</sub>  =  673
    μK / (‰ deviation of δ<sup>2</sup>H from VSMOW) with a combined uncertainty of
    4 μK (k  =  1, or 1σ).</p>
