abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper is the second of two articles on the quantification
    of isotope effects on the triple point temperature of water. In this second article,
    we address the combined effects of<sup>18</sup>O and<sup>17</sup>O isotopes. We
    manufactured five triple point cells with waters with<sup>18</sup>O and<sup>17</sup>O
    abundances exceeding widely the natural abundance range while maintaining their
    natural<sup>18</sup>O/<sup>17</sup>O relationship. The<sup>2</sup>H isotopic abundance
    was kept close to that of VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). These cells
    realized triple point temperatures ranging between  −220 μK to 1420 μK with respect
    to the temperature realized by a triple point cell filled with VSMOW. Our experiment
    allowed us to determine an accurate and reliable value for the newly defined combined<sup>18,
    17</sup>O correction parameter of A<sub>O</sub>  =  630 μK with a combined uncertainty
    of 10 μK. To apply this correction, only the<sup>18</sup>O abundance of the TPW
    needs to be known (and the water needs to be of natural origin). Using the results
    of our two articles, we recommend a correction equation along with the coefficient
    values for isotopic compositions differing from that of VSMOW and compare the
    effect of this new equation on a number of triple point cells from the literature
    and from our own institute. Using our correction equation, the uncertainty in
    the isotope correction for triple point cell waters used around the world will
    be  &lt;1 μK.</p>
