abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We determine the free-convection effects and the resulting
    mass differences in a high-precision mass comparator for cylindrical and spherical
    1 kg mass standards at different air pressures. The temperature differences are
    chosen in the millikelvin range and lead to microgram updrafts. Our studies reveal
    a good agreement between the measurements and direct numerical simulations of
    the Boussinesq equations of free thermal convection. A higher sensitivity to the
    free convection effects is found for the spherical case compared to the cylindrical
    one. We also translate our results on the free convection effects into a form
    which is used in fluid mechanics: a dimensionless updraft coefficient as a function
    of the dimensionless Grashof number Gr that quantifies the thermal driving due
    to temperature differences. This relation displays a unique scaling behavior over
    nearly four decades in Gr and levels off into geometry-specific constants for
    the very small Grashof numbers. The obtained results provide a rational framework
    for estimating systematic errors in mass metrology due to the effects of free
    convection.</p>'
