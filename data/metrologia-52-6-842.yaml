abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In many of the high-precision optical frequency standards with
    trapped atoms or ions that are under development to date, the ac Stark shift induced
    by thermal radiation leads to a major contribution to the systematic uncertainty.
    We present an analysis of the inhomogeneous thermal environment experienced by
    ions in various types of ion traps. Finite element models which allow the determination
    of the temperature of the trap structure and the temperature of the radiation
    were developed for five ion trap designs, including operational traps at PTB and
    NPL and further optimized designs. Models were refined based on comparison with
    infrared camera measurement until an agreement of better than 10% of the measured
    temperature rise at critical test points was reached. The effective temperature
    rises of the radiation seen by the ion range from 0.8 K to 2.1 K at standard working
    conditions. The corresponding fractional frequency shift uncertainties resulting
    from the uncertainty in temperature are in the 10<sup>−18</sup> range for optical
    clocks based on the Sr<sup>+</sup> and Yb<sup>+</sup> E2 transitions, and even
    lower for Yb<sup>+</sup> E3, In<sup>+</sup> and Al<sup>+</sup>. Issues critical
    for heating of the trap structure and its predictability were identified and design
    recommendations developed.</p>
