    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper deals with heat exchange effects in a compact, high-speed, clearance-sealed version of a piston prover for gas flow measurements that has the temperature measurements limited to the time-averaged temperature of the gas flow. A lumped-element mathematical model is used to study the physical background of the heat exchange effects. Experimental testing is performed to validate the theoretical results, estimate the required temperature homogeneity in the piston prover and propose a modified measurement model that considers the heat exchange effects. These effects are almost linearly related to the temperature difference between the gas flow into the piston prover and the cylinder wall, with the sensitivity coefficient being dependent on the measured flow rate. The piston-prover configuration with the gas temperature sensor in the mixed inlet /outlet flow is found to be advantageous in comparison to a measurement of the inlet temperature.</p>
