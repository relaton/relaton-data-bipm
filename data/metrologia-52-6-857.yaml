abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper deals with heat exchange effects in a compact, high-speed,
    clearance-sealed version of a piston prover for gas flow measurements that has
    the temperature measurements limited to the time-averaged temperature of the gas
    flow. A lumped-element mathematical model is used to study the physical background
    of the heat exchange effects. Experimental testing is performed to validate the
    theoretical results, estimate the required temperature homogeneity in the piston
    prover and propose a modified measurement model that considers the heat exchange
    effects. These effects are almost linearly related to the temperature difference
    between the gas flow into the piston prover and the cylinder wall, with the sensitivity
    coefficient being dependent on the measured flow rate. The piston-prover configuration
    with the gas temperature sensor in the mixed inlet /outlet flow is found to be
    advantageous in comparison to a measurement of the inlet temperature.</p>
