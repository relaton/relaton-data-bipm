abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we propose a new clock steering method, which
    uses a third-order type 3 digital phase locked loop (DPLL) which is equivalent
    to a Kalman filter with a delay. A general overview of the theoretical framework
    is described in detail including the transfer functions, the structure and control
    values, the specifications, and the approach to choosing a parameter. Simulations
    show that the performance of the time and frequency steering errors and the frequency
    stability are quite desirable. Comparing with traditional clock steering methods,
    it is easier to work with just one parameter. The DPLL method satisfies the requirements
    of generating a local representation of universal time coordinated and the system
    time of a global navigation satellite system.</p>
