    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this paper we propose a new clock steering method, which uses a third-order type 3 digital phase locked loop (DPLL) which is equivalent to a Kalman filter with a delay. A general overview of the theoretical framework is described in detail including the transfer functions, the structure and control values, the specifications, and the approach to choosing a parameter. Simulations show that the performance of the time and frequency steering errors and the frequency stability are quite desirable. Comparing with traditional clock steering methods, it is easier to work with just one parameter. The DPLL method satisfies the requirements of generating a local representation of universal time coordinated and the system time of a global navigation satellite system.</p>
