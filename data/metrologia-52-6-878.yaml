abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Regression is a common task in metrology and often applied to
    calibrate instruments, evaluate inter-laboratory comparisons or determine fundamental
    constants, for example. Yet, a regression model cannot be uniquely formulated
    as a measurement function, and consequently the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement (GUM) and its supplements are not applicable directly. Bayesian
    inference, however, is well suited to regression tasks, and has the advantage
    of accounting for additional a priori information, which typically robustifies
    analyses. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future revisions of the GUM shall
    also embrace the Bayesian view.</p><p>Guidance on Bayesian inference for regression
    tasks is largely lacking in metrology. For linear regression models with Gaussian
    measurement errors this tutorial gives explicit guidance. Divided into three steps,
    the tutorial first illustrates how a priori knowledge, which is available from
    previous experiments, can be translated into prior distributions from a specific
    class. These prior distributions have the advantage of yielding analytical, closed
    form results, thus avoiding the need to apply numerical methods such as Markov
    Chain Monte Carlo. Secondly, formulas for the posterior results are given, explained
    and illustrated, and software implementations are provided. In the third step,
    Bayesian tools are used to assess the assumptions behind the suggested approach.</p><p>These
    three steps (prior elicitation, posterior calculation, and robustness to prior
    uncertainty and model adequacy) are critical to Bayesian inference. The general
    guidance given here for Normal linear regression tasks is accompanied by a simple,
    but real-world, metrological example. The calibration of a flow device serves
    as a running example and illustrates the three steps. It is shown that prior knowledge
    from previous calibrations of the same sonic nozzle enables robust predictions
    even for extrapolations.</p>
