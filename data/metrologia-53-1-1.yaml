abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An approach to achieve absolute planarity characterization of
    an x-ray mirror through an interferometric method is presented. With three measurements
    and two nominally flat auxiliary mirrors, the radius of curvature and the slope
    profile of a nominally flat x-ray mirror are retrieved. The height profile is
    then calculated through integration of the slope profile and merging this information
    with the radius of curvature knowledge. The method is explained in detail and
    a measurement example is provided. A comparison with a state-of-the-art deflectometric
    method is shown, with an agreement level of about 0.14 nm rms.</p>
