    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The International Committee for Weights and Measures has projected a major revision of the International System of Units in which all the base units will be defined by fixing the values of certain fundamental constants of nature. To assist, de Podesta <italic>et al</italic> recently experimentally obtained a precise new estimate of the Boltzmann constant. This estimate is proposed as a basis for the redefinition of the unit of temperature, the kelvin. The present paper reports a reanalysis of de Podesta <italic>et al</italic>’s data that reveals systematic non-random patterns in the residuals of the key fitted model equation. These patterns violate the assumptions underlying the analysis and thus they raise questions about the validity of de Podesta <italic>et al</italic>’s estimate of the Boltzmann constant. An approach is discussed to address these issues, which should lead to an accurate estimate of the Boltzmann constant with a lower uncertainty.</p>
