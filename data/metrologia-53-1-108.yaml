abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International Committee for Weights and Measures has projected
    a major revision of the International System of Units in which all the base units
    will be defined by fixing the values of certain fundamental constants of nature.
    To assist, de Podesta et al recently experimentally obtained a precise new estimate
    of the Boltzmann constant. This estimate is proposed as a basis for the redefinition
    of the unit of temperature, the kelvin. The present paper reports a reanalysis
    of de Podesta et al’s data that reveals systematic non-random patterns in the
    residuals of the key fitted model equation. These patterns violate the assumptions
    underlying the analysis and thus they raise questions about the validity of de
    Podesta et al’s estimate of the Boltzmann constant. An approach is discussed to
    address these issues, which should lead to an accurate estimate of the Boltzmann
    constant with a lower uncertainty.</p>
