abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We are reporting on analysis, design, construction, and key
    parameters of the device for a two-way time transfer via an optical fiber. The
    dominant source of errors in the two-way optical time transfer (TWOTT) via relatively
    short optical fibers is the temperature dependence of internal delays within the
    terminal units. We have performed an analysis of the influence of the internal
    delays and their temperature dependence on the TWOTT process considering two different
    configurations of the terminals with the feedback coupling in optical and electrical
    domains. The achieved results have been used for the optimal design of a TWOTT
    system implementing standard small form-factor pluggable optical transceivers.
    The operational tests of this new TWOTT system confirmed the precision of the
    time transfer on the subpicosecond level, the time transfer stability characterized
    by TDEV better than 60 fs for averaging intervals from 100 s to 10 000 s, and
    the temperature stability better than 100 fs K<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
