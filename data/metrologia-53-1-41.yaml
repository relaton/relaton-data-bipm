abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This article reports on the evaluation of an uncertainty budget
    associated with the measurement of the mean diameter of a nanoparticle (NP) population
    by Atomic Force Microscopy. The measurement principle consists in measuring the
    height of a spherical-like NP population to determine the mean diameter and the
    size distribution. This method assumes that the NPs are well-dispersed on the
    substrate and isolated enough to avoid measurement errors due to agglomeration
    phenomenon. Since the measurement is directly impacted by the substrate roughness,
    the NPs have been deposited on a mica sheet presenting a very low roughness. A
    complete metrological characterization of the instrument has been carried out
    and the main error sources have been evaluated. The measuring method has been
    tested on a population of SiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. Homemade software has been used
    to build the height distribution histogram taking into account only isolated NP.</p><p>Finally,
    the uncertainty budget including main components has been established for the
    mean diameter measurement of this NP population. The most important components
    of this uncertainty budget are the calibration process along Z-axis, the scanning
    speed influence and then the vertical noise level.</p>
