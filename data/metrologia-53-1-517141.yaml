abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Water in its three ambient phases plays the central thermodynamic
    role in the terrestrial climate system. Clouds control Earth’s radiation balance,
    atmospheric water vapour is the strongest ‘greenhouse’ gas, and non-equilibrium
    relative humidity at the air–sea interface drives evaporation and latent heat
    export from the ocean. On climatic time scales, melting ice caps and regional
    deviations of the hydrological cycle result in changes of seawater salinity, which
    in turn may modify the global circulation of the oceans and their ability to store
    heat and to buffer anthropogenically produced carbon dioxide. In this paper, together
    with three companion articles, we examine the climatologically relevant quantities
    ocean salinity, seawater pH and atmospheric relative humidity, noting fundamental
    deficiencies in the definitions of those key observables, and their lack of secure
    foundation on the International System of Units, the SI. The metrological histories
    of those three quantities are reviewed, problems with their current definitions
    and measurement practices are analysed, and options for future improvements are
    discussed in conjunction with the recent seawater standard TEOS-10. It is concluded
    that the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM, in cooperation with
    the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, IAPWS, along
    with other international organizations and institutions, can make significant
    contributions by developing and recommending state-of-the-art solutions for these
    long standing metrological problems in climatology.</p>
