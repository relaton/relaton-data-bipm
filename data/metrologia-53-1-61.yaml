abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A numerical and geometrical model for calculating the local
    effective emissivity of isothermal blackbody cylinder-conical cavities with lid,
    assuming diffuse reflection, is described. This has been developed by generalizing
    previous models based on conical and cylindrical geometries. The model has been
    validated by determining the diffusely reflected photon trajectories and the corresponding
    experimental view factors between given pairs of surface elements. Differences
    compared to theoretical values, were subsequently analyzed in terms of the model’s
    intrinsic uncertainty. A well-defined numerical function that calculates the effective
    emissivity as a function of its natural variables, intrinsic emissivity and geometrical
    parameters, is established.</p><p>In order to calculate the probability distribution
    of the output quantity, we use the Monte Carlo method for the propagation of the
    probability distributions that characterize our knowledge concerning the values
    of the influence variables.</p><p>The model is applied to heat-pipe black bodies
    installed at our laboratory, previously characterized at the PTB. A comparison
    with published uncertainty results, obtained by applying classical uncertainty
    propagation techniques, is also made.</p>
