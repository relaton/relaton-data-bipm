abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The knowledge of atomic fundamental parameters such as mass
    attenuation coefficients with low uncertainties, is of decisive importance in
    elemental quantification using x-ray fluorescence analysis techniques. Several
    databases are accessible and frequently used within a large community of users.
    These compilations are most often in good agreement for photon energies in the
    hard x-ray ranges. However, they significantly differ for low photon energies
    and around the absorption edges of any element. In a joint cooperation of the
    metrology institutes of France and Germany, mass attenuation coefficients of copper
    and zinc were determined experimentally in the photon energy range from 100 eV
    to 30 keV by independent approaches using monochromatized synchrotron radiation
    at SOLEIL (France) and BESSY II (Germany), respectively. The application of high-accuracy
    experimental techniques resulted in mass attenuation coefficient datasets determined
    with low uncertainties that are directly compared to existing databases. The novel
    datasets are expected to enhance the reliability of mass attenuation coefficients.</p>
