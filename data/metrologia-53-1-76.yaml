abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a light emitting diode (LED)-based system utilizing
    a combinatorial flux addition method to investigate the non-linear relationship
    in solar cells between the output current of the cell and the incident irradiance
    level. The magnitude of the light flux is controlled by the supplied currents
    to two LEDs (or two sets of them) in a combinatorial fashion. The signals measured
    from the cell are arranged within a related overdetermined linear system of equations
    derived from an appropriately chosen Nth degree polynomial representing the relationship
    between the measured signals and the incident fluxes. The flux values and the
    polynomial coefficients are then solved for by linear least squares to obtain
    the best fit. The technique can be applied to any solar cell, under either monochromatic
    or broadband spectrum. For the unscaled solution, no reference detectors or prior
    calibrations of the light flux are required. However, if at least one calibrated
    irradiance value is known, then the entire curve can be scaled to an appropriate
    spectral responsivity value. Using this technique, a large number of data points
    can be obtained in a relatively short time scale over a large signal range.</p>
