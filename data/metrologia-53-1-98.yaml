abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A room-temperature calorimeter was developed for the absolute
    laser power measurement of x-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) at the SPring-8
    Angstrom Compact free electron LAser facility in Japan. In the photon energy range
    from 4.5 keV to 15 keV, this calorimeter was demonstrated to accurately measure
    laser powers of XFEL up to 6.9 mW. In addition, an online beam monitor, based
    on the detection of backscattered x-rays from a thin diamond film, was calibrated
    with the room-temperature calorimeter. The calibration results were compared with
    those obtained previously with a cryogenic radiometer (the primary standard detector
    for synchrotron radiations in Japan). The calibration results obtained with the
    two detectors agreed well within 1.2%, which is well below their combined relative
    standard uncertainty. Moreover, the spectral responsivity of the beam monitor
    was found to show a strong photon energy dependence owing to Debyeâ€“Scherrer diffraction
    patterns from the thin-film.</p>
