abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Regression is an important task in metrology and least-squares
    methods are often applied in this context. Bayesian inference provides an alternative
    that can take into account available prior knowledge. We illustrate similarities
    and differences of the two approaches in terms of a particular nonlinear regression
    problem. The impact of prior knowledge utilized in the Bayesian regression depends
    on the amount of information contained in the data, and by considering data sets
    with different signal-to-noise ratios the relevance of the employed prior knowledge
    for the results is investigated. In addition, properties of the two approaches
    are explored in the context of the particular example.</p>
