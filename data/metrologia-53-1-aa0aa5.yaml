abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The current guidelines for the evaluation and expression of
    the uncertainty of NIST measurement results were originally published in 1993
    as NIST Technical Note 1297, which was last revised in 1994. NIST is now updating
    its principles and procedures for uncertainty evaluation to address current and
    emerging needs in measurement science that Technical Note 1297 could not have
    anticipated or contemplated when it was first conceived. Although progressive
    and forward-looking, this update is also conservative because it does not require
    that current practices for uncertainty evaluation be abandoned or modified where
    they are fit for purpose and when there is no compelling reason to do otherwise.
    The updated guidelines are offered as a  Simple Guide  intended to be deployed
    under the NIST policy on Measurement Quality, and are accompanied by a rich collection
    of examples of application drawn from many different fields of measurement science.</p>
