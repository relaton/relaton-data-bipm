abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The joule balance experiment has been carried out at the National
    Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) since 2007. By the end of 2013 the first generation
    of the joule balance (NIM-1) achieved a measurement uncertainty of 7.2  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>
    (k  =  1). To reduce the measurement uncertainty further, the next generation
    of the joule balance apparatus (NIM-2) system is under construction. A new coil
    system using ferromagnetic material is being adopted in NIM-2 to reduce self-heating
    in the coils. However, the effects on the measurement of the mutual inductance
    from the nonlinearity and hysteresis of the ferromagnetic material will bring
    a considerable measurement uncertainty. Inspired by the watt balance, the measurement
    of the mutual inductance is replaced by an equivalent measurement of the magnetic
    flux linkage difference. The nonlinearity and hysteresis will not be a problem
    in the measurement of the magnetic flux linkage difference. This technique comes
    from the watt balance method. It is called the generalized joule balance method,
    which is actually a modification of the watt balance method. However, it still
    represents a valid change that can reduce the difficulty of dynamic measurement
    experienced using the watt balance. Permanent magnets can also be adopted in the
    generalized joule balance. To check the feasibility of the generalized joule balance
    method, some preliminary experiments have been performed on NIM-1. A yokeless
    permanent magnet system has been designed and used to replace the exciting coils
    in NIM-1. In this paper, the structure of the yokeless permanent magnet system
    is introduced. Furthermore, a determination of the Planck constant with the permanent
    magnet system is presented. The value of the Planck constant h we obtained is
    6.626 069(17)  ×  10<sup>−34</sup> J s with a relative standard uncertainty of
    2.6  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
