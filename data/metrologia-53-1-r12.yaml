abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Salinity is a key variable in the modelling and observation
    of ocean circulation and ocean-atmosphere fluxes of heat and water. In this paper,
    we examine the climatological relevance of ocean salinity, noting fundamental
    deficiencies in the definition of this key observable, and its lack of a secure
    foundation in the International System of Units, the SI. The metrological history
    of salinity is reviewed, problems with its current definitions and measurement
    practices are analysed, and options for future improvements are discussed in conjunction
    with the recent seawater standard TEOS-10.</p>
