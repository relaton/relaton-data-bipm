abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Water dissolves many substances with which it comes into contact,
    leading to a variety of aqueous solutions ranging from simple and dilute to complex
    and highly concentrated. Of the multiple chemical species present in these solutions,
    the hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>, stands out in importance due to its relevance
    to a variety of chemical reactions and equilibria that take place in aquatic systems.
    This importance, and the fact that its presence can be assessed by reliable and
    inexpensive procedures, are the reasons why pH is perhaps the most measured chemical
    parameter. In this paper, while examining climatologically relevant ocean pH,
    we note fundamental problems in the definition of this key observable, and its
    lack of secure foundation on the International System of Units, the SI. The metrological
    history of seawater pH is reviewed, difficulties arising from its current definition
    and measurement practices are analysed, and options for future improvements are
    discussed in conjunction with the recent TEOS-10 seawater standard. It is concluded
    that the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), in cooperation with
    the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS), along
    with other international organisations and institutions, can make significant
    contributions by developing and recommending state-of-the-art solutions for these
    long standing metrological problems.</p>
