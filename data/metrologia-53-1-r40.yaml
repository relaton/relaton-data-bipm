abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Water in its three ambient phases plays the central thermodynamic
    role in the terrestrial climate system. Clouds control Earth’s radiation balance,
    atmospheric water vapour is the strongest ‘greenhouse’ gas, and non-equilibrium
    relative humidity at the air–sea interface drives evaporation and latent heat
    export from the ocean. In this paper, we examine the climatologically relevant
    atmospheric relative humidity, noting fundamental deficiencies in the definition
    of this key observable. The metrological history of this quantity is reviewed,
    problems with its current definition and measurement practice are analysed, and
    options for future improvements are discussed in conjunction with the recent seawater
    standard TEOS-10. It is concluded that the International Bureau of Weights and
    Measures (BIPM), in cooperation with the International Association for the Properties
    of Water and Steam (IAPWS), along with other international organizations and institutions,
    can make significant contributions by developing and recommending state-of-the-art
    solutions, such as are suggested here, for what are long-standing metrological
    problems.</p>
