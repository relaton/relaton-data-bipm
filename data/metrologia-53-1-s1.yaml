abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The determination of thermal diffusivity is at the heart of
    modern materials characterisation. The evaluation of the associated uncertainty
    is difficult because the determination is performed in an indirect way, in the
    sense that the thermal diffusivity cannot be measured directly. The well-known
    GUM uncertainty framework does not provide a reliable evaluation of measurement
    uncertainty for such inverse problems, because in that framework the underlying
    measurement model is supposed to be a direct relationship between the measurand
    (the quantity intended to be measured) and the input quantities on which the measurand
    depends. This paper is concerned with the development of a Bayesian approach to
    evaluate the measurement uncertainty associated with thermal diffusivity. A Bayesian
    model is first developed for a single thermogram and is then extended to the case
    of several thermograms obtained under repeatability and reproducibility conditions.
    This multi-thermogram based model is able to take into consideration a large set
    of influencing quantities that occur during the measurements and yields a more
    reliable uncertainty evaluation than the one obtained from a single thermogram.
    Different aspects of the Bayesian model are discussed, including the sensitivity
    to the choice of the prior distribution, the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm used
    for the inference and the convergence of the Markov chains.</p>
