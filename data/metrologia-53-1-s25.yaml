    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper reviews a selection of topics related to the evaluation and expression of measurement uncertainty in complex quantities, which are prevalent in electromagnetic measurements at radio and microwave frequencies. Methods appropriate for complex quantities are presented that extend those described, for real-valued quantities, in the <italic>Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement</italic>.</p>
