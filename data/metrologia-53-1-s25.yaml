- content: Abstract<p>This paper reviews a selection of topics related to the evaluation
    and expression of measurement uncertainty in complex quantities, which are prevalent
    in electromagnetic measurements at radio and microwave frequencies. Methods appropriate
    for complex quantities are presented that extend those described, for real-valued
    quantities, in the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.</p>
