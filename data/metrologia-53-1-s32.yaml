abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement
    (GUM) and methods from its supplements are not applicable, the Bayesian approach
    may be a valid and welcome alternative. Evaluating the posterior distribution,
    estimates or uncertainties involved in Bayesian inferences often requires numerical
    methods to avoid high-dimensional integrations. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    sampling is such a method—powerful, flexible and widely applied. Here, a concise
    introduction is given, illustrated by a simple, typical example from metrology.</p><p>The
    Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is the most basic and yet flexible MCMC method.
    Its underlying concepts are explained and the algorithm is given step by step.
    The few lines of software code required for its implementation invite interested
    readers to get started. Diagnostics to evaluate the performance and common algorithmic
    choices are illustrated to calibrate the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm for efficiency.
    Routine application of MCMC algorithms may be hindered currently by the difficulty
    to assess the convergence of MCMC output and thus to assure the validity of results.
    An example points to the importance of convergence and initiates discussion about
    advantages as well as areas of research. Available software tools are mentioned
    throughout.</p>
