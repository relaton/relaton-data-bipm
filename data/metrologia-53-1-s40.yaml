abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An inter-laboratory experiment for the evaluation of toxic effects
    of NH<sub>2</sub>-polystyrene nanoparticles on living human cancer cells was performed
    with five participating laboratories. Previously published results from nanocytoxicity
    assays are often contradictory, mostly due to challenges related to producing
    a reliable cytotoxicity assay protocol for use with nanomaterials. Specific challenges
    include reproducibility preparing nanoparticle dispersions, biological variability
    from testing living cell lines, and the potential for nano-related interference
    effects. In this experiment, such challenges were addressed by developing a detailed
    experimental protocol and using a specially designed 96-well plate layout which
    incorporated a range of control measurements to assess multiple factors such as
    nanomaterial interference, pipetting accuracy, cell seeding density, and instrument
    performance. Detailed data analysis of these control measurements showed that
    good control of the experiments was attained by all participants in most cases.
    The main measurement objective of the study was the estimation of a dose response
    relationship between concentration of the nanoparticles and metabolic activity
    of the living cells, under several experimental conditions. The dose curve estimation
    was achieved by imbedding a three parameter logistic curve in a three level Bayesian
    hierarchical model, accounting for uncertainty due to all known experimental conditions
    as well as between laboratory variability in a top-down manner. Computation was
    performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. The fit of the model was evaluated
    using Bayesian posterior predictive probabilities and found to be satisfactory.</p>
