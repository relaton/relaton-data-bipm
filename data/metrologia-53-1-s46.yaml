abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Combining multiple measurement results for the same quantity
    is an important task in metrology and in many other areas. Examples include the
    determination of fundamental constants, the calculation of reference values in
    interlaboratory comparisons, or the meta-analysis of clinical studies. However,
    neither the GUM nor its supplements give any guidance for this task. Various approaches
    are applied such as weighted least-squares in conjunction with the Birge ratio
    or random effects models. While the former approach, which is based on a location-scale
    model, is particularly popular in metrology, the latter represents a standard
    tool used in statistics for meta-analysis. We investigate the reliability and
    robustness of the location-scale model and the random effects model with particular
    focus on resulting coverage or credible intervals. The interval estimates are
    obtained by adopting a Bayesian point of view in conjunction with a non-informative
    prior that is determined by a currently favored principle for selecting non-informative
    priors. Both approaches are compared by applying them to simulated data as well
    as to data for the Planck constant and the Newtonian constant of gravitation.
    Our results suggest that the proposed Bayesian inference based on the random effects
    model is more reliable and less sensitive to model misspecifications than the
    approach based on the location-scale model.</p>
