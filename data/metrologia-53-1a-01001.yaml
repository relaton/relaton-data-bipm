    <p>This report summarises the results of the Key Comparison CCEM.RF-K22.W on noise temperature, performed between October 2007 and February 2011. In this comparison, the available noise temperature of three noise sources was determined by six National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) in the frequency range from 18 GHz to 26.5 GHz.</p>
