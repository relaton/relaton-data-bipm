    <p></p><p>A comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the Directorate of Measures and Precious Metals (DMDM), Belgrade, Serbia, was carried out in June 2015 at the level of 10 V. For this exercise, options A and B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol were applied. Option B required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the DMDM using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. Option A required the DMDM to provide a reference voltage with its Josephson voltage standard for measurement by the BIPM using an analogue nanovoltmeter and associated measurement loop. Since no sufficiently stable voltage could be achieved in this configuration, a digital detector was used. In all cases the BIPM array was kept floating from ground.</p><p>The final results were in good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 1.5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
