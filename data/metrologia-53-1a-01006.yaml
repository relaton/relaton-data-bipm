    <p>A comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards of the <italic toggle="yes">Bureau International des Poids et Mesures</italic> (BIPM) and the <italic toggle="yes">National Institute of Metrology</italic> - (Thailand), NIMT, was carried out in November 2015 at the level of 10 V. For this exercise, options A and B of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol were applied. Option B required the BIPM to provide a reference voltage for measurement by the NIMT using its Josephson standard with its own measuring device. Option A required the NIMT to provide a reference voltage with its Josephson voltage standard for measurement by the BIPM using an <italic toggle="yes">analogue</italic> nanovoltmeter and associated measurement loop. In all cases the BIPM array was kept floating from ground.</p>
    <p>The final results were in good agreement within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.6 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p>
