abstract:
- content: "<p></p><p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.b, a
    comparison of the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National
    Standards Authority of Ireland - National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI - NML), Dublin,
    Ireland, was carried out in January and February 2016. Two BIPM Zener diode-based
    travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_7 (Z7) and BIPM_9 (Z9), were transported
    by freight to NSAI-NML. At NSAI-NML, the reference standard for DC voltage at
    the 10 V level consists of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic
    voltage standards. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard
    was measured by direct comparison with the group standard.</p><p>At the BIPM the
    travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at NSAI-NML,
    with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected
    for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature
    and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p><p>The final result of the comparison is
    presented as the difference between the values assigned to DC voltage standards
    by NSAI - NML, at the level of 10 V, at NSAI - NML, U<sub>NML</sub>, and those
    assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of
    the 31 of January 2016.</p><p>\n U<sub>NML</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = + 0.22 μV;
    \tu<sub>c</sub> = 1.35 μV, at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard
    uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty
    of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at NSAI-NML, based on K<sub>J-90</sub>,
    and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>Main text</p><p>\nTo reach
    the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
