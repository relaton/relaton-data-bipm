  content: "<p></p>\n<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.b,
    a comparison of the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National
    Standards Authority of Ireland - National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI - NML), Dublin,
    Ireland, was carried out in January and February 2016. Two BIPM Zener diode-based
    travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_7 (Z7) and BIPM_9 (Z9), were transported
    by freight to NSAI-NML. At NSAI-NML, the reference standard for DC voltage at
    the 10 V level consists of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic
    voltage standards. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard
    was measured by direct comparison with the group standard.</p>\n<p>At the BIPM
    the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at
    NSAI-NML, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were
    corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on
    internal temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>\n<p>The final result
    of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned to
    DC voltage standards by NSAI - NML, at the level of 10 V, at NSAI - NML, <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n               <sub>NML</sub>, and those assigned by
    the BIPM, at the BIPM, <italic toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n               <sub>BIPM</sub>,
    at the reference date of the 31 of January 2016.</p>\n<p>\n               <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n               <sub>NML</sub> - <italic toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n
    \              <sub>BIPM</sub> = + 0.22 μV; \t<italic toggle=\"yes\">u</italic>\n
    \              <sub>c</sub> = 1.35 μV   , at 10 V</p>\n<p>where <italic toggle=\"yes\">u</italic>\n
    \              <sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated with
    the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the
    volt at the BIPM and at NSAI-NML, based on K<sub>J-90</sub>, and the uncertainty
    related to the comparison.</p>\n<p><bold>Main text</bold></p>\n<p>\nTo reach the
