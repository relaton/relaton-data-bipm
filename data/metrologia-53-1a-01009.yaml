    <p>An inter-comparison of 10 mH and 100 mH inductance standards has taken place within the framework of COOMET. The inter-comparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'-UMTS (Ukraine), has involved four laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization - EURAMET (GUM, Poland). The results presented in this report show that there are significant differences between some laboratory representations of the henry. However, the agreement demonstrated by the inter-comparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for the henry.</p>
