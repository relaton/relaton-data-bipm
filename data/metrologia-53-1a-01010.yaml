    <p></p><p>The first key comparison in microwave frequencies within the SIM (Sistema Interamericano de Metrología) region has been carried out. The measurands were the S-parameters of 50 ohm coaxial devices with Type-N connectors and were measured at 2 GHz, 9 GHz and 18 GHz. SIM.EM.RF-K5b.CL was the identification assigned and it was based on a parent CCEM key comparison named CCEM.RF-K5b.CL. For this reason, the measurements standards and their nominal values were selected accordingly, i.e. two one-port devices (a matched and a mismatched load) to cover low and high reflection coefficients and two attenuators (3dB and 20 dB) to cover low and high transmission coefficients. This key comparison has met the need for ensuring traceability in high-frequency measurements across America by linking SIM's results to CCEM. Six NMIs have participated in this comparison which was piloted by the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Industrial (Argentina). A linking method of multivariate values was proposed and implemented in order to allow the linking of 2-dimensional results.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p></p><p> Main text</p><p>
