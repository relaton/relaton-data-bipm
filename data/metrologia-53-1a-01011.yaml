    <p></p><p>An intercomparison of AC/DC voltage transfer references has taken place within the framework of COOMET. The intercomparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'-UMTS (Ukraine), has involved five laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization-EURAMET (INM, Romania). The results presented in this report appear to show that there are significant differences between some laboratories' representations of the volt. However, the agreement demonstrated by the intercomparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for the AC/DC voltage transfer references. Proposed to link the results from this key comparison to the CCEM-K6.a comparison. VNIIM (Russia) is linking NMI as far as they participated in CCEM-K6.a.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
