    <p></p><p>The Supplementary Comparison COOMET.PR-S3 was carried out to ensure the correctness and comparability of refractive index of solid transparent materials in visible spectral range measured by the participants of the comparison within the uncertainties claimed for their measuring facility. COOMET.PR-S3 was conducted within the Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) "Euro-Asian Cooperation of National Metrological Institutions" known as COOMET, and has the RMO project number of 438/RU/08.</p><p>The Comparison was piloted by the All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI). Five NMIs from three RMOs (COOMET, EURAMET and APMP) participated in the comparison.</p><p>This report describes the measurement results of three prismatic samples made of different types of glass. Three participants, VNIIOFI, PTB and Ukrmetrteststandart have made measurements of the refractive index at the wavelengths of 480 nm, 509 nm, 546 nm, 589.3 nm, 644 nm, and three participants, VNIIOFI, INRiM and AIST at the wavelength of 632.8 nm.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
