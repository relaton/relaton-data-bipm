    <p>In compliance with the established BIPM and CCPR policies and guidelines on comparisons, the SIM Photometry and Radiometry Working Group decided to conduct a key comparison on total luminous flux in order to provide an opportunity for its member National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) that did not participate in the CCPR-K4 comparison, to get a link to the reference value obtained for this quantity (the lumen) and to derive the corresponding degrees of equivalence.</p>
    <p>This SIM.PR-K4 was piloted by Centro Nacional de Metrología (CENAM), the NMI of Mexico and included the participation of five laboratories: CENAM (Mexico), INTI (Argentina), INMETRO (Brazil), NIST (USA, linking lab), and NRC (Canada, linking lab).</p>
    <p>The comparison, conducted in star type scheme, was run using three to four lamps per participant, and results are given in this report, including the unilateral degrees of equivalence.</p>
