    <p></p><p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison between NPL and UME, which was carried out to establish the unilateral degrees of equivalence for UME with respect to the defined reference value of the CCPR S3 supplementary comparison of cryogenic radiometers using silicon trap detectors as transfer devices. In accordance with the protocol for the CCPR S3 comparison, UME was asked to calibrate a set of NPL supplied silicon trap transfer detectors at a series of laser wavelengths; UME chose to measure at 514.5 nm and 632.8 nm.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
