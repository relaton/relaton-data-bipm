    <p>A supplementary comparison of gas high-pressure standards was conducted between the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP), in order to determine their degrees of equivalence in the pressure range from 10 MPa to 100 MPa in gauge mode. The pilot institute was NMIJ/AIST. The measurements were carried out from July 2014 to October 2014. Both participating institutes used pressure balances as their pressure standards. Different gases were used for the pressure medium: NMIJ/AIST used Nitrogen, while NIST used Helium. A set of two pressure monitors was used as the transfer standard. The pressure monitors were found sufficiently stable during the measurements. Characteristics of the pressure monitors were evaluated at the pilot institute, and then used for data corrections and uncertainty estimations. In particular, the effect of the gas medium on the pressure monitors was found to be significant, and then all the measurement data were corrected to those with Nitrogen. The degrees of equivalence between the two institutes were evaluated by the relative differences of the participant's results and their associated expanded (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) uncertainties. The gas pressure standards in the range 10 MPa to 100 MPa for gauge mode of the two participating institutes were found to be equivalent within their claimed uncertainties.</p>
