    <p></p><p>APMP.T-K7, was held from February 2008 to September 2009 to compare the national realizations of the water triple point among eleven NMIs. To reach the objective, each participating laboratory sent a transfer cell to CMS and stated a value for the temperature difference of the transfer cell, relative to the corresponding national standard, representing 273.16 K.</p><p>CMS (Taiwan) organized the comparison, with the support from co-pilot institutes MSL (New Zealand) and NMIJ (Japan). The other eight participating laboratories included NMIA, SCL, KIM-LIPI, KRISS, NMIM/SIRIM, NMC, NMISA, and NIMT.</p><p>This report presents the results of the TPW comparison, gives detailed information about the measurements made at the CMS and at the participating laboratories, and aims to link the results of APMP.T-K7 to CCT-K7. The results of this key comparison are also represented in the form of degrees of equivalence for the purposes of the MRA.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
