    <p></p><p>The APMP bilateral key comparison APMP.T-K3.4 was initiated on the request from RCM-LIPI (Indonesia) to link their national standards to the average reference values (ARVs) of the CCT-K3. Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS, Republic of Korea) provided the linkage to the CCT-K3 for temperatures ranging from -38.8344 °C to 419.527 °C. In the APMP.T-K3.4, two standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs) were chosen as the transfer instruments and were calibrated at the ITS-90 fixed-points in the comparison range. The fixed-points in this comparison included Zn freezing point (419.527 °C), Sn freezing point (231.928 °C), In freezing point (156.5985 °C), Ga melting point (29.7646 °C), and Hg triple point (-38.8344 °C). The comparison was carried out in a participant-pilot-participant sequence where KRISS served as the pilot. The linkage was based on the fixed-point resistance ratios of RCM-LIPI relative to the ARVs of the CCT-K3 via the difference between the fixed-point resistance ratios of KRISS and the ARVs of the CCT-K3. The temperature differences between the national standards of RCM-LIPI and the ARVs of the CCT-K3 were within the evaluated comparison uncertainties of the ATPM.T-K3.4. This report provides detailed information on the comparison results, linkage mechanism, and the Degree of Equivalence of the RCM-LIPI relative to the institutes having participated in the CCT-K3.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
