abstract:
- content: "<p></p><p>The key comparison EURAMET.L-K8.2013 on roughness was carried
    out in the framework of a EURAMET project starting in 2013 and ending in 2015.
    It involved the participation of 17 National Metrology Institutes from Europe,
    Asia, South America and Africa representing four regional metrology organisations.
    Five surface texture standards of different type were circulated and on each of
    the standards several roughness parameters according to the standard ISO 4287
    had to be determined. 32 out of 395 individual results were not consistent with
    the reference value. After some corrective actions the number of inconsistent
    results could be reduced to 20, which correspond to about 5% of the total and
    can statistically be expected. In addition to the material standards, two softgauges
    were circulated, which allow to test the software of the instruments used in the
    comparison. The comparison results help to support the calibraton and measurement
    capabilities (CMCs) of the laboratories involved in the CIPM MRA.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
