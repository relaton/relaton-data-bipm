- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A regional supplementary comparison, APMP.L-S4, was held in 2012 to demonstrate the equivalence of routine calibration services offered by NMIs to clients. Participants in this APMP.L-S4 comparison agreed to apply multi-step method for spidle error separation in order to yield the high precision roundness measurement. Eight laboratories from NMIs participated in this supplementary comparison; NIMT, NMIJ, NMIA, NIM, CMS/ITRI, KRISS, NMC/A*STAR and NMISA.</p><p>This report describes the measurement results of 2 glass hemispheres and 2 softgauges. The calibrations of this comparison were carried out by participants during the period from March 2012 to May 2013. The results show that there is a degree of equivalence within 0.8 for all measurands. Hence, there is a close agreement between the measurements.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
