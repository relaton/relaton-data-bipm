    <p></p><p>A trilateral comparison has been performed in the subject field of roundness measurement. The comparison was pilot by VNIIMS, Russia and took place between February 2014 and August 2014. The circulated standards were a roundness transfer standard in the form of a glass hemisphere and a magnification standard often referred to as a 'Flick' standard. Data from the roundness standard were processed using a Gaussian filter and a bandpass up to 50 undulations per revolution to provide a measured value of Roundness Deviation (RONt). For the magnification standard, data were also filtered and the fitted element was the circumscribed circle together with the deviation of the valleys (RONv). The results of comparisons show the correspondence of measurement uncertainties to the declared values and the compared measurement standards are equivalent.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
