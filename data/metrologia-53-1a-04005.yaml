    <p>A bilateral comparison, APMP.L-S6, was held in 2013 to demonstrate the equivalence of routine calibration services of long gauge block offered to clients. Participants in this APMP.L-S6 comparison are NIMT and KRISS. Both agreed to apply comparative method for length measurement of long gauge blocks.</p>
    <p>This report describes the measurement results of 3 long gauge blocks length 150 mm, 250 mm and 500 mm. The artefacts were inspected prior and after the comparison and illustrated that all long gauge block were in stable condition. The results show that there is a degree of equivalence within 1. KRISS had participated in the APMP.L-K2: calibration of long gauge blocks and hence this comparison and the regional key comparison can be linked.</p>
