    <p>A comparison of the air kerma standards for x-radiation qualities used in mammography was performed between the PTB and the IAEA. Two reference-class ionization chamber types Radcal RC6M and Magna A650 of the IAEA and tungsten anode based beam qualities with Mo and Al external filtrations (<italic toggle="yes">W+Mo</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">W+Al</italic>) established at both laboratories were selected for the comparison. The calibration coefficients, <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>
                   <sub>
                      <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>_air</sub>, were determined for the transfer chambers at the PTB in May 2015 and before and after this at the IAEA Dosimetry Laboratory. The results show good agreement, to be well within the 0.55 % standard uncertainty of the comparison. Correction factors to determine <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>
                   <sub>
                      <italic toggle="yes">K</italic>_air</sub> for these beam qualities based on calibration in RQR-M mammography beam qualities, established according to the IEC 61267 standard, were also calculated for the Radcal RC6M, 10X5-6M, and Magna A650 types of chambers.</p>
