    <p></p><p>A direct comparison of the standards for air kerma of the VSL, Netherlands, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beam of the BIPM in April 2016. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the VSL and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9952 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.8 × 10<sup>-3</sup>. The results for an indirect comparison made at the same time are consistent with the direct results at the level of 1 part in 10<sup>4</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
