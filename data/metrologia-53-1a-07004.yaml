    <p></p><p>This report summarizes the results of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) supplementary comparison APMP.M.P-S5 for hydraulic gauge pressure in the range of 1 MPa to 10 MPa, which is a bilateral comparison carried out at the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) and the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany (PTB) during the period June 2014 to June 2015. NIM piloted the comparison and provided the transfer standard, which was a piston-cylinder assembly (PCA) of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> nominal effective area built in a hydraulic pressure balance manufactured by Fluke Corporation. The laboratory standards of NIM and PTB are both hydraulic pressure balances equipped with PCAs, of which the nominal effective area is 1 cm<sup>2</sup> for NIM and 5 cm<sup>2</sup> for PTB. The results of the comparison successfully demonstrated that the hydraulic gauge pressure standards of NIM and PTB in the range of 1 MPa to 10 MPa are equivalent within their claimed uncertainties.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
