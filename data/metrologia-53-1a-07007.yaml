    <p></p><p>This project was a European regional bilateral comparison of volume determination of stainless steel standards of 10 g, 20 g, and 200 g and 1 kg carried out under the auspices of EURAMET (project 1356, EURAMET.M.D-S2).</p><p>The objectives of the present comparison were to check the measurement capabilities of the participants in the field of volume measurements of weights and provide a basis for the calibration measurement capabilities (CMC).</p><p>BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory and the provider of the transfer standards. MKEH was the other participant in the bilateral comparison and NPL collected the measurement data ensuring the impartiality.</p><p>The objectives of the comparison were achieved.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
