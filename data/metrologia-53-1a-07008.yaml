    <p>The purpose of the CIPM comparison CCM.T-K2 was to compare the measuring capabilities up to 20 kN m of deadweight torque standard machines with supported lever and reference-type torque standard machines in national metrology institutes. Five institutes participated, with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB, Braunschweig, Germany) acting as the pilot laboratory. Two very stable torque transducers with well-known properties were used as travelling standards. The circulation of these transducers started in October 2008 and ended in May 2010. According to the technical protocol, torque steps of 10 kN m and 20 kN m had to be measured both in clockwise and anticlockwise directions. Corrections had to be applied to the results reported by the participants taking into account the use of different amplifiers, the creep (due to different loading times of the machines) and the environmental conditions in the laboratories (temperature and relative humidity of the ambient air). For each of the two torque steps and both senses of direction of the torque vector, a key comparison reference value was calculated.</p>
    <p>One participant had a problem with the own machine and the measurement results could not be used for the calculation of the corresponding reference values. The agreement between the results of the other participants is very good. The smallest relative standard uncertainty of the machines stated by the participants is between 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and 2.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup>. The results of the comparison support these uncertainty statements.</p>
