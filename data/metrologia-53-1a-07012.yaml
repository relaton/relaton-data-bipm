    <p>This report summarizes the results of a SIM comparison of magentic properties by means of the susceptometer method. It was carried out by seven SIM laboraories and BIPM. Five standards have been circulated: two OIML weights class E2, two of them with nominal value 1 kg and two of them with nominal value 2 g, and a steel disk. Most of the results were consistent with each other. This final report shows the degree of equivalence achieved by the participants</p>
