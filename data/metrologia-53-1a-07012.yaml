    <p></p><p>This report summarizes the results of a SIM comparison of magentic properties by means of the susceptometer method. It was carried out by seven SIM laboraories and BIPM. Five standards have been circulated: two OIML weights class E2, two of them with nominal value 1 kg and two of them with nominal value 2 g, and a steel disk. Most of the results were consistent with each other. This final report shows the degree of equivalence achieved by the participants</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
