    <p>Many laboratories within EURAMET started a calibration service in medium and high vacuum recently and did not have the opportunity to take part to a comparison before.</p>
    <p>In order to assess the uncertainty budget and the quality of the measurement of these laboratories, an intercomparison, EURAMET 1040 registered as EURAMET.M.P-S7, from 0.1 mPa to 0.9 Pa has been organised. The participants are the CMI (Czech republic), EIM (Greece), IMT (Slovenia), INRIM (Italy), IMBIH (Bosnia Herzegovinia) and MIKES (Finland) while METAS (Switzerland) is pilot laboratory. Three laboratories (INRIM, CMI and METAS) involved in this work have a primary definition of the pressure.</p>
    <p>Two spinning rotor gauges and a control electronic are used as transfer standard. The circulation of the transfer standard is organised as a succession of loops with a measurement by the pilot between each participant.</p>
    <p>A reference value has been determined based on a weighted mean of the results of the primary laboratories. All the participants have demonstrated their equivalence in the definition of the pressure.</p>
    <p>This comparison has been used as pilot comparison for the CCM.P-K14 project which covers the same scope with similar transfer standards.</p>
