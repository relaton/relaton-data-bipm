    <p>This report describes EURAMET supplementary comparison EURAMET.M.F-S3, a comparison between the 20 kN force standard machine of NPL and the 10 kN force standard machine of INMETRO, at generated forces of 1 kN, 2 kN, 5 kN, and 10 kN, in both tension and compression, with both incremental and decremental loading. Two different transducers were used and the force-time profile was strictly controlled, to minimise effects of creep. At all four force levels, the results demonstrate that there is no evidence that either machine fails to generate forces in accordance with its CMC.</p>
