    <p></p><p>It was decided at the EURAMET TC-M meeting in Torino in 2006 to realize a comparison in gauge and absolute pressure up to 200 kPa as it would allow a link to the CCM.P-K6 and CCM.P-K2 comparisons to be established. This project interested a lot of laboratories from the beginning with 23 participants, 22 of which have submitted results. The circulation of the transfer standard began in July 2009 and lasted until January 2012. No major problems occurred during the transport.</p><p>The measurand of the comparison is the effective area of a piston-cylinder determined in gauge and absolute pressure from 25 kPa to 200 kPa with pressure steps of 25 kPa. The transfer standard is a gas lubricated tungsten carbide piston-cylinder with an effective area of ~9.8 cm<sup>2</sup>, fabricated by DH Instruments and compatible with a PG-7601 pressure balance. Some participants used their own pressure balance while a pressure balance with a reference vacuum sensor has been circulated for the participants not equipped with this system.</p><p>One participant (SMU, Slovakia) has never provided the measurement results and another participant (FORCE Technology, Denmark) submitted a revised set of measurement results after the pilot laboratory mentioned that the equivalence was not met.</p><p>After the determination of the reference value, all the 22 participants who delivered the results in gauge pressure demonstrated equivalence respective to the reference value on most of the range. In absolute pressure the equivalence is demonstrated, for all nominal pressures, by all 17 participants who submitted results.</p><p>The comparison is linked to the CCM.P-K6 for gauge pressure and to CCM.P-K2 for absolute pressure. The link does not strongly affect the equivalence of the results and an excellent degree of equivalence is achieved in gauge and absolute pressure.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
