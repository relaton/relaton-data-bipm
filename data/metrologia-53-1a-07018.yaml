    <p>Seven laboratories: BEV (Austria), CENAM (Mexico), CMS (Chinese-Taipei), LNE-TRAPIL (France), NEL (United Kingdom), NMIA (Australia), and the pilot lab NMIJ (Japan), participated in the key comparison CCM.FF-K2.2015 for hydrocarbon flow measurement. A screw type positive displacement flow meter was selected as a transfer standard. The calibration stability of the transfer standard was evaluated from repeated measurements by NMIJ and showed standard reproducibility of 0.0035 %. The transfer standard was also thoroughly tested for sensitivity to temperature, viscosity, pressure, and other effects. The uncertainty due to the transfer standard of 0.0080 % was less than the quoted uncertainties of the participants. The key comparison reference values (KCRVs) at Reynolds number of 70 000 and 300 000 were obtained as the weighted mean from the calibration results, and the KCRV at Reynolds number of 100 000 was obtained as the median by using the Monte Carlo method according to Cox's procedure B, since the consistency check at Reynolds number of 100 000 failed at the 95 % confidence level. All participant results selected to determine the KCRVs have En values which show consistency with the evaluated KCRVs.</p>
