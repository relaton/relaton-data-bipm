    <p>The results of the key comparison EUROMET 627 (EUROMET.M.D-K2) are presented. This project covered the density measurements of three liquids: dodecane, water and an oil of high viscosity measured at 15 °C, 20 °C and 40 °C. Seven European metrology laboratories and the South African laboratory CSIR-NML (now: NMISA) measured the densities at atmospheric pressure by hydrostatic weighing of solid density standards between 04 October 2001 and 18 December 2001. The stability and homogeneity of the liquids were investigated by the pilot laboratory PTB.</p><p>The results generally show good agreement among the participants. Only for the simple Mohr-Westphal balances do the uncertainties seem to be underestimated by the laboratories. Furthermore, the measurement of high-viscosity oil was difficult for some laboratories.</p><p>Nevertheless, the five laboratories PTB/DE, BNM/FR (now: LNE/FR), OMH/HU (now: MKEH/HU), IMGC/IT (now: INRIM/IT) and GUM/PL agree with each other for stated uncertainties of 0.05 kg/m<sup>3</sup> or less. This satisfies the current needs of customers who wish to calibrate or check liquid density measuring instruments such as oscillation-type density meters.</p><p>No reference values were calculated since the subsequent CCM key comparison CCM.D-K2 had a different scope and the EUROMET 627 comparison was soon superseded by the EURAMET 1019 (EURAMET.M.D-K2) comparison.</p><p>
