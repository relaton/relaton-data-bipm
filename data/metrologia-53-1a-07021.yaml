    <p>The National Metrology Institute of Japan, AIST (NMIJ/AIST), Japan, and the Research Center for Metrology, LIPI (RCM-LIPI), Indonesia, had agreed to organize an inter-laboratory comparison program in the torque measurement at 1 kN·m and 2 kN·m for the torque measuring device. The objective of the project is to compare the performance of torque standards in participating institutes, in the torque range from 1 kN·m to 2 kN·m for torque measuring devices. The agreement between the results of two participants was very good. The smallest relative standard uncertainties of the machines stated by the participants are 6.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and 3.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup>. The results of this comparison will be used supporting evidence for CMCs in this range.</p>
