abstract:
- content: "<p></p><p>Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is an important compound in monitoring
    climate change and is monitored by the World Meteorological Organization Global
    Atmospheric Watch Volatile Organic Compounds (WMO-GAW VOC) program at several
    monitoring sites. It is essential that measurement results are accurate and consistent
    among the assigned values for primary gas mixtures to meet the WMO requirement.
    The purpose of this comparison is to compare the measurement capability of DMS
    at approximately 10 μ­mol/mol and expectation to contribute the establishment
    of traceability to single measurement scale for DMS between NMIs.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To
