    <p>The relevance of the COOMET.QM-S5 comparison is founded on tightening of requirements to a control of automobile emissions (realization of environmental standards of EURO 4, EURO-5). Participating laboratories: VNIIM, BAM, BelGIM, Ukrmetrteststandart, KazInMetr. This comparison was carried out in 2013-2014. This supplementary comparison supports CMC claims for: CO<sub>2</sub> in the range (4–16) · 10<sup>−2</sup> mol/mol; CO in the range (0.5–5) · 10<sup>−2</sup> mol/mol; C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> in the range (0.01–0.3) · 10<sup>−2</sup> mol/mol. Results:</p>

                   <bold>Component CO:</bold>
                </p>
    <p>All laboratories identified the values of carbon monoxide mole fraction in the gas mixture within ±0.9134%.</p>

                   <bold>Component CO<sub>2</sub>:</bold>
                </p>
    <p>All laboratories identified the values of carbon dioxide mole fraction in the gas mixture within ±0.3042%.</p>

                   <bold>Component C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>:</bold>
                </p>
    <p>All laboratories identified the values of propane mole fraction in the gas mixture within ±0.443%.</p>
