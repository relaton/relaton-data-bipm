- content: |-
    <p></p><p>The relevance of the COOMET.QM-K93 comparison is founded on paying particular attention to reliability of measurements which are performed during the medical examination of drivers of vehicles in order to assess the degree of alcoholic intoxication. Standard gas mixtures of ethanol in nitrogen in cylinders under pressure play a key role in providing metrological assurance of breath-alcohol analyzers. Participating laboratories: VNIIM and Ukrmetrteststandart. This comparison was carried out in 2014-2015. This supplementary comparison supports CMC claims for: ethanol in the range 50–500 μmol/mol in a matrix of either nitrogen or synthetic air.</p><p>Results:</p><p>The results are consistent with the reference values.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
