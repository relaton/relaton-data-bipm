    <p></p><p>At the CCQM Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) Meeting held in April 2012 and the APMP TCQM Meeting held in November 2012, an APMP supplementary comparison (APMP.QM-S6) on the determination of clenbuterol in porcine meat was supported by the OAWG and APMP TCQM. This comparison was organized by the Government Laboratory, Hong Kong. In order to accommodate a wider participation, a pilot study (APMP.QM-P22) was run in parallel to APMP.QM-S6.</p><p>This study provided the means for assessing the measurement capabilities for determination of low-polarity measurands in a procedure that requires extraction, clean-up, analytical separation, and selective detection in a food matrix. A total of 7 institutes registered for the supplementary comparison and 6 of them submitted their results. 4 results were included for SCRV calculation. All participating laboratories applied Isotope Dilution Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (ID-LCMS/MS) technique with clenbuterol-d9 as internal standard spiked for quantitation in this programme.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>APMP.QM-S6 and Clenbuterol</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
