    <p></p><p>The CCQM-K48.2014 (CCQM-K114) key comparison for determination of the purity of potassium chloride was organized jointly by the inorganic analysis and electrochemical analysis working groups of CCQM to repeat a sub-set of comparisons to support CMC claims for all institutes in the relevant ranges with timely experimental data to measure the amount content of chloride in KCl. National Institute of Metrology P.R.China (NIM) acted as the coordinating laboratory of this comparison. Ten NMIs participated in this key comparison. All participants used coulometry and all of them analyzed the bromine impurity in the sample and made corrections. In general a very good overlap of results was observed and also the results for bromide are consistent with one exception.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
