    <p>This is the final report of the AFRIMETS.AUV-S1 comparison of the pressure sensitivity, modulus and phase, of LS2aP microphones in the frequency range 1 Hz to 31.5 kHz in accordance with IEC 61094-2. Six national metrology institutes from three different regional metrology organisations participated in the comparison for which two LS2aP microphones were circulated simultaneously to all the participants in a hybrid-star configuration. The comparison reference values were calculated as the weighted mean for modulus and phase for each individual microphone.</p>
