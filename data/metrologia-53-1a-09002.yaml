    <p>The CCAUV.U-K3.1 is a follow-up of the comparison CCAUV.U-K3 which was the third key comparison in the ultrasound branch organised under the auspices of the Consultative Committee for Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the BIPM. It was necessary to allow participants with discrepant values and additional laboratories to have another possibility to take part in an international comparison and to test their measurement facilities. The comparison dealt with power measurement in the frequency range 2 to 10.5 MHz and a power range between 10 mW and 15 W. The parameter range covered is of particular importance for medical applications of ultrasound.</p>
