abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a cryogenic method for the measurement of total hemispherical
    emissivity and absorptivity of various materials at temperatures from 320 K down
    to  ≈20 K. In absorptivity measurement the temperature of the examined sample
    is kept at  ≈5 K–35 K. Radiative heat flow between two plane parallel surfaces
    of 40 mm in diameter disk samples placed in a vacuum, a sample and a disk with
    reference surface, is absorbed by a colder sample and sinks into an LHe bath via
    a thermal resistor (heat flow meter). Heat flow is measured by substitution method,
    using thermal output of an electrical heater for heat flow meter calibration.
    A great deal of attention is paid to the estimation of uncertainties associated
    with this method. Capabilities of the instrument are demonstrated by the absorptivity
    and emissivity measurement of the pure aluminium sample. The expanded fractional
    uncertainty (k  =  2) in emissivity ε  =  0.0041 measured at  ≈30 K for pure aluminium
    is less than 11% and for values of emissivity ε  &gt;  0.0053 measured above 60 K
    the uncertainties are below 7%. The method was designed primarily for the measurement
    of highly reflective materials like pure metals, nevertheless high emissivity
    of the reference sample also enables the measurement of non-metallic materials
    with reasonable accuracy.</p>
