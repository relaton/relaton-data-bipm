abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRLS) were used to simulate
    the L<sub>p</sub>-norm approximation of the ballistic trajectory in absolute gravimeters.
    Two iterations of the IRLS delivered sufficient accuracy of the approximation
    without a significant bias. The simulations were performed on different samplings
    and perturbations of the trajectory. For the platykurtic distributions of the
    perturbations, the L<sub>p</sub>-approximation with 3  &lt;  p  &lt;  4 was found
    to yield several times more precise gravity estimates compared to the standard
    least-squares. The simulation results were confirmed by processing real gravity
    observations performed at the excessive noise conditions.</p>
