    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Iteratively re-weighted least squares (IRLS) were used to simulate the <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>-norm approximation of the ballistic trajectory in absolute gravimeters. Two iterations of the IRLS delivered sufficient accuracy of the approximation without a significant bias. The simulations were performed on different samplings and perturbations of the trajectory. For the platykurtic distributions of the perturbations, the <italic>L</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>-approximation with 3  &lt;  <italic>p</italic>  &lt;  4 was found to yield several times more precise gravity estimates compared to the standard least-squares. The simulation results were confirmed by processing real gravity observations performed at the excessive noise conditions.</p>
