abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The conventional mass is a useful concept introduced to reduce
    the impact of the buoyancy correction in everyday mass measurements, thus avoiding
    in most cases its accurate determination, necessary in measurements of ‘true’
    mass. Although usage of conventional mass is universal and standardized, the concept
    is considered as a sort of second-choice tool, to be avoided in high-accuracy
    applications. In this paper we show that this is a false belief, by elucidating
    the role played by covariances between volume and mass and between volume and
    conventional mass at the various stages of the dissemination chain and in the
    relationship between the uncertainties of mass and conventional mass. We arrive
    at somewhat counter-intuitive results: the volume of the transfer standard plays
    a comparatively minor role in the uncertainty budget of the standard under calibration.
    In addition, conventional mass is preferable to mass in normal, in-air operation,
    as its uncertainty is smaller than that of mass, if covariance terms are properly
    taken into account, and the uncertainty over-stating (typically) resulting from
    neglecting them is less severe than that (always) occurring with mass. The same
    considerations hold for force. In this respect, we show that the associated uncertainty
    is the same using mass or conventional mass, and, again, that the latter is preferable
    if covariance terms are neglected.</p>'
