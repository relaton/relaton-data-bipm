abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A substitution method to measure seawater density relative to
    pure water density using vibrating tube densimeters was realized and validated.
    Standard uncertainties of 1 g m<sup>−3</sup> at atmospheric pressure, 10 g m<sup>−3</sup>
    up to 10 MPa, and 20 g m<sup>−3</sup> to 65 MPa in the temperature range of 5
    °C to 35 °C and for salt contents up to 35 g kg<sup>−1</sup> were achieved. The
    realization was validated by comparison measurements with a hydrostatic weighing
    apparatus for atmospheric pressure. For high pressures, literature values of seawater
    compressibility were compared with substitution measurements of the realized apparatus.</p>
