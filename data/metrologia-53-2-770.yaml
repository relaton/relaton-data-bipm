    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A substitution method to measure seawater density relative to pure water density using vibrating tube densimeters was realized and validated. Standard uncertainties of 1 g m<sup>−3</sup> at atmospheric pressure, 10 g m<sup>−3</sup> up to 10 MPa, and 20 g m<sup>−3</sup> to 65 MPa in the temperature range of 5 °C to 35 °C and for salt contents up to 35 g kg<sup>−1</sup> were achieved. The realization was validated by comparison measurements with a hydrostatic weighing apparatus for atmospheric pressure. For high pressures, literature values of seawater compressibility were compared with substitution measurements of the realized apparatus.</p>
