abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This article builds upon a previous work dealing with the budget
    of uncertainties associated to our recent determination of the Boltzmann constant
    by means of Doppler broadening thermometry. We report on the outcomes of theoretical
    calculations and numerical simulations aimed to precisely quantify the influence
    of the unresolved hyperfine structure of a given ortho component of the H218 >O
    spectrum at 1.4 μm on the measurement of the Doppler width of the line itself.
    We have found that, if the hyperfine structure of the 44,1&#x2192;44,0 > line
    of the &#x03BD;1&plus;&#x03BD;3 > band was ignored, the spectroscopic measurement
    of the Boltzmann constant would be affected by a relative systematical deviation
    of 4&#x22C5;10&#x2212;8 >.</p>
