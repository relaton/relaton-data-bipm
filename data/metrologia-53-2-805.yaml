abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A yoke-based permanent magnet, which has been employed in many
    watt balances at national metrology institutes, is supposed to generate strong
    and uniform magnetic field in an air gap in the radial direction. However, in
    reality the fringe effect due to the finite height of the air gap will introduce
    an undesired vertical magnetic component to the air gap, which should either be
    measured or modeled towards some optimizations of the watt balance. A recent publication,
    i.e. Li et al (2015 Metrologia 52 445), presented a full field mapping method,
    which in theory will supply useful information for profile characterization and
    misalignment analysis. This article is an additional material of Li et al (2015
    Metrologia 52 445), which develops a different analytical algorithm to represent
    the 3D magnetic field of a watt balance magnet based on only one measurement for
    the radial magnetic flux density along the vertical direction, B<sub>r</sub>(z).
    The new algorithm is based on the electromagnetic nature of the magnet, which
    has a much better accuracy.</p>
