abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A watt balance is a precision apparatus for the measurement
    of the Planck constant that has been proposed as a primary method for realizing
    the unit of mass in a revised International System of Units. In contrast to an
    ampere balance, which was historically used to realize the unit of current in
    terms of the kilogram, the watt balance relates electrical and mechanical units
    through a virtual power measurement and has far greater precision. However, because
    the virtual power measurement requires the execution of a prescribed motion of
    a coil in a fixed magnetic field, systematic errors introduced by horizontal and
    rotational deviations of the coil from its prescribed path will compromise the
    accuracy. We model these potential errors using an analysis that accounts for
    the fringing field in the magnet, creating a framework for assessing the impact
    of this class of errors on the uncertainty of watt balance results.</p>
