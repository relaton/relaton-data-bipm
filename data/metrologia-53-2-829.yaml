abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The combination of isotope dilution and mass spectrometry has
    become an ubiquitous tool of chemical analysis. Often perceived as one of the
    most accurate methods of chemical analysis, it is not without shortcomings. Current
    isotope dilution equations are not capable of fully addressing one of the key
    problems encountered in chemical analysis: the possible effect of sample matrix
    on measured isotope ratios. The method of standard addition does compensate for
    the effect of sample matrix by making sure that all measured solutions have identical
    composition. While it is impossible to attain such condition in traditional isotope
    dilution, we present equations which allow for matrix-matching between all measured
    solutions by fusion of isotope dilution and standard addition methods.</p>'
