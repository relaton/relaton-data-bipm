abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Gravity meters must be aligned with the local gravity at any
    location on the surface of the earth in order to measure the full amplitude of
    the gravity vector. The gravitational force on the sensitive component of the
    gravity meter decreases by the cosine of the angle between the measurement axis
    and the local gravity vector. Most gravity meters incorporate two horizontal orthogonal
    levels to orient the gravity meter for a maximum gravity reading. In order to
    calculate a gravity correction it is often necessary to estimate the overall angular
    deviation between the gravity meter and the local gravity vector using two measured
    horizontal tilt meters. Typically this is done assuming that the two horizontal
    angles are independent and that the product of the cosines of the horizontal tilts
    is equivalent to the cosine of the overall deviation. These approximations, however,
    break down at large angles. This paper derives analytic formulae to transform
    angles measured by two orthogonal tilt meters into the vertical deviation of the
    third orthogonal axis. The equations can be used to calibrate the tilt sensors
    attached to the gravity meter or provide a correction for a gravity meter used
    in an off-of-level condition.</p>
