    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In response to the strong demand for a total spectral radiant flux (TSRF) standard from domestic lighting manufacturers, such a scale has been realized in the visible range by means of a relative gonio-spectroradiometric method at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ). Our gonio-spectroradiometric method employs spectral irradiance as well as a luminous intensity standard as reference standards. We have investigated several models of quartz-halogen lamps from domestic manufacturers with respect to their stability and decided a set of reference standard lamps for TSRF. Our carefully selected quartz-halogen lamps have sufficient stability as the standard lamp for TSRF after a 100 h seasoning process. The relative expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>  =  2) for realization of the TSRF scale is between 3.1% (visible regions) and 4.1% (near ultraviolet region). We evaluated uncertainties related to the characteristics of the array spectroradiometer using experimental results and found some of those, such as effect of bandpass function, noticeably contributed to the total uncertainty.</p>
