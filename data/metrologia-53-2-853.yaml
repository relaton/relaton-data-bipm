abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In response to the strong demand for a total spectral radiant
    flux (TSRF) standard from domestic lighting manufacturers, such a scale has been
    realized in the visible range by means of a relative gonio-spectroradiometric
    method at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ). Our gonio-spectroradiometric
    method employs spectral irradiance as well as a luminous intensity standard as
    reference standards. We have investigated several models of quartz-halogen lamps
    from domestic manufacturers with respect to their stability and decided a set
    of reference standard lamps for TSRF. Our carefully selected quartz-halogen lamps
    have sufficient stability as the standard lamp for TSRF after a 100 h seasoning
    process. The relative expanded uncertainty (k  =  2) for realization of the TSRF
    scale is between 3.1% (visible regions) and 4.1% (near ultraviolet region). We
    evaluated uncertainties related to the characteristics of the array spectroradiometer
    using experimental results and found some of those, such as effect of bandpass
    function, noticeably contributed to the total uncertainty.</p>
