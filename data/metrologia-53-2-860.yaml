abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Thermal noise is a limiting factor in many high-precision optical
    experiments. A search is underway for novel optical materials with reduced thermal
    noise. One such pair of materials, gallium arsenide and aluminum-alloyed gallium
    arsenide (collectively referred to as AlGaAs), shows promise for its low Brownian
    noise when compared to conventional materials such as silica and tantala. However,
    AlGaAs has the potential to produce a high level of thermo-optic noise. We have
    fabricated a set of AlGaAs crystalline coatings, transferred to fused silica substrates,
    whose layer structure has been optimized to reduce thermo-optic noise by inducing
    coherent cancellation of the thermoelastic and thermorefractive effects. By measuring
    the photothermal transfer function of these mirrors, we find evidence that this
    optimization has been successful.</p>
