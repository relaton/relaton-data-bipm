abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Sub-monolayer sensitivity to controlled gas adsorption and desorption
    is demonstrated using a double paddle oscillator (DPO) installed within an ultra-high
    vacuum (UHV) environmental chamber equipped with in situ film deposition, (multi)gas
    admission and temperature control. This effort is intended to establish a robust
    framework for quantitatively comparing mass changes due to gas loading and unloading
    on different materials systems selected or considered for use as mass artefacts.
    Our apparatus is composed of a UHV chamber with gas introduction and temperature
    control and in situ materials deposition for future materials testing enabling
    in situ preparation of virgin surfaces that can be monitored during initial exposure
    to gasses of interest. These tools are designed to allow us to comparatively evaluate
    how different materials gain or lose mass due to precisely controlled environmental
    excursions, with a long term goal of measuring changes in absolute mass. Herein,
    we provide a detailed experimental description of the apparatus, an evaluation
    of the initial performance, and demonstration measurements using nitrogen adsorption
    and desorption directly on the DPO.</p>
