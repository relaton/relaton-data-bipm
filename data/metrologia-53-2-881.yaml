abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To keep national time accurately coherent with coordinated universal
    time, many national metrology institutes (NMIs) use two-way satellite time and
    frequency transfer (TWSTFT) to continuously measure the time difference with other
    NMIs over an international baseline. Some NMIs have ultra-stable clocks with stability
    better than 10<sup>−16</sup>. However, current operational TWSTFT can only provide
    frequency uncertainty of 10<sup>−15</sup> and time uncertainty of 1 ns, which
    is inadequate. The uncertainty is dominated by the short-term stability and the
    diurnals, i.e. the measurement variation with a period of one day. The aim of
    this work is to improve the stability of operational TWSTFT systems without additional
    transmission, bandwidth or increase in signal power. A software-defined receiver
    (SDR) comprising a high-resolution correlator and successive interference cancellation
    associated with open-loop configuration as the TWSTFT receiver reduces the time
    deviation from 140 ps to 73 ps at averaging time of 1 h, and occasionally suppresses
    diurnals. To study the source of the diurnals, TWSTFT is performed using a 2  ×  2
    earth station (ES) array. Consequently, some ESs sensitive to temperature variation
    are identified, and the diurnals are significantly reduced by employing insensitive
    ESs. Hence, the operational TWSTFT using the proposed SDR with insensitive ESs
    achieves time deviation to 41 ps at 1 h, and 80 ps for averaging times from 1 h
    to 20 h.</p>
