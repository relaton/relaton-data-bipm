abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Optical approaches for hydrophone calibrations offer significant
    advantages over existing methods based on reciprocity. In particular, heterodyne
    and homodyne interferometry can accurately measure particle velocity and displacements
    at a specific point in space thus enabling the acoustical pressure to be measured
    in an absolute, direct, assumption-free manner, with traceability through the
    SI definition of the metre. The calibration of a hydrophone can then be performed
    by placing the active element of the sensor at the point where the acoustic pressure
    field was measured and monitoring its electrical output. However, it is crucial
    to validate the performance and accuracy of such optical methods by direct comparison
    rather than through device calibration. Here we report on the direct comparison
    of two such optical interferometers used in underwater acoustics and ultrasonics
    in terms of acoustic pressure estimation and their associated uncertainties in
    the frequency range 200 kHzâ€“3.5 MHz, with results showing agreement better than
    1% in terms of pressure and typical expanded uncertainties better than 3% for
    both reported methods.</p>
