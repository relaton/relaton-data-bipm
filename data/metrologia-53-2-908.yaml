    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We present a practical calibration method of the detection efficiency (DE) of single photon detectors (SPDs) in a wide wavelength range from 480 nm to 840 nm. The setup consists of a GaN laser diode emitting a broadband luminescence, a tunable bandpass filter, a beam splitter, and a switched integrating amplifier which can measure the photocurrent down to the 100 fA level. The SPD under test with a fibre-coupled beam input is directly compared with a reference photodiode without using any calibrated attenuator. The relative standard uncertainty of the DE of the SPD is evaluated to be from 0.8% to 2.2% varying with wavelength (<italic>k</italic>  =  1).</p>
