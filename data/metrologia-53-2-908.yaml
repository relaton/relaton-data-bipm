abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a practical calibration method of the detection efficiency
    (DE) of single photon detectors (SPDs) in a wide wavelength range from 480 nm
    to 840 nm. The setup consists of a GaN laser diode emitting a broadband luminescence,
    a tunable bandpass filter, a beam splitter, and a switched integrating amplifier
    which can measure the photocurrent down to the 100 fA level. The SPD under test
    with a fibre-coupled beam input is directly compared with a reference photodiode
    without using any calibrated attenuator. The relative standard uncertainty of
    the DE of the SPD is evaluated to be from 0.8% to 2.2% varying with wavelength
    (k  =  1).</p>
