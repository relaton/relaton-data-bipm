abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures has carried out
    calibrations of the platinum–iridium kilogram mass standards by referencing the
    international prototype of the kilogram for the first time since the third periodic
    verification of national prototypes of the kilogram was carried out in 1988–92.
    This calibration campaign was designated ‘Extraordinary Calibrations’ in the second
    phase, in which two platinum–iridium kilogram mass standards of the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan were calibrated with a standard uncertainty of 3.5 μg. By adding
    these new calibration data into our data sets from 1991, we established our mass
    unit with a standard uncertainty of 3.3 μg by least-squares analysis using an
    exponential model, which is useful for compensating for mass increase after cleaning
    the mass standards. Moreover, it was found that our established mass unit following
    the Extraordinary Calibrations shifted against our previously maintained mass
    unit by  −20.8 μg as of the beginning of 2015. The analysis with a linear model
    revealed that the amount of mass increase over time of some standards was significantly
    smaller than that suggested at the third periodic verification of national prototypes
    of the kilogram. The analysis with the exponential model gave an exponent of 0.217
    with a standard uncertainty of 0.057. This suggests that the mass increase due
    to surface contamination cannot be explained by a diffusion-limited process.</p>
