abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The radian and steradian are unusual units within the SI, originally
    belonging to their own category of ‘supplementary units’, with this status being
    changed to dimensionless ‘derived units’ in 1995. Recent papers have suggested
    that angles could be handled in two different ways within the SI, both differing
    from the present system. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for
    putting such suggestions into context, outlining the range of options that is
    available, together with the advantages and disadvantages of these options.</p><p>Although
    less rigorously logical than some alternatives, the present SI approach is generally
    supported, but with some changes to the SI brochure to make the position clearer,
    in particular with regard to the designation of the radian and steradian as derived
    units.</p>
