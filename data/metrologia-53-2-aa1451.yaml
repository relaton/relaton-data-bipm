abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Although the relativistic manifestations of gravitational fields
    in gravimetry were first studied 40 years ago, the relativistic effects combined
    with free-fall absolute gravimeters have rarely been considered. In light of this,
    we present a general relativistic model for free-fall absolute gravimeters in
    a local-Fermi coordinates system, where we focus on effects related to the measuring
    devices: relativistic transverse Doppler effects, gravitational redshift effects
    and Earthâ€™s rotation effects. Based on this model, a general relativistic expression
    of the measured gravity acceleration is obtained.</p>'
