abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A cryogenic fixed point cell has been filled with high purity
    (99.999%) sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) and measured in an adiabatic closed-cycle
    cryostat system. Temperature measurements of the SF<sub>6</sub> melting curve
    were performed using a capsule-type standard platinum resistance thermometer (CSPRT)
    calibrated over the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) subrange
    from the triple point of equilibrium hydrogen to the triple point of water. The
    measured temperatures were corrected by 0.37 mK for the effects of thermometer
    self-heating, and the liquidus-point temperature estimated by extrapolation to
    melted fraction F  =  1 of a simple linear regression versus melted fraction F
    in the range F  =  0.53 to 0.84. Based on this measurement, the temperature of
    the triple point of sulfur hexafluoride is shown to be 223.555 23(49) K (k  =  1)
    on the ITS-90. This value is in excellent agreement with the best prior measurements
    reported in the literature, but with considerably smaller uncertainty. An analysis
    of the detailed uncertainty budget of this measurement suggests that if the triple
    point of sulfur hexafluoride were to be included as a defining fixed point of
    the next revision of the International Temperature Scale, it could do so with
    a total realization uncertainty of approximately 0.43 mK, slightly larger than
    the realization uncertainties of the defining fixed points of the ITS-90. Since
    the combined standard uncertainty of this SF<sub>6</sub> triple point temperature
    determination is dominated by chemical impurity effects, further research exploring
    gas purification techniques and the influence of specific impurity species on
    the SF<sub>6</sub> triple point temperature may bring the realization uncertainty
    of SF<sub>6</sub> as a fixed point material into the range of the defining fixed
    points of the ITS-90.</p>
