abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>It could be argued that activity measurements of radioactive
    substances should be under statistical control, considering that the measurand
    is unambiguously defined, the radioactive decay processes are theoretically well
    understood and the measurement function can be derived from physical principles.
    However, comparisons invariably show a level of discrepancy among activity standardisation
    results that exceeds expectation from uncertainty evaluations. Also decay characteristics
    of radionuclides determined from different experiments show unexpected inconsistencies.
    Arguably, the problem lies mainly in incomplete uncertainty assessment. Of the
    various reasons leading to incomplete uncertainty assessment, from human failure
    to limitations to the state-of-the-art knowledge, a selection of cases is discussed
    in which imperfections in the modelling of the measurement process can lead to
    unexpectedly large underestimations of uncertainty.</p>
