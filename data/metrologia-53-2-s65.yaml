abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The paper illustrates, by means of selected examples, the merits
    and the limits of the method for computing coverage intervals described in the
    Supplement 1 to the GUM. The assessment of coverage intervals is done by evaluating
    their long-run success rate. Three pairs of examples are presented, relative to
    three different ways of generating incomplete knowledge about quantities: toss
    of dice, presence of additive noise, quantization. In all the pairs of examples,
    the first one results in a coverage interval with a long-run success rate equal
    to the coverage probability (set to 95%); the second one, instead, yields an interval
    with a success rate near to zero. The paper shows that the propagation mechanism
    of the Supplement 1, while working well in certain special cases, yields unacceptable
    results in others, and that the problematic issues cannot be neglected. The conclusion
    is that, if a Bayesian approach to uncertainty evaluation is adopted, the propagation
    is a particularly delicate issue.</p>'
