abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The paper ‘A detailed comparison of two continuous GPS carrier-phase
    time transfer techniques’ (Yao et al 2015 Metrologia 52 666) presents the revised
    RINEX-shift (RRS) method, a technique using ‘classical precise point positioning
    (PPP)’ solutions on sliding batches and aiming at providing continuous time links.
    The authors claim the superiority of the RRS technique with respect to ‘classical
    PPP’ in terms of frequency stability and solving for discontinuities due to data
    gaps. It is shown here that these conclusions do not rely on physical principles,
    and are erroneous as they are driven by misinterpreted or corrupted PPP solutions.
    Using state-of-the-art PPP computation on the same data sets used in Yao et al’s
    paper (2015 Metrologia 52 666), we show that the stability of RRS is at best similar
    to that of ‘classical PPP’ (within statistical uncertainties). Furthermore, the
    RRS method of removing discontinuities in case of data gaps by interpolating the
    phase data should not be applied systematically as it can cause erroneous clock
    solutions when the data gaps are associated with a true phase discontinuity.</p>
