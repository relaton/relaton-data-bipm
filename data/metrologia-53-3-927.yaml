abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Electron storage rings with appropriate design are primary source
    standards, the spectral radiant intensity of which can be calculated from measured
    parameters using the Schwinger equation. PTB uses the electron storage rings BESSY
    II and MLS for source-based radiometry in the spectral range from the near-infrared
    to the x-ray region. The uncertainty of the calculated radiant intensity depends
    on the uncertainty of the measured parameters used for the calculation. Up to
    now the procedure described in the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement
    (GUM), i.e. the law of propagation of uncertainty, assuming a linear measurement
    model, was used to determine the combined uncertainty of the calculated spectral
    intensity, and for the determination of the coverage interval as well. Now it
    has been tested with a Monte Carlo simulation, according to Supplement 1 to the
    GUM, whether this procedure is valid for the rather complicated calculation by
    means of the Schwinger formalism and for different probability distributions of
    the input parameters. It was found that for typical uncertainties of the input
    parameters both methods yield similar results.</p>
