abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the work carried out to evaluate the radiometric
    performance of a radiance-meter system which has been built at the LNE-Cnam to
    determine the thermodynamic temperature of high-temperature fixed points. The
    work comes as an integral part of the ‘implementing the new Kelvin’ (INK) project
    in which nine National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) strive to assign the thermodynamic
    temperatures to the melting curve of high-temperature fixed points with the lowest
    possible uncertainty. The method used in this research is based on the radiance
    approach. It exploits a system based on a laser-illuminated integrating sphere
    source whose radiance is absolutely measured by a trap detector through a well-defined
    geometry. The trap detector is calibrated traceable to the LNE-Cnam’s cryogenic
    radiometer. Once the radiance of the sphere is defined, a single grating-based
    spectroradiometer is used to measure the radiance of the fixed point source at
    the laser wavelength through direct comparison with the sphere radiance. This
    allows the thermodynamic temperature of the fixed point to be determined using
    Planck’s radiation law. The work provides a thorough evaluation of the system
    along with a detailed study of all related systematic effects and their corresponding
    uncertainties.</p>
