abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An errors-in-variables regression method is presented as an
    alternative to the ordinary least-squares regression computation currently employed
    for determining the calibration function for force measuring instruments from
    data acquired during calibration. A Monte Carlo uncertainty evaluation for the
    errors-in-variables regression is also presented. The corresponding function (which
    we call measurement function, often called analysis function in gas metrology)
    necessary for the subsequent use of the calibrated device to measure force, and
    the associated uncertainty evaluation, are also derived from the calibration results.
    Comparisons are made, using real force calibration data, between the results from
    the errors-in-variables and ordinary least-squares analyses, as well as between
    the Monte Carlo uncertainty assessment and the conventional uncertainty propagation
    employed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The results
    show that the errors-in-variables analysis properly accounts for the uncertainty
    in the applied calibrated forces, and that the Monte Carlo method, owing to its
    intrinsic ability to model uncertainty contributions accurately, yields a better
    representation of the calibration uncertainty throughout the transducerâ€™s force
    range than the methods currently in use. These improvements notwithstanding, the
    differences between the results produced by the current and by the proposed new
    methods generally are small because the relative uncertainties of the inputs are
    small and most contemporary load cells respond approximately linearly to such
    inputs. For this reason, there will be no compelling need to revise any of the
    force calibration reports previously issued by NIST.</p>
