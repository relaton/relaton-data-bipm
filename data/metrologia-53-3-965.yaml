    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>An errors-in-variables regression method is presented as an alternative to the ordinary least-squares regression computation currently employed for determining the calibration function for force measuring instruments from data acquired during calibration. A Monte Carlo uncertainty evaluation for the errors-in-variables regression is also presented. The corresponding function (which we call <italic>measurement function</italic>, often called <italic>analysis function</italic> in gas metrology) necessary for the subsequent use of the calibrated device to measure force, and the associated uncertainty evaluation, are also derived from the calibration results. Comparisons are made, using real force calibration data, between the results from the errors-in-variables and ordinary least-squares analyses, as well as between the Monte Carlo uncertainty assessment and the conventional uncertainty propagation employed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The results show that the errors-in-variables analysis properly accounts for the uncertainty in the applied calibrated forces, and that the Monte Carlo method, owing to its intrinsic ability to model uncertainty contributions accurately, yields a better representation of the calibration uncertainty throughout the transducerâ€™s force range than the methods currently in use. These improvements notwithstanding, the differences between the results produced by the current and by the proposed new methods generally are small because the relative uncertainties of the inputs are small and most contemporary load cells respond approximately linearly to such inputs. For this reason, there will be no compelling need to revise any of the force calibration reports previously issued by NIST.</p>
