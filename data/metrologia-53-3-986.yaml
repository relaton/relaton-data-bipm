    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper describes the influence of a constant curvature of the shakerâ€™s air bearing guidance on a low frequency primary accelerometer calibration. Based on the mathematical model, three different methods are developed that allow a quantitative evaluation of this disturbing effect and thus the correction of the resulting systematic deviation.</p>
    <p>All three methods are applied to the example of a primary low frequency accelerometer calibration performed at PTB, and the results are given in comparison to the original uncorrected magnitude of sensitivity results.</p>
