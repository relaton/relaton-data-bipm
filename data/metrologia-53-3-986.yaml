abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper describes the influence of a constant curvature of
    the shakerâ€™s air bearing guidance on a low frequency primary accelerometer calibration.
    Based on the mathematical model, three different methods are developed that allow
    a quantitative evaluation of this disturbing effect and thus the correction of
    the resulting systematic deviation.</p><p>All three methods are applied to the
    example of a primary low frequency accelerometer calibration performed at PTB,
    and the results are given in comparison to the original uncorrected magnitude
    of sensitivity results.</p>
