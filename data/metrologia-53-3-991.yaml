abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper is concerned with the names and symbols for quantities
    used to describe oscillatory motion such as for a harmonic oscillator, and the
    units to be used for the quantity plane angle and phase angle for an oscillator,
    and related quantities. I draw attention to the need to carefully distinguish
    the names and symbols for quantities from the names and symbols for their numerical
    values in any application, and the significance of including units such as radian
    and cycle for the quantity plane angle. The familiar equations for a harmonic
    oscillator such as ω  =  2πν, and the relation ħ  =  h/2π for the Planck constant,
    are shown to hold only if the symbols are taken to represent the dimensionless
    numerical values of the quantities concerned in particular units, rather than
    the actual values which are not dimensionless as generally used in the equations
    of physics. Alternative ways of handling these quantities and units are discussed.</p>
