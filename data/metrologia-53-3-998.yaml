abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The treatment of angles within the SI is anomalous compared
    with other quantities, and there is a case for removing this anomaly by declaring
    plane angle to be an additional base quantity within the system. It is shown that
    this could bring several benefits in terms of treating angle on an equal basis
    with other metrics, removing potentially harmful ambiguities, and bringing SI
    units more in line with concepts in basic physics, but at the expense of significant
    upheaval to familiar equations within mathematics and physics. This paper sets
    out the most important of these changes so that an alternative unit system containing
    angle as a base quantity can be seen in the round, irrespective of whether it
    is ever widely adopted. The alternative formulas and units can be treated as the
    underlying, more general equations of mathematical physics, independent of the
    units used for angle, which are conventionally simplified by implicitly assuming
    that the unit used for angle is the radian.</p>
