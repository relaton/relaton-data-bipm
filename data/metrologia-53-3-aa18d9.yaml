abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe an approach for creating a standard for the dynamic
    measurement of pressure based on the measurement of fundamental quantum properties
    of molecular systems. From the linewidth and intensities of ro-vibrational transitions
    we plan on making an accurate determination of pressure and temperature. The goal
    is to achieve an absolute uncertainty for time-varying pressure of 5% with a measurement
    rate of 100 kHz, which will in the future serve as a method for the traceable
    calibration of pressure sensors used in transient processes. To illustrate this
    concept we have used wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS), due to inherent
    advantages over direct absorption spectroscopy, to perform rapid measurements
    of carbon dioxide in order to determine the pressure. The system records the full
    lineshape profile of a single ro-vibrational transition of CO<sub>2</sub> at a
    repetition rate of 4 kHz and with a systematic measurement uncertainty of 12%
    for the linewidth measurement. A series of pressures were measured at a rate of
    400 Hz (10 averages) and from these measurements the linewidth was determined
    with a relative uncertainty of about 0.5% on average. The pressures measured using
    WMS have an average difference of 0.6% from the absolute pressure measured with
    a capacitance diaphragm sensor.</p>
