abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We are reporting on a laser-based absolute spectral responsivity
    scale in the mid-infrared spectral range. By using a mid-infrared tunable optical
    parametric oscillator as the laser source, the absolute responsivity scale has
    been established by calibrating thin-film thermopile detectors against an absolute
    cryogenic radiometer. The thin-film thermopile detectors can be then used as transfer
    standard detectors. The extended uncertainty of the absolute spectral responsivity
    measurement has been analyzed to be 0.58%–0.68% ( k   =  2).</p>
