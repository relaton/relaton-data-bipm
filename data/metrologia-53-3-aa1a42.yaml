abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The purpose of this mise en pratique, prepared by the Consultative
    Committee for Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) of the International Committee
    for Weights and Measures (CIPM) and formally adopted by the CIPM, is to provide
    guidance on how the candela and related units used in photometry and radiometry
    can be realized in practice. The scope of the mise en pratique recognizes the
    fact that the two fields of photometry and radiometry and their units are closely
    related through the current definition of the SI base unit for the photometric
    quantity, luminous intensity: the candela.</p><p>The previous version of the mise
    en pratique was applied only to the candela whereas this updated version covers
    the realization of the candela and other related units used for photometric and
    radiometric quantities. Recent advances in the generation and manipulation of
    individual photons show great promise of producing radiant fluxes with a well-established
    number of photons. Thus, this mise en pratique also includes information on the
    practical realization of units for photometric and radiometric quantities using
    photon-number-based techniques. In the following, for units used for photometric
    and radiometric quantities, the shorter term, photometric and radiometric units,
    is generally used.</p><p>Section 1 describes the definition of the candela which
    introduces a close relationship between photometric and radiometric units. Sections
    2 and 3 describe the practical realization of radiometric and photon-number-based
    units, respectively. Section 4.1 explains how, in general, photometric units are
    derived from radiometric units. Sections 4.2â€“4.5 deal with the particular geometric
    conditions for the specific photometric units. Section 5 deals very briefly with
    the topic of determination of measurement uncertainties in photometry.</p>'
