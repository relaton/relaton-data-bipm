abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The new 5 MN hexapod-shaped multicomponent build-up system (HSM-BUS)
    represents significant progress in the field of reference transducers in the high
    force range. As with any build-up system, the presented hexapod-shaped multicomponent
    force transducer can lead, not only to measure forces 5 times higher than the
    capacity of a each single uniaxial force transducer (UFT), but gives also information
    about the other components of the force vector and of the moment vector. Furthermore,
    the calibration of such types of multicomponent force transducer regards only
    the calibration of the signal outputs coming from each UFT and the calibration
    of the geometry of the system. In this work, an a priori evaluation of the expected
    uncertainty is performed. As a first approximation, the effects of the calibration
    uncertainties of UFTs and of the geometrical tolerances given on the construction
    drawing were considered. Subsequently, with a finite element simulation of the
    mechanical behavior of the 5 MN HSM-BUS under load, a mathematical model of elastic
    deformations has been evaluated and applied for evaluating and correcting the
    systematic errors due to the deformation of the geometry under load.</p>
