abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present details on the alignment and calibration of a goniometer
    assembly consisting two stacked, optically encoded, vertical axis rotation stages.
    A technique for its calibration is presented that utilizes a stable, uncalibrated,
    third stage to position a mirror in conjunction with a nulling autocollimator.
    Such a system provides a self-calibrating set of angular stages with absolute
    accuracy of  ±0.1 s of plane angle (k  =  2 expanded uncertainty) around the full
    circle, suitable for laboratory application. This calibration technique permits
    in situ, absolute angular calibration of an operational goniometer assembly that
    is requisite for fully traceable angle measurement, as the installation of the
    encoder is known to change its performance from the angular calibration data provided
    by the manufacturer.</p>
