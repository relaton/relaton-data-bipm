abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This paper describes the principle of a new fully automated
    digitally assisted coaxial bridge having a large bandwidth ranging from 60 Hz
    to 50 kHz. The performance of the bridge is evaluated making        1:  1       comparisons
    between calculable ac resistors. The agreement between the calculated and the
    measured frequency dependence of the resistors is better than        5  ⋅     10    −  8          at
    frequencies up to 5 kHz, better than        1  ⋅     10    −  7          up to
    20 kHz and better than        0.8  ⋅     10    −  6          up to 50 kHz. This
    bridge is particularly well suited to investigate the ac transport properties
    of graphene in the quantum Hall regime.</p>'
