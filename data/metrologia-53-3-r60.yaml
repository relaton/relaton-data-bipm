    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Discrete time control systems are widely used in time and frequency applications. Control systems can be designed to reduce phase and frequency offsets to a given reference either more or less aggressively depending on overall system needs. There are many methods available to aid in designing control systems, including techniques based on state space system models. Several state space control design methods will be shown. The control concepts covered in this paper are pole placement, minimum control effort, and linear quadratic Gaussian. The effects of steering limits on system performance will also be discussed.</p>
