abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>UTC(OP), the French national realization of the international
    coordinated universal time, was redesigned and rebuilt. The first step was the
    implementation in October 2012 of a new algorithm based on a H-maser and on atomic
    fountain data. Thanks to the new implementation, the stability of UTC(OP) was
    dramatically improved and UTC(OP) competes with the best time scales available
    today. Then the hardware generation and distribution of the UTC(OP) physical signals
    were replaced. Part of the new hardware is composed of commercial devices, but
    the key elements were specifically developed. One of them is a special switch
    that allows the UTC(OP) signals to be derived from one of two time scales, based
    on two different H-masers, which are generated simultaneously. This insures the
    continuity of the UTC(OP) signal even when a change of the reference H-maser is
    required. With the new hardware implementation, UTC(OP) is made available through
    three coherent signals: 100 MHz, 10 MHz and 1 PPS. For more than 3 years, UTC(OP)
    remained well below 10 ns close to UTC, with a difference even less than 5 ns
    if we except a short period around MJD 56650.</p>'
