abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This article presents the calibration of a system for measuring
    air flow velocity in a wind tunnel with a multiple-hole orifice. The comparative
    method was applied for the calibration. The method consists in equalising the
    air flow velocity in a test section of the tunnel with that of the hot-wire anemometer
    probe which should then read zero value. The hot-wire anemometer probe moves reciprocally
    in the tunnel test section with a constant velocity, aligned and opposite to the
    air velocity. Air velocity in the tunnel test section is adjusted so that the
    minimum values of a periodic hot-wire anemometer signal displayed on an oscilloscope
    screen reach the lowest position (the minimum method). A sinusoidal component
    can be superimposed to the probe constant velocity. Then, the air flow velocity
    in the tunnel test section is adjusted so that, when the probe moves in the direction
    of air flow, only the second harmonic of the periodically variable velocity superimposed
    on the constant velocity (second harmonic method) remains at the output of the
    low-pass filter to which the hot-wire anemometer signal, displayed on the oscilloscope
    screen, is supplied. The velocity of the uniform motion of the hot-wire anemometer
    probe is measured with a magnetic linear encoder.</p><p>The calibration of the
    system for the measurement of low air velocities in the wind tunnel was performed
    in the following steps:</p><p>1. Calibration of the linear encoder for the measurement
    of the uniform motion velocity of the hot-wire anemometer probe in the test section
    of the tunnel.</p><p>2. Calibration of the system for measurement of low air velocities
    with a multiple-hole orifice for the velocities of 0.1 and 0.25 m s<sup>âˆ’1</sup>:</p><p>-
    (a) measurement of the probe movement velocity setting;</p><p>- (b) measurement
    of air velocity in the tunnel test section with comparison according to the second
    harmonic method;</p><p>- (c) measurement of air velocity in the tunnel with comparison
    according to the minimum method.</p><p>The calibration uncertainties were calculated
    after the measurements.</p>
