abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function
    (BRDF) is the key quantity to specify the spectral reflectance of materials for
    any condition of irradiation and detection, and its characterization is quite
    important for surfaces with a high dependence on these conditions, such as iridescent
    coatings. In order to evaluate the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMC)
    of National Metrology Institutes with the ability to measure the spectral BRDF,
    a case study interlaboratory comparison is in progress. Spectral BRDF has both
    spectral and geometric dependence, and this multidimensionality must be treated
    in the comparison to provide useful information to the participants about their
    CMCs. A data analysis method for the comparison is presented in this work, which
    was tested by simulations for different scenarios. The proposed method assesses
    whether the experimental data from each participant are consistent with those
    from the others. Finally, one-dimensional and multidimensional degrees of equivalence
    are defined, which should allow systematic deviations of spectral and geometric
    nature to be identified.</p>
