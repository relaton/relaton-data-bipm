    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The PTB’s (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany) nanonewton force facility, first presented in work by Nesterov (2007 <italic>Meas. Sci. Technol</italic>. <bold>18</bold> 360–6), Nesterov (2009 <italic>Meas. Sci. Technol</italic>. <bold>20</bold> 084012) and Nesterov <italic>et al</italic> (2009 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>46</bold> 277–82), has been significantly improved and used to measure the stiffness of a cantilever. The facility is based on a disc pendulum with electrostatic reduction of its deflection and stiffness. In this paper, we will demonstrate that the facility is able to measure horizontal forces in the range below 1 μN with a resolution below 5 pN and an uncertainty below 2.7% for a measured force of 1 nN at a measurement duration of about 20 s. We will demonstrate the possibility of using this facility as a calibration device that can accurately determine spring constants of soft cantilevers (<italic>K</italic> ≲ 0.1 N m<sup>−1</sup>) with traceability to the SI units. The method and the results of measuring the spring constant of a soft cantilever (<italic>K</italic>  =  0.125 N m<sup>−1</sup>) in air, in a medium vacuum, in a high vacuum and in nitrogen are presented. We will show that a relative standard uncertainty of the spring constant calibration of better than 0.3% (measurement in a medium vacuum) and a repeatability of better than 0.04% are achieved.</p>
