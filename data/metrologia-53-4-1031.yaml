abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The PTB’s (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany) nanonewton
    force facility, first presented in work by Nesterov (2007 Meas. Sci. Technol.
    18 360–6), Nesterov (2009 Meas. Sci. Technol. 20 084012) and Nesterov et al (2009
    Metrologia 46 277–82), has been significantly improved and used to measure the
    stiffness of a cantilever. The facility is based on a disc pendulum with electrostatic
    reduction of its deflection and stiffness. In this paper, we will demonstrate
    that the facility is able to measure horizontal forces in the range below 1 μN
    with a resolution below 5 pN and an uncertainty below 2.7% for a measured force
    of 1 nN at a measurement duration of about 20 s. We will demonstrate the possibility
    of using this facility as a calibration device that can accurately determine spring
    constants of soft cantilevers (K ≲ 0.1 N m<sup>−1</sup>) with traceability to
    the SI units. The method and the results of measuring the spring constant of a
    soft cantilever (K  =  0.125 N m<sup>−1</sup>) in air, in a medium vacuum, in
    a high vacuum and in nitrogen are presented. We will show that a relative standard
    uncertainty of the spring constant calibration of better than 0.3% (measurement
    in a medium vacuum) and a repeatability of better than 0.04% are achieved.</p>
