abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper describes a Josephson-based full digital impedance
    bridge capable of comparing any two impedances, regardless of type (R-C, R-L,
    or L-C), over a large frequency range (from 1 kHz to 20 kHz). At the heart of
    the bridge are two Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer systems that offer
    unprecedented flexibility in high-precision impedance calibration, that is, it
    can compare impedances with arbitrary ratios and phase angles. Thus this single
    bridge can fully cover the entire complex plane. In the near future, this type
    of instrument will considerably simplify the realization and maintenance of the
    various impedance scales in many National Metrology Institutes around the world.</p>
