abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The watt balance relates force or mass to the Planck constant
    h, the metre and the second. It enables the forthcoming redefinition of the unit
    of mass within the SI by measuring the Planck constant in terms of mass, length
    and time with an uncertainty of better than 2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. To achieve
    this, existing watt balances require complex and time-consuming alignment adjustments
    limiting their use to a few national metrology laboratories. This paper describes
    a simplified construction and operating principle for a watt balance which eliminates
    the need for the majority of these adjustments and is readily scalable using either
    electromagnetic or electrostatic actuators. It is hoped that this will encourage
    the more widespread use of the technique for a wide range of measurements of force
    or mass. For example: thrust measurements for space applications which would require
    only measurements of electrical quantities and velocity/displacement.</p>'
