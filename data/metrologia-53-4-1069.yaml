abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>At the present time, transfer and verification standards of
    transmission coefficient (or, equivalently, transmission loss) are not readily
    available at high millimetre-wave frequencies (i.e. at frequencies ranging typically
    from 100 GHz to 300 GHz). In recent years, cross-connected waveguide devices have
    been proposed to provide calculable standards of transmission loss at these frequencies.
    This paper investigates the viability of these cross-connected waveguides as transfer
    standards of transmission for inter-laboratory measurement comparison exercises.
    This relates to their potential use in activities such as international key comparison
    exercises and measurement audit programmes. A trial inter-laboratory comparison
    involving four laboratories using two cross-connected waveguides in the WR-05
    waveguide size (covering frequencies from 140 GHz to 220 GHz) is described and
    includes an analysis of the measurement results obtained during the comparison
    exercise.</p>
