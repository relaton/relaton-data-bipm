    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>At the present time, transfer and verification standards of transmission coefficient (or, equivalently, transmission loss) are not readily available at high millimetre-wave frequencies (i.e. at frequencies ranging typically from 100 GHz to 300 GHz). In recent years, cross-connected waveguide devices have been proposed to provide calculable standards of transmission loss at these frequencies. This paper investigates the viability of these cross-connected waveguides as transfer standards of transmission for inter-laboratory measurement comparison exercises. This relates to their potential use in activities such as international key comparison exercises and measurement audit programmes. A trial inter-laboratory comparison involving four laboratories using two cross-connected waveguides in the WR-05 waveguide size (covering frequencies from 140 GHz to 220 GHz) is described and includes an analysis of the measurement results obtained during the comparison exercise.</p>
