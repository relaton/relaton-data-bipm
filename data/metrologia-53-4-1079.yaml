abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International Association for the Properties of Water and
    Steam (IAPWS) has published a set of empirical reference equations of state, forming
    the basis of the 2010 Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater (TEOS-10), from which
    all thermodynamic properties of seawater, ice, and humid air can be derived in
    a thermodynamically consistent manner. For each of the equations of state, the
    parameters have been found by simultaneously fitting equations for a range of
    different derived quantities using large sets of measurements of these quantities.
    In some cases, uncertainties in these fitted equations have been assigned based
    on the uncertainties of the measurement results. However, because uncertainties
    in the parameter values have not been determined, it is not possible to estimate
    the uncertainty in many of the useful quantities that can be calculated using
    the parameters. In this paper we demonstrate how the method of generalised least
    squares (GLS), in which the covariance of the input data is propagated into the
    values calculated by the fitted equation, and in particular into the covariance
    matrix of the fitted parameters, can be applied to one of the TEOS-10 equations
    of state, namely IAPWS-95 for fluid pure water. Using the calculated parameter
    covariance matrix, we provide some preliminary estimates of the uncertainties
    in derived quantities, namely the second and third virial coefficients for water.
    We recommend further investigation of the GLS method for use as a standard method
    for calculating and propagating the uncertainties of values computed from empirical
    equations.</p>
