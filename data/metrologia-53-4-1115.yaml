abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A comparison down to sub-100-fW optical power level was carried
    out between a low-noise Silicon photodiode and a low optical flux measurement
    facility based on a double attenuator technique. The comparison was carried out
    via a silicon single-photon avalanche diode (Si-SPAD), which acted as transfer
    standard. The measurements were performed at a wavelength of 770 nm using an attenuated
    laser as a radiation source at optical power levels between approximately 86 fW
    and approximately 1325 fW, corresponding to approximately 330 000 photons s<sup>−1</sup>
    and approximately 5.2  ×  10<sup>6</sup> photons s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
    The mean relative deviation of the detection efficiencies of the Si-SPAD, determined
    by the Si-photodiode and the low optical flux measurement facility, i.e. between
    two completely independent traceability routes, was  &lt;  0.2%, thus well within
    the combined standard uncertainty of the two measurements. To our knowledge, this
    is the first comparison for the detection efficiency of a single photon detector
    using a direct optical flux measurement by a conventional Si-photodiode at such
    low power levels.</p>
