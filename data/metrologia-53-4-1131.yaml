abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Unilateral degrees of equivalence are the key result in the
    analysis of key comparison data and they are used to approve, or disapprove, calibration
    and measurement capabilities of the participating laboratories. To this end, it
    is checked whether a degree of equivalence differs significantly from zero. Proceeding
    in such a way can be viewed as carrying out a classical hypothesis test. We develop
    a Bayesian counterpart to this approach which has the advantage that it can include
    prior assessment of the corresponding Consultative Committee about the calibration
    and measurement capabilities of the participating laboratories. Simple expressions
    are derived and their implementation is provided in terms of MATLAB<sup>®</sup>
    and R programs. The novel procedure is illustrated by its application to two recent
    key comparisons CCL-K1 and CCM.FF-K4.1.2011.</p>
