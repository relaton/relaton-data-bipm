abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The value of the Planck constant h was determined in 2014 by
    means of the LNE watt balance experiment. The relative standard uncertainty was
    31 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. This first determination was performed in air with
    a 500 g mass standard made from XSH Alacrite. The main uncertainty components
    in air associated with the mass involve the calibration, the mass stability, the
    buoyancy correction and the magnetic interaction correction. The combined relative
    uncertainty due to the mass is 7.2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. The use in 2016 of
    a mass standard made from platinum iridium alloy significantly reduces the component
    of uncertainty arising from the mass standard for a Planck constant measurement
    either in air or under vacuum. The relative uncertainty due to this contribution
    is estimated to be about 3 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> in air and one part in 10<sup>8</sup>
    under vacuum. The future system for the dissemination of the mass unit using the
    LNE watt balance will be based on a primary realization with three 500 g mass
    standards made from platinum–iridium alloy, pure iridium and Udimet 720 respectively,
    coupled with a pool of kilograms made from different materials. Pure iridium and
    Udimet 720 are new materials to make reference mass standards proposed by CNAM
    and LNE respectively and have never been used by any NMI for manufacturing mass
    standards until now. Some new results concerning their surface behavior are given.</p>
