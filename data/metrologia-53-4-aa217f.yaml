abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A knowledge of the effect of impurities at the level of parts
    per million on the freezing temperature of very pure metals is essential for realisation
    of ITS-90 fixed points. New information has become available for use with the
    thermodynamic modelling software MTDATA, permitting calculation of liquidus slopes,
    in the low concentration limit, of a wider range of binary alloy systems than
    was previously possible. In total, calculated values for 536 binary systems are
    given. In addition, new experimental determinations of phase diagrams, in the
    low impurity concentration limit, have recently appeared. All available data have
    been combined to provide a comprehensive set of liquidus slopes for impurities
    in ITS-90 metal fixed points. In total, liquidus slopes for 838 systems are tabulated
    for the fixed points Hg, Ga, In, Sn, Zn, Al, Ag, Au, and Cu. It is shown that
    the value of the liquidus slope as a function of impurity element atomic number
    can be approximated using a simple formula, and good qualitative agreement with
    the existing data is observed for the fixed points Al, Ag, Au and Cu, but curiously
    the formula is not applicable to the fixed points Hg, Ga, In, Sn, and Zn. Some
    discussion is made concerning the influence of oxygen on the liquidus slopes,
    and some calculations using MTDATA are discussed. The BIPMâ€™s consultative committee
    for thermometry has long recognised that the sum of individual estimates method
    is the ideal approach for assessing uncertainties due to impurities, but the community
    has been largely powerless to use the model due to lack of data. Here, not only
    is data provided, but a simple model is given to enable known thermophysical data
    to be used directly to estimate impurity effects for a large fraction of the ITS-90
    fixed points.</p>
