abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe an apparatus for traceable, dynamic calibration
    of force transducers using harmonic excitation, and report calibration measurements
    of force transducers using this apparatus. In this system, the force applied to
    the transducer is produced by the acceleration of an attached mass, and is determined
    according to Newton’s second law, F  =  ma. The acceleration is measured by primary
    means, using laser interferometry. The capabilities of this system are demonstrated
    by performing dynamic calibrations of two shear-web-type force transducers up
    to a frequency of 2 kHz, with an expanded uncertainty below 1.2%. We give an account
    of all significant sources of uncertainty, including a detailed consideration
    of the effects of dynamic tilting (rocking), which is a leading source of uncertainty
    in such harmonic force calibration systems.</p>
