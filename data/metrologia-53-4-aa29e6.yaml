abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper deals with an uncertainty analysis of gas flow measurements
    using a compact, high-speed, clearance-sealed realization of a piston prover.
    A detailed methodology for the uncertainty analysis, covering the components due
    to the gas density, dimensional and time measurements, the leakage flow, the density
    correction factor and the repeatability, is presented. The paper also deals with
    the selection of the isothermal and adiabatic measurement models, the treatment
    of the leakage flow and discusses the need for averaging multiple consecutive
    readings of the piston prover. The analysis is prepared for the flow range (50 000:1)
    covered by the three interchangeable flow cells. The results show that using the
    adiabatic measurement model and averaging the multiple readings, the estimated
    expanded measurement uncertainty of the gas mass flow rate is less than 0.15%
    in the flow range above 0.012 g min<sup>−1</sup>, whereas it increases for lower
    mass flow rates due to the leakage flow related effects. At the upper end of the
    measuring range, using the adiabatic instead of the isothermal measurement model,
    as well as averaging multiple readings, proves important.</p>
