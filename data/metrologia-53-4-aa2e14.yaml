abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Optical lattice clocks are at the forefront of frequency metrology.
    Both the instability and systematic uncertainty of these clocks have been reported
    to be two orders of magnitude smaller than the best microwave clocks. For this
    reason, a redefinition of the SI second based on optical clocks seems possible
    in the near future. However, the operation of optical lattice clocks has not yet
    reached the reliability that microwave clocks have achieved so far. In this paper,
    we report on the operation of a strontium optical lattice clock that spans several
    weeks, with more than 80% uptime. We make use of this long integration time to
    demonstrate a reproducible measurement of frequency ratios between the strontium
    clock transition and microwave Cs primary and Rb secondary frequency standards.</p>
