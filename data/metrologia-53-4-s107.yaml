abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measurement uncertainty is a measure of the quality of a measurement;
    it enables users of measurements to manage the risks and costs associated with
    decisions influenced by measurements, and it supports metrological traceability
    by quantifying the proximity of measurement results to true SI values. The Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) ensures uncertainty statements
    meet these purposes and encourages the world-wide harmony of measurement uncertainty
    practice. Although the GUM is an extraordinarily successful document, it has flaws,
    and a revision has been proposed. Like the already-published supplements to the
    GUM, the proposed revision employs objective Bayesian statistics instead of frequentist
    statistics. This paper argues that the move away from a frequentist treatment
    of measurement error to a Bayesian treatment of states of knowledge is misguided.
    The move entails changes in measurement philosophy, a change in the meaning of
    probability, and a change in the object of uncertainty analysis, all leading to
    different numerical results, increased costs, increased confusion, a loss of trust,
    and, most significantly, a loss of harmony with current practice. Recommendations
    are given for a revision in harmony with the current GUM and allowing all forms
    of statistical inference.</p>
