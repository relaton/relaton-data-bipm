abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The measurement of quantities with time-dependent values is
    a common task in many areas of metrology. Although well established techniques
    are available for the analysis of such measurements, serious scientific challenges
    remain to be solved to enable their routine use in metrology. In this paper we
    focus on the challenge of estimating a time-dependent measurand when the relationship
    between the value of the measurand and the indication is modeled by a convolution.
    Mathematically, deconvolution is an ill-posed inverse problem, requiring regularization
    to stabilize the inversion in the presence of noise. We present and discuss deconvolution
    in three practical applications: thrust-balance, ultra-fast sampling oscilloscopes
    and hydrophones. Each case study takes a different approach to modeling the convolution
    process and regularizing its inversion. Critically, all three examples lack the
    assignment of an uncertainty to the influence of the regularization on the estimation
    accuracy. This is a grand challenge for dynamic metrology, for which to date no
    generic solution exists. The case studies presented here cover a wide range of
    time scales and prior knowledge about the measurand, and they can thus serve as
    starting points for future developments in metrology. The aim of this work is
    to present the case studies and demonstrate the challenges they pose for metrology.</p>'
