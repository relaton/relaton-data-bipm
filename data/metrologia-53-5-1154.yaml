abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The frequency noise and intensity noise of a laser set the performance
    limits in many modern photonics applications and, consequently, must often be
    characterized. As lasers continue to improve, the measurement of these noises
    however becomes increasingly challenging. Current approaches for the characterization
    of very high-performance lasers often call for a second laser with equal or higher
    performance to the one that is to be measured, an incoherent interferometer having
    an extremely long delay-arm, or an interferometer that relies on an active device.
    These instrumental features can be impractical or problematic under certain experimental
    conditions. As an alternative, this paper presents an entirely passive coherent
    interferometer that employs an optical 90° hybrid coupler to perform in-phase
    and quadrature detection. We demonstrate the technique by measuring the frequency
    noise power spectral density of a highly-stable 192 THz (1560 nm) fiber laser
    over five frequency decades. Simultaneously, we are able to measure its relative
    intensity noise power spectral density and characterize the correlation between
    its amplitude noise and phase noise. We correct some common misconceptions through
    a detailed theoretical analysis and demonstrate the necessity to account for normal
    imperfections of the optical 90° hybrid coupler. We finally conclude that this
    passive coherent discriminator is suitable for reliable and simple noise characterization
    of highly-stable lasers, with bandwidth and dynamic range benefits but susceptibility
    to additive noise contamination.</p>
