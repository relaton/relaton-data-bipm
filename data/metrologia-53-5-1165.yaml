abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A torque-generating measuring device in the 1 MN force standard
    machine of Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt allows combined load conditions
    to be generated. Superposition is possible in measuring ranges from 20 kN to 1
    MN for axial load and from 20 N · m to 2 kN · m for torque. The measurement facility
    is unique in the world and offers the opportunity to characterize multi-component
    sensors specifically with regard to their signal crosstalk. The expanded relative
    measurement uncertainty (k  =  2) of the axial force is 2 · 10<sup>−5</sup>. In
    the following, the technical details of the torque measuring device and the metrological
    characterization from the modelling to the measurement uncertainty budget will
    be described. The model provides an expanded relative measurement uncertainty
    (k  =  2)  &lt;  3.9 · 10<sup>−4</sup>. The results of comparison measurements
    will be discussed.</p>
