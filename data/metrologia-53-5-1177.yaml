abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Currently, the piston-cylinder assembly known as PG39 is used
    as a primary pressure standard at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) in the range of 20 kPa to 1 MPa with a standard uncertainty of 3×10−6 as
    evaluated in 2006. An approximate model of gas flow through the crevice between
    the piston and sleeve contributed significantly to this uncertainty. The aim of
    this work is to revise the previous effective cross sectional area of PG39 and
    its uncertainty by carrying out more exact calculations that consider the effects
    of rarefied gas flow. The effective cross sectional area is completely determined
    by the pressure distribution in the crevice. Once the pressure distribution is
    known, the elastic deformations of both piston and sleeve are calculated by finite
    element analysis. Then, the pressure distribution is recalculated iteratively
    for the new crevice dimension. As a result, a new value of the effective area
    is obtained with a relative difference of 3×10−6 from the previous one. Moreover,
    this approach allows us to reduce significantly the standard uncertainty related
    to the gas flow model so that the total uncertainty is decreased by a factor of
    three.</p>
