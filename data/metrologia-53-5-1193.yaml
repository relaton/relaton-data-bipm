abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Chemical purity assessment using quantitative<sup>1</sup>H-nuclear
    magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a method based on ratio references of mass
    and signal intensity of the analyte species to that of chemical standards of known
    purity. As such, it is an example of a calculation using a known measurement equation
    with multiple inputs. Though multiple samples are often analyzed during purity
    evaluations in order to assess measurement repeatability, the uncertainty evaluation
    must also account for contributions from inputs to the measurement equation. Furthermore,
    there may be other uncertainty components inherent in the experimental design,
    such as independent implementation of multiple calibration standards. As such,
    the uncertainty evaluation is not purely bottom up (based on the measurement equation)
    or top down (based on the experimental design), but inherently contains elements
    of both. This hybrid form of uncertainty analysis is readily implemented with
    Bayesian statistical analysis. In this article we describe this type of analysis
    in detail and illustrate it using data from an evaluation of chemical purity and
    its uncertainty for a folic acid material.</p>
