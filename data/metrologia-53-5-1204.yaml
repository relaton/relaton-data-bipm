abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In 2014 the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)
    carried out a calibration campaign using the international prototype of the kilogram
    (IPK). This is the second part in a series of publications describing the results
    of that campaign. As reported (Metrologia 52 310–6), following the comparisons
    between the IPK and its official copies, it was found that the BIPM ‘as-maintained
    mass unit’ was offset by 35 μg from the mass of the IPK in 2014. We report here
    the results of an investigation into this offset that has considered all data
    available from internal BIPM mass comparisons carried out between 1992 and 2014.
    This has enabled us to model the evolution of the offset in the as-maintained
    mass unit and to identify some possible reasons why it has developed. We also
    report how the model has been used to estimate corrections to all 1 kg mass calibration
    certificates issued by the BIPM during this period.</p>
