    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In 2014 the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) carried out a calibration campaign using the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK). This is the second part in a series of publications describing the results of that campaign. As reported (<italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold><ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/52/2/310" xlink:type="simple">52</ext-link></bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/52/2/310" xlink:type="simple">310</ext-link>–<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0026-1394/52/2/310" xlink:type="simple">6</ext-link>), following the comparisons between the IPK and its official copies, it was found that the BIPM ‘as-maintained mass unit’ was offset by 35 μg from the mass of the IPK in 2014. We report here the results of an investigation into this offset that has considered all data available from internal BIPM mass comparisons carried out between 1992 and 2014. This has enabled us to model the evolution of the offset in the as-maintained mass unit and to identify some possible reasons why it has developed. We also report how the model has been used to estimate corrections to all 1 kg mass calibration certificates issued by the BIPM during this period.</p>
