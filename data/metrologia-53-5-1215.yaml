abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For highest accuracy fluorescence colorimetry, standardizing
    organizations recommend the use of a two-monochromator method with a bidirectional
    illumination and viewing geometry (45:0 or 0:45). For this reason, reference fluorescence
    instruments developed by National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) have largely conformed
    to this bidirectional geometry. However, for many practical applications in colorimetry
    where the samples exhibit texture, surface roughness or other spatial non-uniformities,
    the relevant standard test methods specify a sphere geometry with diffuse illumination
    or viewing (e.g. d:8 or 8:d) which gives improved measurement precision. This
    difference in the measurement geometry between the primary instrument used to
    realize the fluorescence scale and the secondary testing instruments used for
    practical measurements, compromises the traceability of these fluorescence calibrations.
    To address this metrology issue, a two-monochromator goniospectrofluorimeter instrument
    has been developed at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). This instrument
    can be configured for different illumination and viewing geometries to conform
    with international standards for different colorimetric applications. To improve
    the traceability chain for measurements using different geometries, the instrument
    has been thoroughly characterized and validated by means of comparison measurements
    with NRC’s other spectrophotometric and fluorescence reference instruments. This
    uncertainty analysis has been carried out in a step-wise manner; first, for a
    bidirectional geometry (45:0) and then for a sphere geometry (8:d) to provide
    an uninterrupted traceability to primary radiometric scales. The first paper in
    this two paper series reviews the background to this work and provides details
    of the basic design of the new instrument and its characterization for measurements
    using a bidirectional geometry (45:0), including a representative uncertainty
    budget. In part 2, the major sources of sphere error are described and minimized
    in a modified sphere design. The instrument characterization and validation are
    then extended to a sphere geometry (8:d) to provide direct traceability for practical
    fluorescence colorimetry.</p>
