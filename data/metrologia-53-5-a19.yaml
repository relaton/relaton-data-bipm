abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When the kilogram is redefined in terms of the fixed numerical
    value of the Planck constant h, the x-ray-crystal-density (XRCD) method, among
    others, is used for realizing the redefined kilogram. The XRCD method has been
    used for the determination of the Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub> by counting
    the number of atoms in a<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal, contributing to a substantial
    reduction of uncertainty in the values of N<sub>A</sub> and h to 2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.
    This method can be therefore used reversely for the mass determination of a 1â€‰kg
    sphere prepared from the crystal. This is realized by SI-traceable measurements
    of its lattice parameter, isotopic composition, volume, and surface properties.
    Details of the corresponding measurements are provided, as well as the concept
    of the XRCD method, isotope enrichment, crystal production, sphere manufacturing,
    and evaluation of impurities and self-point defects in the crystal, together with
    mass comparison with respect to the silicon sphere for disseminating mass standards.</p>
