abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The redefinition of the SI unit of mass in terms of a fixed
    value of the Planck constant has been made possible by the Kibble balance, previously
    known as the watt balance. Once the new definition has been adopted, the Kibble
    balance technique will permit the realisation of the mass unit over a range from
    milligrams to kilograms. We describe the theory underlying the Kibble balance
    and practical techniques required to construct such an instrument to relate a
    macroscopic physical mass to the Planck constant with an uncertainty, which is
    achievable at present, in the region of 2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. A number of
    Kibble balances have either been built or are under construction and we compare
    the principal features of these balances.</p>
