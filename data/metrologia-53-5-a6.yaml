    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The redefinition of the kilogram, expected to be approved in the autumn of 2018, will replace the artefact definition of the kilogram by assigning a fixed numerical value to a fundamental constant of physics. While the concept of such a change is pleasing, the mass community as represented by the Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM) was faced with a number of technical and procedural challenges that needed to be met in order to profit in any meaningful way from the proposed change. In the following, we outline these challenges and how the CCM has met and is meeting them. We focus especially on what the mass community requires of the new definition and the process by which the CCM has sought to ensure that these needs will be met.</p>
