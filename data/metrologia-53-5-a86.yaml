abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Although mass is typically defined within the International
    System of Units (SI) at the kilogram level, the pending SI redefinition provides
    an opportunity to realize mass at any scale using electrical metrology. We propose
    the use of an electromechanical balance to realize mass at the milligram level
    using SI electrical units. An integrated concentric-cylinder vacuum gap capacitor
    allows us to leverage the highly precise references available for capacitance,
    voltage and length to generate an electrostatic reference force. Weighing experiments
    performed on 1 mg and 20 mg artifacts show the same or lower uncertainty than
    similar experiments performed by subdividing the kilogram. The measurement is
    currently limited by the stability of the materials that compose the mass artifacts
    and the changes in adsorbed layers on the artifact surfaces as they are transferred
    from vacuum to air.</p>
