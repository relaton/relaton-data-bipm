abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The redefinition of the kilogram, along with another three of
    the base units of the International System of Units (SI), is scheduled for 2018.
    The current definition of the SI unit of mass assigns a mass of exactly one kilogram
    to the International Prototype of the kilogram, which is maintained in air and
    from which the unit is disseminated. The new definition, which will be from the
    Planck constant, involves the realisation of the mass unit in vacuum by the watt
    balance or Avogadro experiments. Thus, for the effective dissemination of the
    mass unit from the primary realisation experiments to end users, traceability
    of mass standards transferred between vacuum and air needs to be established and
    the associated uncertainties well understood. This paper describes a means of
    achieving the link between a unit realised in vacuum and standards used in air,
    and the ways in which their use can be optimised. It also investigates the likely
    uncertainty contribution introduced by the vacuum–air transfer process.</p>
