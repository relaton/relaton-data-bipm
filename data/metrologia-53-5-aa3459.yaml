abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The ratio h/mu between the Planck constant and the unified atomic
    mass constant should have a special status in the framework of the future international
    system of units. Currently (before the redefinition), this ratio allowed the comparison
    between determinations of h (watt balance) and determinations of mu (the XRCD
    method). In the future SI, as the Planck constant h will be fixed, the ratio h/mu
    will ensure the realization of the new kilogram (quantum kilogram) at the atomic
    scale. Furthermore as the Avogadro constant will be fixed, the carbon molar mass
    M(<sup>12</sup>C), which will no longer be equal to 12 g⋅mol−1, will be determined
    from m<sub>u</sub>. This ratio is also key data for the realization of the kilogram
    at the macroscopic scale using the XRCD method.</p><p>In this paper we present
    the state of the art on experiments that provide the most precise value of the
    ratio h/mu. We focus on the one that is based on the measurement of the atomic
    recoil due to the photon momentum.</p>
