abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Using a watt balance and a frequency comb, a mass-energy equivalence
    is derived. The watt balance compares mechanical power measured in terms of the
    meter, the second, and the kilogram to electrical power measured in terms of the
    volt and the ohm. A direct link between mechanical action and the Planck constant
    is established by the practical realization of the electrical units derived from
    the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects. By using frequency combs to measure
    velocities and acceleration of gravity, the unit of mass can be realized from
    a set of three defining constants: the Planck constant  h, the speed of light  c,
    and the hyperfine splitting frequency of<sup>133</sup>Cs.</p>'
