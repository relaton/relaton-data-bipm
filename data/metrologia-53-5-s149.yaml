abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The contents of the current edition, JCGM 100:2008, of the Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and its Supplements are
    reviewed and remarks made concerning a proposed revision of the GUM. A committee
    draft of the revision was circulated to member organizations of the Joint Committee
    for Guides in Metrology (JCGM) and all national metrology institutes in December
    2014. The motivation for the proposed changes is given and reactions to the committee
    draft are summarized. Some of the contents of this paper are solely an expression
    by the authors and do not constitute an official statement by the JCGM.</p>
