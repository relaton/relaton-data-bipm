    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We investigate the comparison method and the substitution method of integrating sphere-based relative methods for reflection measurements. Through an analytical description, we compare the two methods with a focus on the effects of a sphere: to determine reflectance without any correction on a sphere, the substitution method requires symmetry of a sphere in addition to the requirement of the comparison method, either uniformity of a sphere or equal reflectance distribution between a sample and a reference. We experimentally compare the two methods through reflection measurements of gray-scale diffuse samples with reflectance of 10%, 40%, and 99%, which results in agreement within their measurement uncertainties. Also, we observe a reflectance change depending on sample location on a sphere in the substitution type measurements, which is attributed to sphereâ€™s lack of symmetry. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of measurement uncertainty and reflection properties including bidirectional reflectance distribution function.</p>
