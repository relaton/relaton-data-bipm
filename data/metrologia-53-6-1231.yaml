abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We investigate the comparison method and the substitution method
    of integrating sphere-based relative methods for reflection measurements. Through
    an analytical description, we compare the two methods with a focus on the effects
    of a sphere: to determine reflectance without any correction on a sphere, the
    substitution method requires symmetry of a sphere in addition to the requirement
    of the comparison method, either uniformity of a sphere or equal reflectance distribution
    between a sample and a reference. We experimentally compare the two methods through
    reflection measurements of gray-scale diffuse samples with reflectance of 10%,
    40%, and 99%, which results in agreement within their measurement uncertainties.
    Also, we observe a reflectance change depending on sample location on a sphere
    in the substitution type measurements, which is attributed to sphereâ€™s lack of
    symmetry. The experimental results are analyzed in terms of measurement uncertainty
    and reflection properties including bidirectional reflectance distribution function.</p>'
