abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Currently, the determination of the internal absorbed dose to
    tissue from an administered radionuclide solution relies on Monte Carlo (MC) calculations
    based on published nuclear decay data, such as emission probabilities and energies.
    In order to validate these methods with measurements, it is necessary to achieve
    the required traceability of the internal absorbed dose measurements of a radionuclide
    solution to a primary standard of absorbed dose. The purpose of this work was
    to develop a suitable primary standard. A comparison between measurements and
    calculations of absorbed dose allows the validation of the internal radiation
    dose assessment methods.</p><p>The absorbed dose from an yttrium-90 chloride (<sup>90</sup>YCl)
    solution was measured with an extrapolation chamber. A phantom was developed at
    the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), the UK’s National Measurement Institute,
    to position the extrapolation chamber as closely as possible to the surface of
    the solution. The performance of the extrapolation chamber was characterised and
    a full uncertainty budget for the absorbed dose determination was obtained. Absorbed
    dose to air in the collecting volume of the chamber was converted to absorbed
    dose at the centre of the radionuclide solution by applying a MC calculated correction
    factor. This allowed a direct comparison of the analytically calculated and experimentally
    determined absorbed dose of an<sup>90</sup>YCl solution.</p><p>The relative standard
    uncertainty in the measurement of absorbed dose at the centre of an<sup>90</sup>YCl
    solution with the extrapolation chamber was found to be 1.6% (k  =  1). The calculated<sup>90</sup>Y
    absorbed doses from published medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) and radiation
    dose assessment resource (RADAR) data agreed with measurements to within 1.5%
    and 1.4%, respectively. This study has shown that it is feasible to use an extrapolation
    chamber for performing primary standard absorbed dose measurements of an unsealed
    radionuclide solution. Internal radiation dose assessment methods based on MIRD
    and RADAR data for<sup>90</sup>Y have been validated with experimental absorbed
    dose determination and they agree within the stated expanded uncertainty (k  =  2).</p>
