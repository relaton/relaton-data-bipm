abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A simple method is proposed for the evaluation of comparative
    measurements when closed measurement loops are present in the data. Using a graph
    theory representation of the data a basis for the residual subspace is readily
    identified that together with loop closure values provide the input to a matrix
    equation of the same rank as the number of independent loops in the graph. As
    an example, ultra-high-precision frequency ratio measurements including optical
    standards are considered and small corrections to the experimental data are derived,
    yielding a list of consistent frequency ratios for work on precision frequency
    standards and discussions relating to a possible future redefinition of the SI
    second.</p>
