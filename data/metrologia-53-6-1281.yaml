abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In the referenced paper, Ian Mills addresses the confusion
    caused by the treatment of plane angle in the International System of Units (SI).
    As he points out, what the SI calls an ‘angle’ is not a dimensional physical quantity
    but, rather, the dimensionless numerical value of the angle when expressed in
    radians, thus creating widespread confusion regarding terminology and notation.
    For example, Mills shows that for the harmonic oscillator, if the conventional
    argument of the sinusoid represents an angle, it must be divided by a dimensional
    constant equal to one radian in order to correctly render it dimensionless, thereby
    greatly clarifying the notation. However, there is a problem with the author’s
    interpretation of frequency. Although, for uniform rotation, Mills correctly defines
    the revolution frequency as the number of complete revolutions, N, divided by
    the time interval, he takes the unit for N to be ‘cycle’ (which he defines as
    one revolution) rather than the correct unit: the number one. The unit for ‘frequency’
    then appears to be ‘cycle per second’ (i.e. revolution per second), whereas it
    should be one per second, correctly called hertz. Thus Mills concludes that ‘frequency’
    is the same physical quantity as angular velocity and calls for the ‘hertz’ to
    be redefined as 2π rad s<sup>−1</sup>, a non-coherent derived unit for angular
    velocity. This misinterpretation of frequency corrupts the remainder of the author’s
    discussion of the examples considered.</p><p>In my comment, I explain and correct
    these and related errors.</p>'
