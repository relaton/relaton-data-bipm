    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the referenced paper, Ian Mills addresses the confusion caused by the treatment of plane angle in the International System of Units (SI). As he points out, what the SI calls an ‘angle’ is not a dimensional physical quantity but, rather, the dimensionless numerical value of the angle when expressed in radians, thus creating widespread confusion regarding terminology and notation. For example, Mills shows that for the harmonic oscillator, if the conventional argument of the sinusoid represents an angle, it must be divided by a dimensional constant equal to one radian in order to correctly render it dimensionless, thereby greatly clarifying the notation. However, there is a problem with the author’s interpretation of frequency. Although, for uniform rotation, Mills correctly defines the revolution frequency as the <italic>number</italic> of complete revolutions, <italic>N</italic>, divided by the time interval, he takes the unit for <italic>N</italic> to be ‘cycle’ (which he defines as one revolution) rather than the correct unit: the <italic>number</italic> one. The unit for ‘frequency’ then appears to be ‘cycle per second’ (i.e. revolution per second), whereas it should be one per second, correctly called hertz. Thus Mills concludes that ‘frequency’ is the same physical quantity as angular velocity and calls for the ‘hertz’ to be redefined as 2<italic>π</italic> rad s<sup>−1</sup>, a non-coherent derived unit for angular velocity. This misinterpretation of frequency corrupts the remainder of the author’s discussion of the examples considered.</p>
    <p>In my comment, I explain and correct these and related errors.</p>
