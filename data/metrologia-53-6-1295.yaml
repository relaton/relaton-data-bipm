abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper discusses the analysis of inter-laboratory comparison
    (ILC) data where there may be some doubt about the validity of the uncertainty
    statements. We develop a hierarchical model that treats the stated uncertainties
    as estimates of parameters representing the variances associated with the reported
    values of the measurand. The degree of belief in these estimates is modelled by
    an additional set of constants that can also be treated as parameters in the model.
    The hierarchical model is motivated by the analysis of repeated measurements drawn
    from a Gaussian distribution with unknown variance and represents a natural extension
    of the model underlying standard approaches to the analysis of ILC data based
    on a weighted least squares approach. Using Bayesian inference, the model provides
    a natural mechanism for updating the input distributions associated with the values
    reported by the participating laboratories based on the information available
    from all the participants. Importantly, the shapes of the input distributions
    are adjusted, not just their standard deviations. The distribution for the measurand
    is derived in terms of t-distributions and can be calculated using simple numerical
    quadrature schemes. The approach is illustrated on a number of data sets available
    in the literature.</p>
