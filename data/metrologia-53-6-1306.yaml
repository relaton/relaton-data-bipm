abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When a new definition of the kilogram has been adopted in 2018
    as expected, the unit of mass will be realised by the watt balance method, the
    x-ray crystal density method or perhaps other primary methods still to be developed.
    So far, the standard uncertainties associated with the available primary methods
    are at least one order of magnitude larger than the standard uncertainty associated
    with mass comparisons using mass comparators, so differences in primary realisations
    of the kilogram are easily detected, whereas many National Metrology Institutes
    would have to increase their calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) if
    they were traceable to a single primary realisation. This paper presents a scheme
    for obtaining traceability to multiple primary realisations of the kilogram using
    a small group of stainless steel 1 kg weights, which are allowed to change their
    masses over time in a way known to be realistic, and which are calibrated and
    stored in air. An analysis of the scheme shows that if the relative standard uncertainties
    of future primary realisations are equal to the relative standard uncertainties
    of the present methods used to measure the Planck constant, the unit of mass can
    be disseminated with a standard uncertainty less than 0.015 mg, which matches
    the smallest CMCs currently claimed for the calibration of 1 kg weights.</p>
