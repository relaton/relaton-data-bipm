    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>When a new definition of the kilogram has been adopted in 2018 as expected, the unit of mass will be realised by the watt balance method, the x-ray crystal density method or perhaps other primary methods still to be developed. So far, the standard uncertainties associated with the available primary methods are at least one order of magnitude larger than the standard uncertainty associated with mass comparisons using mass comparators, so differences in primary realisations of the kilogram are easily detected, whereas many National Metrology Institutes would have to increase their calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) if they were traceable to a single primary realisation. This paper presents a scheme for obtaining traceability to multiple primary realisations of the kilogram using a small group of stainless steel 1 kg weights, which are allowed to change their masses over time in a way known to be realistic, and which are calibrated and stored in air. An analysis of the scheme shows that if the relative standard uncertainties of future primary realisations are equal to the relative standard uncertainties of the present methods used to measure the Planck constant, the unit of mass can be disseminated with a standard uncertainty less than 0.015 mg, which matches the smallest CMCs currently claimed for the calibration of 1 kg weights.</p>
