abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In the uncertainty assessment of magnetic flux measurements
    in axially symmetric magnets by the translating coil method, the Guide to the
    Uncertainty in Measurement and its supplement cannot be applied: the voltage variation
    at the coil terminals, which is the actual measured quantity, affects the flux
    estimate and its uncertainty. In this paper, a particle filter, implementing a
    sequential Monte-Carlo method based on Bayesian inference, is applied. At this
    aim, the main uncertainty sources are analyzed and a model of the measurement
    process is defined. The results of the experimental validation point out the transport
    system and the acquisition system as the main contributions to the uncertainty
    budget.</p>'
