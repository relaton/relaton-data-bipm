abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The measurement of the lattice-parameter of silicon by x-ray
    interferometry assumes the use of strain-free crystals. This might not be the
    case because surface relaxation, reconstruction, and oxidation cause strains without
    the application of any external force. In a previous work, this intrinsic strain
    was estimated by a finite element analysis, where the surface stress was modeled
    by an elastic membrane having a 1 N m<sup>−1</sup> tensile strength. The present
    paper quantifies the surface stress by a density functional theory calculation.
    We found a value exceeding the nominal value used, which potentially affects the
    measurement accuracy.</p>
