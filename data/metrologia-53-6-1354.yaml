abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the calibration of the relative spectral responsivity
    of the reference radiation thermometer, model LP4, which is used for the experimental
    realisation of the international temperature scale of 1990 above 960 °C at the
    Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science. The relative spectral responsivity
    of LP4 is measured by using a monochromatic source consisting of a super-continuum
    laser and a double-grating monochromator. By monitoring the wavelength of the
    output beam directly with a calibrated wavelength-meter, we achieved a high-accuracy
    measurement of spectral responsivity with a maximum wavelength error of less than
    3 pm, a narrow spectral bandwidth of less than 0.4 nm, and a high dynamic range
    over 8 decades. We evaluated the contributions of various uncertainty components
    of the spectral responsivity measurement to the uncertainty of the temperature
    scale based on a practical estimation approach, which numerically calculates the
    maximal effects of the variations of each component. As a result, we evaluate
    the uncertainty contribution from the spectral responsivity measurement to the
    temperature scale to be less than 64 mK (k  =  1) in a range from 660 °C to 2749
    °C for the LP4 with a filter at 650 nm.</p>
