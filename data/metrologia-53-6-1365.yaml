abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The latest generation of optical atomic clocks is approaching
    the level of one part in 10<sup>18</sup> in terms of frequency stability and uncertainty.
    For clock comparisons and the definition of international time scales, a relativistic
    redshift effect of the clock frequencies has to be taken into account at a corresponding
    uncertainty level of about 0.1 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup> and 0.01 m in terms
    of gravity potential and height, respectively. Besides the predominant static
    part of the gravity potential, temporal variations must be considered in order
    to avoid systematic frequency shifts. Time-variable gravity potential components
    induced by tides and non-tidal mass redistributions are investigated with regard
    to the level of one part in 10<sup>18</sup>. The magnitudes and dominant time
    periods of the individual gravity potential contributions are investigated globally
    and for specific laboratory sites together with the related uncertainty estimates.
    The basics of the computation methods are presented along with the applied models,
    data sets and software. Solid Earth tides contribute by far the most dominant
    signal with a global maximum amplitude of 4.2 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup> for
    the potential and a range (maximum-to-minimum) of up to 1.3 and 10.0 m<sup>2</sup>
    s<sup>−2</sup> in terms of potential differences between specific laboratories
    over continental and intercontinental scales, respectively. Amplitudes of the
    ocean tidal loading potential can amount up to 1.25 m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup>,
    while the range of the potential between specific laboratories is 0.3 and 1.1
    m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−2</sup> over continental and intercontinental scales, respectively.
    These are the only two contributors being relevant at a 10<sup>−17</sup> level.
    However, several other time-variable potential effects can particularly affect
    clock comparisons at the 10<sup>−18</sup> level. Besides solid Earth pole tides,
    these are non-tidal mass redistributions in the atmosphere, the oceans and the
    continental water storage.</p>
