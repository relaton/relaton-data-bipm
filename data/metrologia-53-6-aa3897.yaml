abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Inter-laboratory comparisons use the best available transfer
    standards to check the participants’ uncertainty analyses, identify underestimated
    uncertainty claims or unknown measurement biases, and improve the global measurement
    system. For some measurands, instability of the transfer standard can lead to
    an inconclusive comparison result. If the transfer standard uncertainty is large
    relative to a participating laboratory’s uncertainty, the commonly used standardized
    degree of equivalence  ⩽1 criterion does not always correctly assess whether a
    participant is working within their uncertainty claims. We show comparison results
    that demonstrate this issue and propose several criteria for assessing a comparison
    result as passing, failing, or inconclusive. We investigate the behavior of the
    standardized degree of equivalence and alternative comparison measures for a range
    of values of the transfer standard uncertainty relative to the individual laboratory
    uncertainty values. The proposed alternative criteria successfully discerned between
    passing, failing, and inconclusive comparison results for the cases we examined.</p>
