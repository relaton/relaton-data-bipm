abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In order to perform traceable measurements of the electrical
    parameters of solid-state lighting (SSL) products, it is necessary to technically
    adequately define the measurement procedures and to identify the relevant uncertainty
    sources. The present published written standard for SSL products specifies test
    conditions, but it lacks an explanation of how adequate these test conditions
    are. More specifically, both an identification of uncertainty sources and a quantitative
    uncertainty analysis are absent. This paper fills the related gap in the present
    written standard. New uncertainty sources with respect to conventional lighting
    sources are determined and their effects are quantified. It shows that for power
    measurements, the main uncertainty sources are temperature deviation, power supply
    voltage distortion, and instability of the SSL product. For current RMS measurements,
    the influence of bandwidth, shunt resistor, power supply source impedance and
    ac frequency flatness are significant as well. The measurement uncertainty depends
    not only on the test equipment but is also a function of the characteristics of
    the device under test (DUT), for example, current harmonics spectrum and input
    impedance. Therefore, an online calculation tool is provided to help non-electrical
    experts. Following our procedures, unrealistic uncertainty estimations, unnecessary
    procedures and expensive equipment can be prevented.</p>
