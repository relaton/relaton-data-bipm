abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A calibration-free primary vacuometer based on an ultracold
    atomic gas in a shallow far-off-resonance optical dipole trap is proposed and
    demonstrated. The pressure is obtained by measuring the loss of trapped atoms
    which is caused by collisions with the ambient gas of the vacuum chamber. The
    loss is related to the ambient-gas pressure via a theoretical model based on first
    principles. The model is applicable owing to elimination of a number of systematic
    effects which otherwise preclude or complicate construction of a first-principle
    model. These systematics include loss unrelated to collisions with the ambient
    gas as well as loss dependance on the number and energy of trapped atoms. In the
    demonstrated vacuometer, the atom-number decay is exponential with the rate proportional
    to the pressure, where the proportionality coefficient is expressed via the gas
    composition and van der Waals coefficients  C<sub>6</sub>. Whenever the gas composition
    is unknown, the systematic error is typically well below that of the hot-cathode
    ionization gauge. The vacuometer is implemented using a gas of ultracold lithium-6,
    which is the optimal working body for such a vacuometer. The lowest measured pressure,        2.8  ×     10    −  9          Pa,
    is limited by the vacuum in the apparatus, while the dominant error source of
    4% is due to uncertainty in the  C<sub>6</sub> value and may be improved. Comparison
    with reading of a hot-cathode ionization gauge is also shown.</p>
