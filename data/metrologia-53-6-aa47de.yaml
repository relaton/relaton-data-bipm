abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Fluorescent brightening agents are widely used in various industries
    to enhance the appearance of materials. The angular profiles of emission and reflectance
    of fluorescent surfaces have been shown to deviate from Lambertian behaviour,
    however, in industry and calibration facilities single geometry measurements are
    often used, which requires assumptions to be made on the angular distributions.
    In addition, the angular distribution of reflectance has been shown to deviate
    from that of fluorescence. In this work, it is shown that the angular distribution
    of reflectance is dependent on the excitation wavelength and the effect is explained
    by qualitative and quantitative models. These angular and spectral effects may
    cause measurement errors when single geometry bidirectional measurements are carried
    out. The angular distributions can be taken into account by using goniometrical
    measurements, which however, result in increased calibration time and cost. Alternatively,
    a reference material could be used where the angular dependencies are minimised.
    In this work, a novel material is presented which demonstrates more Lambertian
    emission and reflectance profiles than conventional polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
    based materials and a smaller dependence of angular reflectance on the absorbance
    of the sample.</p>
