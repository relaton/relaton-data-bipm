abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Atomic clocks can be affected by frequency jumps occurring at
    random times and with a random amplitude. The frequency jumps degrade the clock
    stability and this is captured by the Allan variance. In this work we assume that
    the random jumps can be modelled by a compound Poisson process, independent of
    the other stochastic and deterministic processes affecting the clock stability.
    Then, we derive the analytical expression of the Allan variance of a jumping clock.
    We find that the analytical Allan variance does not depend on the actual shape
    of the jumps amplitude distribution, but only on its first and second moments,
    and its final form is the same as for a clock with a random walk of frequency
    and a frequency drift. We conclude that the Allan variance cannot distinguish
    between a compound Poisson process and a Wiener process, hence it may not be sufficient
    to correctly identify the fundamental noise processes affecting a clock. The result
    is general and applicable to any oscillator, whose frequency is affected by a
    jump process with the described statistics.</p>
