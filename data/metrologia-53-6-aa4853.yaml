abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This paper presents a direct comparison between two satellite
    time transfer techniques: common-view (CV) of satellites from the global positioning
    system (GPS) constellation, and time transfer by laser link (T2L2) through the
    low orbiting satellite Jason-2. We describe briefly both techniques, together
    with two independent relative calibration campaigns of the links involving four
    European laboratories. Between the same remote time scale reference points, the
    mean values of the calibrated differences between GPS CV and T2L2 are below 240 ps,
    with standard deviations below 500 ps, mostly due to GPS CV. Almost all sample
    deviations from 0 ns are within the combined uncertainty estimates. Despite the
    relatively small number of common points obtained, due to the fact that T2L2 is
    weather dependent, these results provide an unprecedented sub-ns consistency between
    two independently calibrated microwave and optical satellite time transfer techniques.</p>'
