abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Claims that proximity to the Sun causes variation of decay constants
    at permille level have been investigated for alpha decaying nuclides. Repeated
    decay rate measurements of<sup>209</sup>Po,<sup>226</sup>Ra,<sup>228</sup>Th,<sup>230</sup>U,
    and<sup>241</sup>Am sources were performed over periods of 200 d up to two decades
    at various nuclear metrology institutes around the globe. Residuals from the exponential
    decay curves were inspected for annual oscillations. Systematic deviations from
    a purely exponential decay curve differ in amplitude and phase from one data set
    to another and appear attributable to instabilities in the instrumentation and
    measurement conditions. The most stable activity measurements of α decaying sources
    set an upper limit between 0.0006% and 0.006% to the amplitude of annual oscillations
    in the decay rate. There are no apparent indications for systematic oscillations
    at a level of weeks or months. Oscillations in phase with Earth’s orbital distance
    to the sun could not be observed within 10<sup>−5</sup>–10<sup>−6</sup> range
    precision.</p>
