abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recent thermodynamic temperature measurements at PTB with dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry were performed up to 140 K. Particular care was taken to check
    for possible systematic sources of errors by repeating experiments applying two
    new measuring capacitors and both helium and neon as working gases. The development
    of a new method for determining the effective compressibility of the new capacitors
    as a function of temperature has decreased the uncertainty significantly. The
    combination of the recently obtained results with former values of thermodynamic
    temperature, corrected using new thermodynamic input data, has yielded a consistent
    dataset in the range from 2.5 K to 38 K as well as at 84 K, 120 K, 130 K, and
    140 K. This dataset is in good agreement with the newest results of acoustic gas
    thermometry, which has quite different sources of uncertainty compared with dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry.</p>
