abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Claims that proximity to the Sun causes variations of decay
    constants at the permille level have been investigated for beta-minus decaying
    nuclides. Repeated activity measurements of<sup>3</sup>H,<sup>14</sup>C,<sup>60</sup>Co,<sup>85</sup>Kr,<sup>90</sup>Sr,<sup>124</sup>Sb,<sup>134</sup>Cs,<sup>137</sup>Cs,
    and<sup>154</sup>Eu sources were performed over periods of 259 d up to 5 decades
    at various nuclear metrology institutes. Residuals from the exponential decay
    curves were inspected for annual oscillations. Systematic deviations from a purely
    exponential decay curve differ in amplitude and phase from one data set to another
    and appear attributable to instabilities in the instrumentation and measurement
    conditions. Oscillations in phase with Earth’s orbital distance to the Sun could
    not be observed within 10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−5</sup> range precision. The most
    stable activity measurements of β<sup>−</sup> decaying sources set an upper limit
    of 0.003%–0.007% to the amplitude of annual oscillations in the decay rate. There
    are no apparent indications for systematic oscillations at a level of weeks or
    months.</p>
