abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Some investigations have concluded that the diurnal pattern
    in the time comparison results of present two way satellite time and frequency
    transfer (TWSTFT) links may come mainly from Doppler dependent errors in the time
    of arrival (TOA) measurements made by the receivers of the TWSTFT modems. In this
    paper, several experiments were carried out to test if there is a Doppler dependent
    error in the ‘delay’ measurements of the receivers currently used. By simulating
    quantitative Doppler effects in the time transfer signal both on the carrier and
    the code, a type of Doppler sensitivity on the code was observed in the receivers,
    which has about  −0.49 ns offset in ‘delay’ measurement for a 1  ×  10<sup>−9</sup>
    fractional Doppler shift. This sensitivity is basically the same for modems with
    different serial numbers from the same manufacture. We calculated this Doppler
    caused diurnal pattern in the time comparison results of the transatlantic TWSTFT
    link between NIST and PTB and found that it is very small and negligible, because
    the Doppler dependent error is almost identical in the NIST and PTB measurements
    and therefore it is nearly canceled in the TWSTFT difference.</p>
