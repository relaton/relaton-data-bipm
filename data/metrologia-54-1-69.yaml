abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We present a measurement and analysis scheme for determining
    traceable thermodynamic temperature at cryogenic temperatures using Coulomb blockade
    thermometry. The uncertainty of the electrical measurement is improved by utilizing
    two sampling digital voltmeters instead of the traditional lock-in technique.
    The remaining uncertainty is dominated by that of the numerical analysis of the
    measurement data. Two analysis methods are demonstrated: numerical fitting of
    the full conductance curve and measuring the height of the conductance dip. The
    complete uncertainty analysis shows that using either analysis method the relative
    combined standard uncertainty (k  =  1) in determining the thermodynamic temperature
    in the temperature range from 20 mK to 200 mK is below 0.5%. In this temperature
    range, both analysis methods produced temperature estimates that deviated from
    0.39% to 0.67% from the reference temperatures provided by a superconducting reference
    point device calibrated against the Provisional Low Temperature Scale of 2000.</p>'
