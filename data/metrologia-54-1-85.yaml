abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recently, a scientific comparison of flatness measuring instruments
    at European National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) was performed in the framework
    of EURAMET. The specimen was a well-polished optical surface with a maximum measurement
    aperture of 150 mm in diameter. Here, we present an evaluation concept, which
    allows the determination of a mean flatness map taking into account different
    lateral resolutions of the instruments and different orientations of the specimen
    during measurement. We found that all measurements are in agreement with the mean
    flatness map within the uncertainty intervals stated by the participants. The
    aim of this scientific comparison is to specify an appropriate operation and evaluation
    procedure for future comparisons.</p>
