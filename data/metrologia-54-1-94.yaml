abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, the uncertainty of time transfer based on a bidirectional
    time division multiplexing transmission over a single fiber with the same wavelength
    (BTDM-SFSW) is investigated via theoretical models and experimental measurements.
    According to the principle and system architecture, the uncertainty evaluation
    schemes for BTDM-SFSW based time transfer are presented and the uncertainty sources
    are identified accordingly. In order to avoid the effect of the temperature-dependent
    fiber delay, the measured time intervals at two sites are regarded as a whole
    to obtain an overall uncertainty of time interval measurements. For the uncertainty
    of time transfer modem calibration, aside from the type A uncertainty obtained
    under the applied calibration scheme, the system reproducibility against practical
    operation and the contribution of optical power-dependent receiving delays are
    also included. A mathematical model considering fiber dispersion, polarization
    mode dispersion (PMD) and the Sagnac effect is established to evaluate the uncertainty
    from the fiber link. The characteristics of the uncertainty sources in a long-distance
    fiber-optic time transfer testbed are then explored in detail. The combined expanded
    uncertainties with a coverage factor of 2 are calculated and experimentally validated
    over various non-calibrated fiber extensions.</p>
