abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Ensuring measurement trueness, compliance with regulations
    and conformity with standards are key tasks in metrology which are often considered
    at the time of an inspection. Current practice does not always verify quality
    after or between inspections, calibrations, laboratory comparisons, conformity
    assessments, etc. Statistical models describing behavior over time may ensure
    reliability, i.e. they may give the probability of functioning, compliance or
    survival until some future point in time.</p><p>It may not always be possible
    or economic to inspect a whole population of measuring devices or other units.
    Selecting a subset of the population according to statistical sampling plans and
    inspecting only these, allows conclusions about the quality of the whole population
    with a certain confidence.</p><p>Combining these issues of sampling and aging,
    raises questions such as: How many devices need to be inspected, and at least
    how many of them must conform, so that one can be sure, that more than 100p% of
    the population will comply until the next inspection? This research is to raise
    awareness and offer a simple answer to such time- and sample-based quality statements
    in metrology and beyond.</p><p>Reliability demonstration methods, such as the
    prevailing Weibull binomial model, quantify the confidence in future reliability
    on the basis of a sample. We adapt the binomial model to be applicable to sampling
    without replacement and simplify the Weibull model so that sampling plans may
    be determined on the basis of existing ISO standards. Provided the model is suitable,
    no additional information and no software are needed; and yet, the consumer is
    protected against future failure.</p><p>We establish new sampling plans for utility
    meter surveillance, which are required by a recent modification of German law.
    These sampling plans are given in similar tables to the previous ones, which demonstrates
    their suitability for everyday use.</p>'
