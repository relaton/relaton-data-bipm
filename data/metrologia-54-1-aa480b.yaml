abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We report on characterizations of single-electron pumps at
    the highest accuracy level, enabled by improvements of the small-current measurement
    technique. With these improvements a new accuracy record in measurements on single-electron
    pumps is demonstrated: 0.16 µA · A<sup>−1</sup> of relative combined uncertainty
    was reached within less than 1 d of measurement time. Additionally, robustness
    tests of pump operation on a sub-ppm level revealed a good stability of tunable-barrier
    single-electron pumps against variations in the operating parameters.</p>'
