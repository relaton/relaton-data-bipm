abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we present the outcome of the first international
    comparison in the terahertz frequency range among three different kinds of spectrometers.
    A Fourier-Transform infrared spectrometer, a vector network analyzer and a time-domain
    spectrometer have been employed for measuring the complex refractive index of
    three travelling standards made of selected dielectric materials in order to offer
    a wide enough range of parameters to be measured. The three spectrometers have
    been compared in terms of measurement capability and uncertainty.</p>
