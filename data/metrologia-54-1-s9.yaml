abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Previously (Underwood et al 2015 Meteorol. Appl. 22 830) we
    reported first tests of a device capable of simultaneous, non-contact, temperature
    and humidity (NCTAH) measurements in air. The device used an acoustic thermometer
    and a tuneable diode laser absorption spectrometer (TDLAS), a combination which
    should be capable of an extremely rapid response to changes in humidity as it
    does not require moisture in a solid-state matrix to equilibrate with the surrounding
    air. In this paper we report recent developments of the instrument focussed on
    reducing its response time so that it can be used as a reference instrument for
    assessing the response time of conventional humidity sensors. In addition, the
    interdependence of the temperature and humidity estimates is now accounted for
    in real-time using an iterative procedure, which eliminates the need for data
    post-processing.</p><p>The TDLAS measures water molecule number density based
    on the transmission of an infrared beam (approximate wavelength 1360 nm) through
    a 0.6 m path length. The acoustic thermometer is based around a fixed-path acoustic
    interferometer. The improved NCTAH device now produces estimates of the water
    molecule number density every 20 ms and the temperature output displays an RC
    filter-like response, with a time constant of approximately 30 ms.</p><p>The instrument
    has been tested in a climatic chamber through a temperature range of  −40 °C to  +40
    °C and a dew point range of  −43 °C to  +38 °C, at atmospheric pressure, comparing
    the instrument readings with those from a calibrated hygrometer and four platinum
    resistance thermometers. In steady-state conditions, the instrument readings are
    in good agreement with the conventional sensors, with temperature differences
    less than 1 °C (repeatability 0.1 °C), and humidity differences mostly within
    5% of mixing ratio. Under transient conditions, we demonstrate how the instrument
    can be used to evaluate the response times of conventional sensors.</p>
