    <p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance between the NIMT (Thailand) and the BIPM carried out in 2015. Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the BIM, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13b (for 10 kΩ).</p>
    <p>The results from the NIMT and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95% confidence, k = 2) of 0.20 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 1 Ω and 0.74 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p>
