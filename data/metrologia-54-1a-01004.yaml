    <p></p><p>This intercomparison was fulfilled in conformity with the agreed project of COOMET under ref. No 273-a/RU/03 at ELECTRICITY area. It is bilateral comparison between Ukrmetrteststandard (Ukraine) and VNIIM (Russia) (pilot laboratory). This project was arranged with an aim to establish degree of equivalence between Ukraine and Russia measurement standards and to confirm uncertainties declared by the participants. The results of the comparison will be used for confirmation calibration and measurement capabilities provided by Ukrmetrteststandard (Ukraine). VNIIM (Russia) (pilot laboratory) participated in CCEM-K6.a and has already presented their CMC in this area. The measurements had started in November 2004 and completed in February 2005</p><p>Main text</p><p>
