    <p>An intercomparison of capacitance at 100 pF has taken place within the framework of COOMET. The intercomparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'-UMTS (Ukraine), has involved seven laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization-APMP (NMIJ/AIST, Japan). The results presented in this report appear to show that there are significant differences between some laboratories' representations of the farad. However, the agreement demonstrated by the intercomparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for the capacitance at 100 pF.</p>
