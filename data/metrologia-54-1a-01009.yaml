    <p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison of capacitance at 100 pF between the NSAI-NML (Ireland) and the BIPM carried out in 2016. This comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b in which the BIPM is the pilot laboratory.</p>
    <p>Two 100 pF travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used in this comparison carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements. The standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a similar period at the NSAI-NML, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz, for a measuring rms voltage of 15 V.</p>
    <p>The results from the NSAI-NML and the BIPM were found to be in relatively good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) of 0.85 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>
