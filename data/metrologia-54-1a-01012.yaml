    <p>A key comparison of DC voltage at 1.018 V and 10 V has been conducted from 2009 to 2011 between APMP member laboratories and the BIPM. All participants' results (except one) are within the uncertainty of comparison reference value and also within the uncertainty of the CIPM key comparison reference value of the BIPM.EM-K11.3, approximately 0.08 μV/V for 10 V and 0.2 μV/V for 1.018 V (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>=2). The result of the comparison is supposed to successfully provide participating laboratories with the opportunity to compare national standards within the region, and to support participants' entries in Appendix C of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement.</p>
