    <p>Electromagnetic (EM) probes are widely utilized in the measurement of EM fields for non-ionizing radiation, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing and other applications in the frequency range 5 Hz–60 GHz. They must be calibrated by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) or accredited calibration laboratories in accordance with international standards such as IEEE 1309. The existing NMIs or emerging NMIs should refer to the international comparison measurements in order to assure the quality of their measurement results. Therefore, the electric field comparison measurements organized by TUBITAK UME were performed between TUBITAK UME and SASO NMCC at the 100 Hz, 1 kHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 1 GHz, 10 GHz and 18 GHz frequencies in order to obtain the correction factors of the electric field probes. The comparison measurements were carried out in accordance with the Technical Protocol prepared by TUBITAK UME. The measurements started in October 2017 and were completed in January 2017. There was good agreement found for the correction factors.</p>
