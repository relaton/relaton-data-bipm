    <p></p>
    <p>An on-site comparison of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) resistance standards of the Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was made in April 2017. Measurements of a 100 Ω standard in terms of the conventional value of the von Klitzing constant, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
                   <sub>K-90</sub>, agreed to 6 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with a relative combined standard uncertainty <italic toggle="yes">u</italic>
                   <sub>c</sub> = 25 × 10<sup>−10</sup>. Measurements of 10000 Ω/100 Ω and 100 Ω/1 Ω ratios agreed to 11 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with <italic toggle="yes">u</italic>
                   <sub>c</sub> = 22 × 10<sup>−10</sup> and to 33 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with <italic toggle="yes">u</italic>
                   <sub>c</sub> = 32 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, respectively. The influence of the current reversal time has been systematically investigated in order to take into account possible errors due to the Peltier effect, which may be particularly large in 1 Ω standards.</p>
