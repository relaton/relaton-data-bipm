    <p>Within the framework of the supplementary comparison EURAMET.EM-S31, 'Comparison of capacitance and capacitance ratio', five participants (the BIPM, METAS, LNE, PTB, and VSL) inter-compared their capacitance realisations traced to the quantum Hall resistance measured at either ac or dc. The measurands were the capacitance values of three 10 pF standards and one 100 pF standard, and optionally their voltage and frequency dependences. Because the results were not fully satisfying, the circulation was repeated, augmented by a link to the NMIA calculable capacitor. Also two ac-dc resistors were circulated and their frequency dependences were measured in terms of the ac-dc resistance standards involved in the particular capacitance realisations, to allow inter-comparison of these resistance standards. At the end and in any case, a good agreement is achieved within the expanded uncertainties at coverage factor <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2. Furthermore, the comparison led to new insight regarding the stability and travelling behaviour of the capacitance standards and, by virtue of the link to the NMIA calculable capacitor, to a determination of the von Klitzing constant in agreement with the 2014 CODATA value.</p>
