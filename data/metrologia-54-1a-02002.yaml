    <p>The EUROMET project 823, "Comparison of luminous intensity and luminous flux using lamps as transfer standards" between LNE (formerly BNM), France, and INM-RO, Romania, has linked the INM-RO real-ized candela to the CCPR key comparison reference values. The comparison was registered on BIPM key comparison data base with the numbers EUROMET.PR-K3.a.1.</p>
    <p>The comparison has been piloted by LNE. It has been carried out by successive calibrations of a group of four travelling standard lamps in the two laboratories. The lamps were first calibrated by INM-RO, then cal-ibrated by LNE and calibrated by INM-RO in order to check for any drift or instability. The measurements have been performed over the period November 2004 to June 2006.</p>
    <p>According to the results of the comparison, the Degree of Equivalence of the candela realized by INM-RO to the Key Comparison Reference Value of CCPR-K3 is - 0,72 % with an expended uncertainty (k = 2) of 2.14 %.</p>
