    <p></p><p>A bilateral comparison has been organized between VSL, The Netherlands and BIM, Bulgaria in the field of spectral regular transmittance measurements. This comparison is registered as EURAMET project nr. 1073 and EURAMET.PR-K6.2 in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>The aim of the comparison is to demonstrate the improvement of calibration measurement capabilities of BIM in this working field. If this comparison is successful, i.e. the results support the claimed improvement in uncertainties, the improved CMC's for BIM will be included in Appendix C of the CIPM mutual recognition arrangement (MRA).</p><p>The results of this comparison are linked to key comparison CCPR K6.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
