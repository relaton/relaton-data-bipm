    <p>This report describes an international bilateral key comparison on luminous flux of tungsten lamps between the National Scientific Centre 'Institute of Metrology' (NSC 'IM', Ukraine) and All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI, Russia). The comparison is intended to determine the Degrees of Equivalence (DoE) for NSC 'IM' and the associated expanded uncertainty. VNIIOFI acts as a laboratory, providing the link to the comparison CCPR-K4. The comparison used a set of tungsten incandescent lamps as a transfer standard with a luminous flux of approximately 3800 lm. The determined DoE of NSC 'IM' is -0.94% with an expanded uncertainty (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) of 1.05%.</p>
