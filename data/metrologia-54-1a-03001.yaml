    <p>The National Metrology Laboratory, Malaysia (NML-SIRIM) had coordinated the Supplementary Comparison of Industrial Platinum Resistance Thermometer (IPRT) started from July 2009 until April 2011 together with the National Measurement Institute of Australia (NMIA) and Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). This comparison was opened to all APMP members and 16 participants had taken part in order to consolidate or improve their calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs). Three units of artefacts 100-ohm IPRT belonging to NML-SIRIM, NMIA and KRISS were used and three loops of measurement were run in parallel to shorten the circulation time. The stability of artefacts was monitored with initial and final ice point measurement by each laboratory. The participants need to perform measurement at temperature points (0,-50,-30, 0, 100, 200, 300, 400,0) °C. All submitted data were compiled and adjusted at nominal temperature and by using the linkage from NMIA and KRISS as reference value for all three loops, the temperature deviation from participants from different loops can be compared. The approach of Birge Ratio for final exclusion comprised all the excluded results from the analysis of each loop and the measurement performance for each participant were summarized by the En number value.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
