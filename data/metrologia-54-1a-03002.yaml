abstract:
- content: |-
    <p></p><p>In the temperature range from 0.65 K to 24.5561 K, the ITS-90 is defined by specified vapour-pressure equations for<sup>3</sup>He and<sup>4</sup>He and interpolation equations for a constant-volume gas thermometer using<sup>3</sup>He or<sup>4</sup>He. The definitions are given in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of the ITS-90 text, and methods for realising the scale in this range are outlined in chapters 4 and 5 of the  Guide to the Realization of the ITS-90  (formerly  Supplementary Information for the ITS-90 ). Direct realisations of the ITS-90 by these methods require relatively sophisticated apparatus and time-consuming experiments, and consequently they are rarely carried out. The situation is acceptable in practice only because rhodium-iron resistance thermometers (RIRTs) are available that, once calibrated, are able to maintain their calibrations reliably for long periods of time. They are the practical thermometers on which realisations of the ITS-90 are most accurately maintained, disseminated and compared. The key comparison EURAMET.T-K1 is therefore a comparison of calibrated RIRTs.</p><p></p><p> Main text</p><p>
