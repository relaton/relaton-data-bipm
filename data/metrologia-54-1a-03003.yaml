    <p>A Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) supplementary comparison of platinum resistance thermometer and digital thermometer (AFRIMETS.T-S1) was carried out by the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA), National Institute for Standards Egypt (NIS), National Metrology Institute of Ethiopia (NMIE), Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS), National Institute of Metrology Thailand (NIMT), Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS), Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS), Mauritius Standards Bureau (MSB) and Seychelles Bureau of Standards (SBS) between March 2008 and October 2010. The temperature range of the inter comparison is -50 °C to 450 °C. The results of this comparison are reported here, along with descriptions of the Artefacts and devices used during measurement. This report also presents the uncertainty budget. The results are analysed and normalized error (En) values are reported.</p>
