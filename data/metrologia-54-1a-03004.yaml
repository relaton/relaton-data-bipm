    <p>A Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) supplementary comparison of liquid in glass thermometer (AFRIMETS.T-S5) was carried out by the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA), Zimbabwe Scientific &amp; Industrial Research &amp; Development Centre—National Metrology Institute (SIRDC-NMI), Zambia Bureau of Standards (ZABS), Botswana Bureau of Standards (BOBS), Namibian Standards Institute (NSI), Mauritius Standards Bureau (MSB) and Seychelles Bureau of Standards (SBS) between January and September 2016. The temperature range of the inter comparison is −35 °C to 250 °C. The results of this comparison are reported here, along with descriptions of the Artefacts used. This report also presents the uncertainty budget of each participant. The results are analysed and normalized error (En) values are reported.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
