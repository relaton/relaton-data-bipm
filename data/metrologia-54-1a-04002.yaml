    <p></p><p>In October 2012, the EURAMET Technical Committee for Length, TC-L, decided upon a supplementary comparison on gauge block measurements by mechanical comparison, numbered EURAMET.L-S22, with the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) as the pilot laboratory, assisted by NPL (Andrew Lewis), which would provide a link to CCL-K1. The comparison was registered in February 2013, artefact circulation starts in June 2013 and ended in September 2014. Eight gauge blocks were calibrated using a five point measurement.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
