    <p></p>
    <p>At its meeting in October 2012, the EURAMET Technical Committee for Length, EURAMET TC-L, decided that a key comparison on high precision roundness measurement by multi-step method shall be carried out with CEM acting as the pilot laboratory. The roundness standards to be calibrated were chosen to be a glass hemisphere with a diameter of about 50 mm and a sphere with a diameter of about 30 mm.</p>
    <p>A goal of the key comparisons for topics in dimensional metrology is to demonstrate the equivalence of routine calibration services offered by NMIs to clients, as listed in appendix C of the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA). To this end, participants in this comparison agreed to use the same apparatus and methods as routinely applied to client artefacts. The comparison was registered in March 2013 as Project EURAMET 1269 and at KCDB as supplementary comparison EURAMET.L-S23.2013.</p>
