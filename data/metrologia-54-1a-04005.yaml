    <p>The key comparison EURAMET.L-K8.2009 on roughness was carried out in the framework of a EURAMET project starting in 2009 and ending in 2011. It involved the participation of 14 National Metrology Institutes from Europe, North America, Central America, South America and Africa representing three regional metrology organisations. Four surface texture standards of different type were circulated and on each of the standards several roughness parameters according to the standard ISO 4287 had to be determined. 27 out of 171 individual results were not consistent with the reference value. After some corrective actions the number of inconsistent results could be reduced to 24, which correspond to about 14% of the total. In addition to the material standards, two soft-gauges were circulated, which allow to test the software of the instruments used in the comparison. The comparison results help to support the calibraton and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the laboratories involved in the CIPM MRA.</p>
