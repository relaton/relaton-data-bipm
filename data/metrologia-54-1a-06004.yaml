    <p></p><p>A first key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Laboratory for Nuclear Calibrations (LNK) from the Studiecentrum voor Kernenergie—Centre d'Etude de l'Energie Nucleaire (SCK·CEN), Belgium and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in September 2016. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the SCK·CEN and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0021 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.6 × 10<sup>-3</sup>. The results for an indirect comparison made at the same time are consistent with the direct results at the level of 7 parts in 10<sup>4</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p></p><p> Main text</p><p>
