    <p>A comparison of the dosimetry for accelerator photon beams was carried out between the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) from 23 September to 20 October 2014. The comparison was based on the determination of absorbed dose to water for three radiation qualities of the medical accelerator facilities of the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom). After establishing Draft B, the VSL discovered an error in the calculation of the correction factor for excess-heat linked to the VSL glass vessel used in the measurements at the NPL. The comparison results for the revised standard, reported as ratios of the VSL and the BIPM evaluations (and with the combined standard uncertainties given in parentheses), are 0.9959 (54) at 6 MV, 0.9958 (64) at 10 MV and 0.9991 (75) at 25 MV. This result is part of the on-going BIPM.RI(I)-K6 series of comparisons.</p>
