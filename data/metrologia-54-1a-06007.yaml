    <p></p><p>Six laboratories responsible for the calibration of neutron survey meters were able to participate in the EUROMET #608 comparison (EUROMET.RI(III)-S1). This report establishes the degree of equivalence and uncertainty for each laboratory, for various types of neutron fields 241Am/Be, 252Cf, (252Cf+D2O)/Cd and for the reference quantity, H*(10).</p><p>Main text</p><p>
