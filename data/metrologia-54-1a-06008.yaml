    <p></p><p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NIM, Republic of China and the BIPM in the medium-energy x ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at around the level of the expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the comparison of 6.0 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
