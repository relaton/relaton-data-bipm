    <p></p>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NIM, Republic of China and the BIPM in the medium-energy x ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at around the level of the expanded uncertainty (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) of the comparison of 6.0 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
