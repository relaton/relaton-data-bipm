    <p></p><p>A comparison of the dosimetry for accelerator photon beams was carried out between the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) from 15 to 29 November 2016. The comparison was based on the determination of absorbed dose to water at 10 g cm<sup>−2</sup> for two radiation qualities at the NIM. The results, reported as ratios of the NIM and the BIPM evaluations (and with the combined standard uncertainties given in parentheses), are 0.9917(60) at 6 MV, and 0.9941(59) at 10 MV.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
