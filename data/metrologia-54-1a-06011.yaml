    <p></p><p>In 2016, comparisons of activity measurements of<sup>18</sup>F and<sup>64</sup>Cu using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA). This is the first SIRTI comparison for<sup>64</sup>Cu. Ampoules containing about 27 kBq of<sup>18</sup>F and 100 kBq of<sup>64</sup>Cu solutions were measured in the SIRTI for about 5 and 1.5 half-lives, respectively. The NIST standardized the activity in the ampoules by ionization chamber measurements traceable to 4π(LS)β−γ anticoincidence measurements. The comparisons, identifiers BIPM.RI(II)-K4.F-18 and BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Cu-64, are linked to the corresponding BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18 and BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64 comparisons and degrees of equivalence with the respective key comparison reference values have been evaluated. The NIST replaces its earlier degree of equivalence for<sup>18</sup>F obtained in the frame of the CCRI(II)-K3.F-18 comparison in 2001.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
