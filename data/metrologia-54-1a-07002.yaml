    <p>The report summarizes the Consultative Committee for Mass (CCM) key comparison CCM.P-K4.2012 for absolute pressure spanning the range of 1 Pa to 10 000 Pa. The comparison was carried out at six National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), including National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Czech Metrology Institute (CMI), National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), Centro Nacional de Metrología (CENAM), and DI Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM). The comparison was made via a calibrated transfer standard measured at each of the NMIs facilities using their laboratory standard during the period May 2012 to September 2013. The transfer package constructed for this comparison preformed as designed and provided a stable artifact to compare laboratory standards. Overall the participants were found to be statistically equivalent to the key comparison reference value.</p>
