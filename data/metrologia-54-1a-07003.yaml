    <p></p><p>The comparison CCM.P-K15 is a key comparison in pressure involving six laboratories in three regional metrological organizations (RMO). The measurand of the comparison is the accommodation coefficient of two spinning rotating gauge characterized in nitrogen from 0.1 mPa up to 1.0 Pa. The two transfer standards were circulated from November 2009 until March 2011. The circulation consisted of three loops, one for each RMO, and a new calibration by the pilot be-tween each loop. The stability of one of the transfer standards was poor and was worse than expected based on the previous history of the transfer standard while the other transfer standard demonstrated good stability while circulated in Europe and America and a fair stability while circulated in Asia.</p><p>All the participants demonstrated equivalence to the definition of pressure in their respective primary standards.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
