    <p></p><p>At the CCM WG-LP meeting in Berlin in April 2011 the National Institute of Metrology of the people's republic of China asked for an opportunity to be linked to the CCM.M.P-K15 comparison which just ended. METAS, which had been active as pilot for the CCM.M.P-K15, agreed to make a link with NIM. The NIM introduced a new static expansion system in his laboratory.</p><p>Two spinning rotor gauges and a control electronic are used as transfer standard. The circulation of the transfer standard was made in spring 2012. The drift of the accommodation coefficient of the two SRG was measured by the pilot before and after the comparison. The stability of the transfer standards was excellent and the equivalence between METAS and NIM has been demonstrated.</p><p>A link to the CCM.M.P­K15 has been established using the results from METAS. It has been possible to achieve a link with a small uncertainty due to the strong correlation of the measurements of METAS in the two comparisons.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
