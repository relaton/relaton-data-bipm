    <p>A key comparison, APMP.M.FF-K2. was undertaken by the APMP Technical Committee for Fluid Flow, and was piloted by the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST). The objective of this key comparison is to demonstrate the degree of equivalence of the hydrocarbon flow standards held at the participating laboratories (CMS, NMIA and NMIJ), to link the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of CCM.FF-K2 and to provide supporting evidence for the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) claimed by the participating laboratories in the Asia-Pacific regions. A screw type positive displacement flow meter was selected as a transfer standard. The performance of the transfer standard and its stability was evaluated from repeated measurements by the pilot institute, NMIJ. The transfer standard showed high performance and good stability since the uncertainty due to the transfer standard was less than quoted uncertainties in the participants. CMS and NMIJ have En values which show consistency with both the relevant KCRV for APMP.M.FF-K2.a and each pair of participants. However some En values for NMIA were from 1 to 1.2, indicating 'alert'.</p>
