    <p>Mass calibration is an important activity for National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), due to the amount of measurements on scientific, industrial and legal activities that have traceability to the national mass standards of each country.</p>
    <p>In order to evaluate the stated uncertainty and degree of equivalence between INTI-Argentina and IBMETRO-Bolivia on mass calibration a bilateral comparison was agreed between both laboratories.</p>
