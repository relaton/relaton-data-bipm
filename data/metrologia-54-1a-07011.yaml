- content: |-
    <p></p><p>Evaluation of different types of comparisons to a common set of reference values of a CIPM key comparison is essential to satisfy the concept of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA), where the DoEs of any participant who took part in comparisons should be within the Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) section of the CIPM MRA Key Comparison Data Base. The subject of this supplementary report is therefore to present the equivalence of each National Metrological Institute (NMI) participant in the CCM.D-K4 'Hydrometer' key comparison, which was performed in the density range 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at the temperature of 20 °C, and the linkage of the European and Inter-American NMI results performed in the RMO.M.D-K4 comparisons as well as those of the supplementary SIM.M.D-S2 to the common set of KCRVs of the CCM.D-K4 'Hydrometer'.</p><p>The linking procedure has been obtained by numerical simulation, based on the Monte Carlo method, in which the differences in the results of the different comparison between the intended laboratory and one or more linking laboratory/ies, which took part in both comparisons, are correlated with a continuous function describing the DoEs of the linking laboratory/ies with respect to the common set of KCRVs of the CCM.D-K4.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
