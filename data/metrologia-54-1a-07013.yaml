    <p></p><p>The CCM.FF-K3.2011 comparison was organized for the purpose of determination of the degree of equivalence of the national standards for air speed over the range 0.5 m/s to 40 m/s. An ultrasonic anemometer and a Laser Doppler anemometer were used as transfer standards. Nine laboratories from three RMOs participated between July 2013 and July 2015—EURAMET: PTB, Germany; LNE-CETIAT, France; INRIM, Italy; VSL, The Netherlands; E+E, Austria; SIM: NIST, USA; APMP: NMIJ/AIST, Japan; NIM, China; CMS/ITRI, Chinese Taipei. The measurements were provided at ambient conditions. All results of independent participants were used in the determination of the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and the uncertainty of the KCRV. The reference value was determined at each air speed separately following `procedure A' presented by M G Cox. The degree of equivalence with the KCRV was calculated for each air speed and laboratory. Almost all reported results were consistent with the KCRV.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
