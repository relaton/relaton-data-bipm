    <p></p><p>In the comparisons three Newtonian liquid samples were used with nominal values of 20 mm<sup>2</sup>/s 100 mm<sup>2</sup>/s and 1000 mm<sup>2</sup>/s ('20', '100' and '1000', respectively) at 20 Â°C. Each NMI presented results of measurements values kinematic viscosity samples, uncertainty and uncertainty budget.</p><p>The purpose of these comparisons was confirmation of measurement and calibration capabilities (CMC) of the relevant NMI.</p><p>As a reference the values of kinematic viscosity reference samples were taken as average values of measurement results obtained in the research laboratory of the national standards and research in the field of measurements of viscosity and density of the D I Mendeleev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM, RF), as a participant in international comparisons CCM.V-K1, BIPM.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
