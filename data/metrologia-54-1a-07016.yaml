    <p>During the EURAMET TC-F meeting of 2014 and following the finalization of CCM.FF-K4.2.2011 comparison, it was agreed to start a Regional Key Comparison (KC) on volume measurements using two 100 μL micropipettes (piston pipettes) allowing the participating laboratories to assess the agreement of their results and uncertainties.</p>
    <p>Two 100 μL micropipettes were tested by 15 participants. One participant was not a member or associate member of the BIPM and was be removed from this report. The comparison started in July 2015 and ended in March 2016. The Volume and Flow Laboratory of the Portuguese Institute for Quality (IPQ) was the pilot laboratory and performed the initial and final measurements of the micropipettes. The micropipettes showed a stable volume during the whole comparison, which was confirmed by the results from the pilot laboratory.</p>
    <p>The original results of all participant NMIs were corrected to the standard atmospheric pressure in order to compare results under the same calibration conditions, and the contribution of the 'process-related handling contribution' was added to the uncertainty budget of each participant.</p>
    <p>In general the declared CMCs are in accordance with the KCDB. For the micropipette 354828Z, two laboratories had inconsistent results. For micropipette 354853Z, three laboratories had inconsistent results.</p>
