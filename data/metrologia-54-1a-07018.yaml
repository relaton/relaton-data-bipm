    <p></p><p>This report describes a bilateral comparison of 1 kg stainless steel mass standard between the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), and the National Measurement Centre, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, which is registered in the BIPM KCDB as APMP.M.M-K4.1. This nominal value was chosen as it followed the nominal value of CCM.M-K4. This bilateral comparison was piloted by KRISS. The transfer weight was delivered to A*STAR from KRISS in April 2015 and received back from A*STAR in October 2015. A*STAR are aiming to improve their calibration measurement capability (CMC) for mass of 1 kg. KRISS participated in both this comparison and CCM.M-K4, providing a link between the A*STAR result and the KCRV of CCM.M-K4. The final report of this comparison is given in this document.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
