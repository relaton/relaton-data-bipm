    <p></p><p>For the first time a EURAMET comparison of standard facilities in the field of low air speed is presented. The air velocities range from 0.05 m/s up to 1 m/s. Two different thermal anemometers are used as Transfer Standards (TS), namely a ball-type and a planar-type anemometer. Due to their construction it is possible to analyze different components of the flow vector. Orientation-dependent measurements which are investigated in addition might also deliver information concerning the components of the flow vector. A Comparison Reference Value (CRV) is calculated with the help of the chi-squared test according to the procedure A presented by Cox [1] [2] and the degree of equivalence of the laboratory data to the CRV is determined. Both TS show reasonable results and a high degree of equivalence. Furthermore the degree of equivalence of the laboratory data to each other is investigated in detail.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
