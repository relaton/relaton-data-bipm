    <p></p><p>A supplementary comparison was made between SIM laboratories concerning the calibration of four hydrometers within the range of 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>. The main objectives of the comparison were to evaluate the degree of equivalences SIM NMIs in the calibration of hydrometers of high accuracy. The participant NMIs were: CENAM, IBMETRO, INEN, INDECOPI, INM, INTN and LACOMET.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
