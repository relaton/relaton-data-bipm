abstract:
- content: "<p></p><p>This supplementary comparison was piloted by the Instituto Nacional
    de Calidad (INACAL, Peru) and describes the results of the comparison in mass
    and conventional mass in weights of 2 kg and 10 kg between INACAL-PERU, CENAM-MEXICO
    and CESMEC-CHILE.</p><p>The travelling standards were OIML class E2 weights of
    stainless steel.</p><p>INACAL measured the volume of the traveling standards of
    10 kg and the volume value used for the 2 kg mass standard was provided by the
    PTB.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that
    this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database
    kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for
