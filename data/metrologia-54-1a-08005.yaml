    <p></p><p>As there can be small but measureable differences in isotope ratios between different sources of the same element/compound/material, isotope ratio measurements are applied in a number of different fields including archaeology, environmental science, geochemistry, forensic science and ecology. Isotope ratios for the light elements (H, C, N, O and S) are typically reported as δ-values which are isotope ratios expressed relative to an internationally agreed standard (this standard is the zero-point on the scale), although absolute isotope ratios which are traceable to the SI have also been reported. The IAWG has been granted a traceability exception for the use of arbitrary delta scales until SI traceability can be established at the required level of uncertainty but this goal is some years away.</p><p>While the CCQM IAWG has previously organised several pilot studies on isotope ratio determination (CCQM-P75: Stable isotope delta values in methionine, 2006; CCQM-P105: Sr isotope ratios in wine, 2008; CCQM-K98: Pb isotope ratios in bronze with additional delta values in CCQM-P134, 2011), it has been a number of years since delta values of light elements have been considered and there has been no key comparison (KC). Therefore, the IAWG has included the need for a KC (CCQM-K140) based on an arbitrary delta scale in its program to support ongoing requirements to demonstrate core capabilities as well as specific claims of measurement capability (CMCs) in this area.</p><p>The performance of all five of the CCQM-K140 participants was very good, illustrating their ability to obtain accurate results for carbon isotope ratios, within the calibration range afforded by internationally agreed reference materials (δ13CVPDB-LSVEC between −47.32 % and +535.3 %) with measurement uncertainties of between 0.08 and 0.28 %. This was despite the fact that no two participants used exactly the same approach in terms of instrumentation or data treatment.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
