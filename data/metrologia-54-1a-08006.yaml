    <p>As part of the ongoing key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has been performed between the ozone national standard of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the common reference standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction range of 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol.</p>
