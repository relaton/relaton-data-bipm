    <p>The CCQM-K123 key comparison was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of CCQM to assess and document the capabilities of the national metrology institutes (NMIs) or the designated institutes (DIs) to measure the mass fractions of sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium phosphorous and sulfur in biodiesel fuel (BDF). National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) acted as the coordinating laboratories.</p>
    <p>Results were submitted by 11 NMIs and DIs. Most of the participants used inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), isotope dilution technique with ICP-MS and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) with microwave acid digestion.</p>
    <p>Accounting for relative expanded uncertainty, comparability of measurement results for each of Na, Ca, K, Mg and P was successfully demonstrated by the participants. Concerning S, the variation in results between participants, particularly those using IDMS methods was observed. According to the additional evaluation and investigation, the revised results were overlapping between IDMS measurements at the <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2 level. However, this KC does not support S measurements.</p>
