    <p>Noble gases are one of the key elements used in the various processes of the bulbs industry, automotive industry, space industry, lasers industry, display industry as well as the semiconductor industry. Considering continuous growth, the provision of a reliable standard is required for those industries to improve their productivity.</p>
    <p>In this report, a result of the key comparison, CCQM-K113: noble gas mixture, is presented. Nominal amount-of-substance fractions of argon, neon, krypton, and xenon in helium are 20, 10, 2, and 1 cmol/mol, respectively.</p>
