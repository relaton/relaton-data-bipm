    <p>Under the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM), a key comparison, CCQM-K103, was coordinated by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) and Government Laboratory, Hong Kong, China (GLHK). The comparison was designed to demonstrate NMIs/DIs ability to analyze traces of melamine in milk and milk powder at concentration levels resulting from requirements for food safety. Seven NMIs or DIs participated in the comparison. Final reference value (KCRV) is 0.286 mg/kg, with standard uncertainty of the median as 0.011 mg/kg (3.8 %). The k-factor for the estimation of the expanded uncertainty was chosen as k = 2.57 ( t (0.05;5) ), thus the expanded uncertainty is 0.028 mg/kg (9.8%). The degrees of equivalence with melamine in milk powder KCRV for each participant were reported. The measurement results and degrees of equivalence should be indicative of the performance of a laboratory's measurement capability for IDMS in determining mass fractions in the range from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg of analytes with low molar mass (range 50-300 Da) with high polarity (pK<sub>ow</sub> &gt; -2.0) in milk and milk products. Extension to other analytes and matrices should be applied with care since there is a close linkage to other relevant parameters as e.g. sample preparation procedures (liquid/liquid extraction, SPE clean-up) and analytical separation techniques (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS/MS etc).</p>
