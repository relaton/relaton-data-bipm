    <p>Under the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM), a key comparison, CCQM-K104, was coordinated by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM). The comparison was designed to demonstrate a laboratory's performance in determining the mass fraction of the main component in a complex high purity organic material. Nine NMIs or DIs participated in the comparison. Eight participants reported their results. An additional impurity was resolved from the avermectin B<sub>1</sub>a peak and was tentatively identified as an unknown impurity by NMIA (National Measurement Institute (Australia)). It was subsequently identified by NIM as a diastereoisomer of avermectin B<sub>1</sub>a at the C-26 position. Final reference value (KCRV) = 924.63 mg/g, with uncertainty (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>=1) = 3.89 mg/g, and expanded uncertainty = 8.97 mg/g. The degrees of equivalence with the avermectin B1a KCRV for each participant were reported. The measurement results and degrees of equivalence should be indicative of the performance of a laboratory's measurement capability for the purity assignment of organic compounds of high structural complexity (relative molecular mass range of 500 Da -1000 Da and low polarity (-log K<sub>OW</sub> ⩽ -2).</p>
