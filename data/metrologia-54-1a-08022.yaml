    <p>This key comparison aims to assess the core capabilities of the participants in gas analysis. Such competences include, among others, the capability of preparing Primary Standard gas Mixtures (PSMs), performing the necessary purity analysis on the materials used in the gas mixture preparation, the verification of the composition of newly prepared PSMs against existing ones, and the capability of calibrating the composition of a gas mixture. According to the Strategy for Key Comparisons of the Gas Analysis Working Group, this subsequent key comparison is classified as a track B key comparison, which means that the results of this key comparison can be used to underpin calibration and measurement capabilities for propane under the default scheme.</p>
    <p>The artefact was a binary mixture of propane in nitrogen at a nominal amount-of-substance fraction level of 1000 μmol/mol. The values and uncertainties from the gravimetric gas mixture preparation were used as key comparison reference values (KCRVs). Each transfer standard had its own KCRV. The result of the participating laboratory is consistent with the key comparison reference value within the respective expanded uncertainties and deviates less than 0.1 %.</p>
