    <p>This article presents the report on the COOMET key comparison COOMET.QM-K111, which is linking to the appropriate CCQM comparison—CCQM-K111 'Propane in nitrogen 1000 μmol/mol'. CCQM-K111 was carried out in 2014–2016 and it was one of a series of key comparisons in the gas analysis area assessing core competences.</p>
