abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that occurs primarily in two forms, vitamin D<sub>2</sub> and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is produced naturally when skin is exposed to UV radiation, is naturally-occurring in foods (generally of animal origin), and is fortified in some foods and dietary supplements. Vitamin D<sub>2</sub> occurs in food (generally plant sources) and until recently was the form most often used in dietary supplements. Vitamin D is metabolized in the body to produce several closely related, hydroxylated species (metabolites), with 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> [25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>] and 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>2</sub> [25(OH)D<sub>2</sub>] as the most common metabolites measured in human serum. Concentrations of total vitamin D in human serum, calculated as the sum of 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, are typically in the 16 ng/g to 30 ng/g (40 nmol/L to 75 nmol/L) range, with 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> usually accounting for more than 90 % of the total. An epimer of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, 3-epi-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, can be present at levels up to 10 % of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentration.</p><p>Seven National Metrology Institutions participated in the Track C Key Comparison CCQM-K132 low-polarity analytes in a biological matrix: vitamin D metabolites in human serum. Participants were requested to evaluate the mass fractions, expressed in ng/g, of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub>, and 3-epi-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in two human serum materials, termed Serum Pool I and Serum Pool II. Due to the known low levels of 3-epi-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in both materials and the very low level of 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> in Serum Pool I, the study protocol stated that key comparison reference values (KCRVs) would be assigned only to 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in both materials and 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> in Serum Pool II. Results for 3-epi-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> were requested to evaluate the separation technologies employed; 3-epi-25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> needs to be chromatographically separated from 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> for proper quantification of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>. Results for 25(OH)D<sub>2</sub> in Serum Pool I were requested to explore measurement performance at its low level. All participants used isotope dilution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (ID LC-MS/MS) for the measurement of the vitamin D metabolites.</p><p>Successful participation in CCQM K132 demonstrates capabilities in analysis of low molecular mass (100 g/mol to 500 g/mol) and low-polarity (nonpolar, pKow &lt; â2) analytes at the 1 ng/g to 500 ng/g mass fraction range in complex biological matrixes with core competencies for sample preparation and analysis using ID LC-MS/MS. This study extends the mass fraction capability range to 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> times lower than that demonstrated in previous CCQM Key Comparisons for cholesterol in serum, another nonpolar clinical analyte.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
