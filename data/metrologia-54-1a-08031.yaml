    <p>As part of the on-going key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has been performed between the ozone national standard of the ITRI Center for Measurement Standards (CMS-ITRI) and the common reference standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), via a transfer standard maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction range of 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol.</p>
