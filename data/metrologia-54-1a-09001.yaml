    <p>This is the final report for CIPM key comparison CCAUV.V-K3 in the area of 'vibration' (quantity of acceleration). The aim of this comparison was to measure the voltage sensitivity of one accelerometer standard set with primary means at 27 frequencies from 0.1 Hz to 40 Hz. Fourteen Metrology Institutes from five RMOs have participated in the comparison with National Institute of Metrology, P.R. China as pilot lab and Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais and National Metrology Institute of South Africa as co-pilot labs. One quartz-flexure servo accelerometer of single-ended type and a signal conditioner was circulated among the participants. All but one of the participating laboratories provided their calibration results, which were mostly consistent within their declared expanded uncertainties for magnitude results. Only two participants failed to contribute to the KCRV values calculated for five frequencies. For phase shift, three participants could not contribute to the calculation of the KCRV values in a total of sixteen frequencies. This first low-frequency vibration key comparison revealed the current calibration capabilities of the fourteen participants of five RMOs.</p>
