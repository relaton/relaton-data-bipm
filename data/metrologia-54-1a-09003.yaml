    <p></p><p>The degrees of equivalence of the AFRIMETS.AUV.A-K5 regional key comparison are reported here as the final report. The scope of the comparison covered the complex pressure sensitivities of two LS1P microphones over the frequency range 2 Hz to 10 kHz in accordance with IEC 61094-2: 2009. Four national metrology institutes from two different regional metrology organisations participated in the comparison. Two LS1P microphones were circulated simultaneously to all the participants in a circular configuration. One of the microphones sensitivity shifted and all results associated with this microphone were subsequently excluded from further analysis and linking. The AFRIMETS.AUV.A-K5 comparison results were linked to the CCAUV.A-K5 comparison results via dual participation in the CCAUV.A-K5 and AFRIMETS.AUV.A-K5 comparisons. The degrees of equivalence, linked to the CCAUV.A-K5 comparison, were calculated for all participants of this comparison.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
