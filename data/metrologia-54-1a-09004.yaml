    <p></p><p>A key comparison of vibration acceleration APMP.AUV.V-K2, which is an upgrade from APMP.AUV.V-K1.1, has been made within the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) to include three national laboratories; the CMS-ITRI (Chinese Taipei), the NIMT (Thailand) and the A*Star (Singapore). One pilot laboratory, the NMIJ (Japan), participated to link the RMO APMP results to the CIPM CC key comparison (CCAUV.V-K2), according to the decision of the CCAUV10/D7 during the 10<sup>th</sup> CCAUV meeting. The admissible acceleration amplitude ranges from 10 m/s<sup>2</sup> to 200 m/s<sup>2</sup> over the frequency range from 40 Hz to 5 kHz. The RMO APMP results demonstrate the agreement with the key comparison reference value of CCAUV.V-K2 within the expanded uncertainties considering the armature effect of vibration exciter in a high-frequency range.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
