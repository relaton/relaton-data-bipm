abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper the realization of a two-terminal-pair impedance
    bridge based on pulse-driven Josephson arrays will be presented. This bridge was
    used to link a 10 nF capacitance standard to the quantized Hall resistance at
    1233 Hz. With pulse-driven Josephson arrays the setup for a quadrature bridge
    can be reduced dramatically. For the combination of the AC quantum Hall resistance
    and a 10 nF capacitance standard, most of the uncertainties caused by contact
    resistances in a two-terminal-pair definition were circumvented by a triple-series
    connection of the AC quantum Hall resistance. The capacitance value obtained by
    the new Josephson impedance bridge was compared to the results from a transformer-based
    ratio bridge and agrees within 1.3 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. Sources of systematic
    uncertainties were investigated and the combined relative uncertainty of the bridge
    was determined to be less than 1×10−8 (k  =  1) and 13.9 nF F<sup>−1</sup> (k  =  1)
    for the link of the 10 nF capacitance standard.</p>
