abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The systematic effects of absolute gravimeters have to be investigated
    to fully utilize their capabilities in metrology and geosciences. In Křen et al
    (2016 Metrologia 53 27–40) we found that for an FG5 gravimeter, even a few meter
    long coaxial cable used for transmission of fringe signal causes systematic features
    in residuals and errors at the level of 1–2 µGal. In this paper, we present experimental
    results and appropriate models to explain the effects that were found to be caused
    by impedance mismatches of electronic components and dispersion effects in coaxial
    cables of gravimeters. The experimental results have been obtained for analogue
    and transistor–transistor logic (TTL) compatible signals in the FG5-215 gravimeter
    and for a TTL signal in the FG5X-251 gravimeter. We found that dispersion and
    impedance mismatch effects are similar for both gravimeters. Furthermore, we describe
    a model of the dispersion that allows an evaluation of the effect/correction for
    a given range of the free-fall and thus it is also applicable to other gravimeters.
    The effect of impedance mismatch for the analogue fringe signal is modelled as
    an effect of the reflected electronic signal on the evaluation of zero-crossings.
    The applicability of this model for TTL signal is also discussed.</p>
