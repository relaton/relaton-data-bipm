abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the determination of the Avogadro constant by the x-ray
    crystal density method, an accurate volume measurement of 1 kg Si spheres is of
    primary importance. For this purpose, an optical interferometer was improved and
    used to measure the volumes of two 1 kg silicon spheres which were manufactured
    from a silicon crystal highly enriched in<sup>28</sup>Si. The apparent volumes
    of the spheres, which do not take into account the influence of the surface layers
    on the volume measurement by interferometry, were determined with a relative standard
    uncertainty of as small as 2.0  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>. The surface of the spheres
    was characterized by using an improved spectroscopic ellipsometer. By considering
    the influence of the surface layers, the core volumes of the spheres, which exclude
    the surface layers, were determined. These results were used for the determination
    of the Avogadro constant in 2015 as a framework organized by the International
    Avogadro Coordination project. This paper provides details on the measurements,
    the improvements made to the apparatus, the data analysis and the uncertainty
    evaluation.</p>
