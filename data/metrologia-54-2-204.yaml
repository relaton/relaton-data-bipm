abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the electronic measurement of the Boltzmann constant based
    on Johnson noise thermometry, the ratio of the power spectral densities of thermal
    noise across a resistor at the triple point of water, and pseudo-random noise
    synthetically generated by a quantum-accurate voltage-noise source is constant
    to within 1 part in a billion for frequencies up to 1 GHz. Given knowledge of
    this ratio, and the values of other parameters that are known or measured, one
    can determine the Boltzmann constant. Due, in part, to mismatch between transmission
    lines, the experimental ratio spectrum varies with frequency. We model this spectrum
    as an even polynomial function of frequency where the constant term in the polynomial
    determines the Boltzmann constant. When determining this constant (offset) from
    experimental data, the assumed complexity of the ratio spectrum model and the
    maximum frequency analyzed (fitting bandwidth) dramatically affects results. Here,
    we select the complexity of the model by cross-validationâ€”a data-driven statistical
    learning method. For each of many fitting bandwidths, we determine the component
    of uncertainty of the offset term that accounts for random and systematic effects
    associated with imperfect knowledge of model complexity. We select the fitting
    bandwidth that minimizes this uncertainty. In the most recent measurement of the
    Boltzmann constant, results were determined, in part, by application of an earlier
    version of the method described here. Here, we extend the earlier analysis by
    considering a broader range of fitting bandwidths and quantify an additional component
    of uncertainty that accounts for imperfect performance of our fitting bandwidth
    selection method. For idealized simulated data with additive noise similar to
    experimental data, our method correctly selects the true complexity of the ratio
    spectrum model for all cases considered. A new analysis of data from the recent
    experiment yields evidence for a temporal trend in the offset parameters.</p>
