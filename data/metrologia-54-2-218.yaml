abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a predictable single-photon source (SPS) based on
    a silicon vacancy centre in nanodiamond which is optically excited by a pulsed
    laser. At an excitation rate of 70 MHz the source delivers a photon flux large
    enough to be measured by a low optical flux detector (LOFD). The directly measured
    photon flux constitutes an absolute reference. By changing the repetition rate
    of the pulsed laser, we are able to change the photon flux of our SPS in a controllable
    way which in turn can act as a reference. The advantage of our method is that
    it does not require precise knowledge of the source efficiency, but the source
    is calibrated by the LOFD and can be used for detector responsivity characterizations
    at the few-photon level.</p>
