- content: Abstract<p>Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy
    has received high marks as an excellent measurement tool that does not require
    the same reference standard as the analyte. Measurement parameters have been discussed
    in detail and high-resolution balances have been used for sample preparation.
    However, the high-resolution balances, such as an ultra-microbalance, are not
    general-purpose analytical tools and many analysts may find those balances difficult
    to use, thereby hindering accurate sample preparation for qNMR measurement. In
    this study, we examined the relationship between the resolution of the balance
    and the amount of sample weighed during sample preparation. We were able to confirm
    the accuracy of the assay results for samples weighed on a high-resolution balance,
    such as the ultra-microbalance. Furthermore, when an appropriate tare and amount
    of sample was weighed on a given balance, accurate assay results were obtained
    with another high-resolution balance. Although this is a fundamental result, it
    offers important evidence that would enhance the versatility of the qNMR method.</p>
