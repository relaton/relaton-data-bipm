abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We outline a general framework to compute consensus reference
    values of standard atomic weights, isotope ratios, and isotopic abundances, and
    to evaluate associated uncertainties using modern statistical methods for consensus
    building that can handle mutually inconsistent measurement results. The multivariate
    meta-regression approach presented here is directly relevant to the work of the
    IUPAC Commission on Isotopic Abundances and atomic weights (CIAAW), and we illustrate
    the proposed method in meta-analyses of the isotopic abundances and atomic weights
    of zinc, platinum, antimony, and iridium.</p>
