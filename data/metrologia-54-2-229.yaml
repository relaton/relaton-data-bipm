    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We outline a general framework to compute consensus reference values of standard atomic weights, isotope ratios, and isotopic abundances, and to evaluate associated uncertainties using modern statistical methods for consensus building that can handle mutually inconsistent measurement results. The multivariate meta-regression approach presented here is directly relevant to the work of the IUPAC Commission on Isotopic Abundances and atomic weights (CIAAW), and we illustrate the proposed method in meta-analyses of the isotopic abundances and atomic weights of zinc, platinum, antimony, and iridium.</p>
