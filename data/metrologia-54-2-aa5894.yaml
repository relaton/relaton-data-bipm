abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Three mixtures of argon in oxygen with (1000, 350, 120) μmol
    mol<sup>−1</sup> amount fractions of argon were prepared by the gravimetric method
    for application to thermometry. The mixtures are to be used to study the effects
    of argon impurity in oxygen on the temperature of the triple point of oxygen.
    From an uncertainty assessment compliant with the international standards, the
    relative uncertainty of the amount fraction of argon in the two-step dilution
    method used in this work ranged from 0.040% to 0.072%. The uncertainty was dominated
    by the uncertainties in weighing the mass of argon in the pre-mixture and weighing
    the mass of the pre-mixture in the final mixture. The internal consistency of
    the amount fraction of argon given by the gravimetric method was verified to be
    within 0.025% by measurements via gas chromatography with a thermal conductivity
    detector. The resultant uncertainty in the amount fraction of argon corresponds
    to less than 5 μK in the effect of argon impurity on the triple point of oxygen.
    Therefore, the mixtures have sufficient precision for the thermal study of the
    argon-in-oxygen mixtures.</p>
