abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>As a reference measurement machine for multi-component force
    and moment sensors of up to six components, a hexapod-structured calibration device
    was developed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in 2001. The machine
    can generate and measure forces of up to 10 kN and moments of up to 1 kN · m.
    In this paper, the measurement uncertainty budget of the machine is analyzed,
    beginning with an improved physical model and calculation of sensitivity coefficients
    using the implicit function theorem and the Monte Carlo method. The main influencing
    factors for the measurement uncertainty are discussed and suggestions for further
    reduction of the uncertainty are given.</p>
