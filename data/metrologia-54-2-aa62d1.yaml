abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the evaluation of the second-order Zeeman shift in
    the continuous atomic fountain clock FoCS-2. Because of its continuous operation
    and geometrical constraints, the methods used in pulsed fountains are not applicable.
    We use here time-resolved Zeeman spectroscopy to probe the magnetic field profile
    in the clock. Pulses of ac magnetic excitation allow us to spatially resolve the
    Zeeman frequency and to evaluate the Zeeman shift with a relative uncertainty
    smaller than 5×10−16.</p>
