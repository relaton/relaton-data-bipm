abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The fundamental limits of atomic fountains as operational clocks
    are considered. Four rubidium fountains in operation at the US Naval Observatory
    for over 5.5 years have demonstrated unprecedented long-term stability for continuously
    running clocks (Peil et al 2014 Metrologia 51 263–9, Peil et al 2016 J. Phys.:
    Conf. Ser. 723 012004). With only these rubidium fountains, a post-processed timescale
    can be created that demonstrates superior long-term performance to any individual
    clock by compensating for occasional frequency steps. By comparing to the world’s
    primary standards we demonstrate instability of this rubidium fountain timescale
    reaching the mid 10<sup>−17</sup>’s and zero drift at the level of 1.3  ×  10<sup>−19</sup>
    d<sup>−1</sup>. We discuss fundamental limits due to common mode behaviour or
    individual fountain performance that cannot be corrected.</p>'
