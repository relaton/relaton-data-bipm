abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Small angle generators are simple devices for providing small
    angles traceable to the definition of the SI-unit radian. The most accurate ones
    use a laser interferometer for measurement of angular displacement. Small angle
    generators used for autocollimator calibration usually create angles around a
    single axis. A two-directional angle generator would be preferable, as it could
    more efficiently reveal artefacts related to angular displacement across both
    axes, such as orthogonality of the autocollimator’s measuring axes. Characterizing
    errors depending on one axis only would also be easier, as the setup needs to
    be aligned only once for studying both axes of the autocollimator. We describe
    a novel interferometric two-directional small angle generator which we have built
    and tested for autocollimator calibration. The range is  ±1000″ for both axes.
    The estimated standard uncertainty for full range is 0.0036″ for the horizontal
    and 0.0053″ for the vertical direction.</p>
