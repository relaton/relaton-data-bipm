abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the results of a recent measurement of the absolute
    frequency of the 5s 2S1/2 – 4d 2D5/2 transition of the 88Sr + ion. The optical
    frequency was measured against the international atomic time realization of the
    SI second on the geoid as obtained by frequency transfer using a global positioning
    system link and the precise point positioning technique. The measurement campaign
    yielded more than 100 h of frequency data. It was performed with improvements
    to the stability and accuracy of the single-ion clock compared to the last measurement
    made in 2012. The single ion clock uncertainty is evaluated at 1.5×10−17 when
    contributions from acousto-optic modulator frequency chirps and servo errors are
    taken into account. The stability of the ion clock is 3×10−15 at 1 s averaging,
    a factor of three better than in the previous measurement. The results from the
    two measurement campaigns are in good agreement. The uncertainty of the measurement,
    primarily from the link to the SI second, is 0.75 Hz (1.7×10−15). The frequency
    measured for the S–D clock transition of 88Sr+ is ν0= 444 779 044 095 485.27(75)
    Hz.</p>
