abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We demonstrate the robust operation of a gallium arsenide tunable-barrier
    single-electron pump operating with 1 part-per-million accuracy at a temperature
    of 1.3â€‰K and a pumping frequency of 500 MHz. The accuracy of current quantisation
    is investigated as a function of multiple control parameters, and robust plateaus
    are seen as a function of three control gate voltages and RF drive power. The
    electron capture is found to be in the decay-cascade, rather than the thermally-broadened
    regime. The observation of robust plateaus at an elevated temperature which does
    not require expensive refrigeration is an important step towards validating tunable-barrier
    pumps as practical current standards.</p>
