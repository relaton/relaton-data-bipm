abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For atomic frequency standards in which fluctuations of the
    local oscillator (LO) frequency are the dominant noise source, we examine the
    role of the the servo algorithm that predicts and corrects these frequency fluctuations.
    We derive the optimal linear prediction algorithm, showing how to measure the
    relevant spectral properties of the noise and optimise servo parameters while
    the standard is running, using only the atomic error signal. We find that, for
    realistic LO noise spectra, a conventional integrating servo with a properly chosen
    gain performs nearly as well as the optimal linear predictor. Using simple analytical
    models and numerical simulations, we establish optimum probe times as a function
    of clock atom number and of the dominant noise type in the local oscillator. We
    calculate the resulting LO-dependent scaling of achievable clock stability with
    atom number for product states as well as for maximally-correlated states.</p>
