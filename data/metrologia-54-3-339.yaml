    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This article describes the accurate determination of the molar mass <italic>M</italic> of a sample of argon gas used for the determination of the Boltzmann constant. The method of one of the authors (Moldover <italic>et al</italic> 1988 <italic>J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand</italic>. <bold>93</bold> 85–144) uses the ratio of the square speed of sound in the gas under analysis and in a reference sample of known molar mass. A sample of argon that was isotopically-enriched in <sup>40</sup>Ar was used as the reference, whose unreactive impurities had been independently measured. The results for three gas samples are in good agreement with determinations by gravimetric mass spectrometry; (〈<italic>M</italic><sub>acoustic</sub>/<italic>M</italic><sub>mass-spec</sub>〉  −  1)  =  (−0.31  ±  0.69)  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>, where the indicated uncertainty is one standard deviation that does not account for the uncertainties from the acoustic and mass-spectroscopy references.</p>
