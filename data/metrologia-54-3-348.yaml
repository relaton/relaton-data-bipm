abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the first comparison of distant caesium fountain
    primary frequency standards (PFSs) via an optical fiber link. The 1415 km long
    optical link connects two PFSs at LNE-SYRTE (Laboratoire National de métrologie
    et d’Essais—SYstème de Références Temps-Espace) in Paris (France) with two at
    PTB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) in Braunschweig (Germany). For a long
    time, these PFSs have been major contributors to accuracy of the International
    Atomic Time (TAI), with stated accuracies of around 3×10−16. They have also been
    the references for a number of absolute measurements of clock transition frequencies
    in various optical frequency standards in view of a future redefinition of the
    second. The phase coherent optical frequency transfer via a stabilized telecom
    fiber link enables far better resolution than any other means of frequency transfer
    based on satellite links. The agreement for each pair of distant fountains compared
    is well within the combined uncertainty of a few 10<sup>−16</sup> for all the
    comparisons, which fully supports the stated PFSs’ uncertainties. The comparison
    also includes a rubidium fountain frequency standard participating in the steering
    of TAI and enables a new absolute determination of the<sup>87</sup>Rb ground state
    hyperfine transition frequency with an uncertainty of 3.1×10−16.</p><p>This paper
    is dedicated to the memory of André Clairon, who passed away on 24 December 2015,
    for his pioneering and long-lasting efforts in atomic fountains. He also pioneered
    optical links from as early as 1997.</p>
