abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We demonstrate that the individual single pulse of a nano-second
    laser can be used to measure the spectral responsivity of photovoltaic detectors.
    With this new scheme, the relative spectral responsivity of a photodiode can be
    determined from the spectral reflectance of the surface of a pyroelectric detector.
    We also developed the adequate data acquisition procedure, which can eliminate
    systematic errors caused by the nonlinear pulse response. The method is experimentally
    demonstrated for Si and Ge photodiodes in a wide wavelength range from 420 nm
    to 1600 nm and verified by comparison with the method using a CW source.</p>
