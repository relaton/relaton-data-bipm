abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The fixed points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990
    (ITS-90) are the basis of the calibration of standard platinum resistance thermometers
    (SPRTs). Impurities in the fixed point material at the level of parts per million
    can give rise to an elevation or depression of the fixed point temperature of
    order of millikelvins, which often represents the most significant contribution
    to the uncertainty of SPRT calibrations. A number of methods for correcting for
    the effect of impurities have been advocated, but it is becoming increasingly
    evident that no single method can be used in isolation. In this investigation,
    a suite of five aluminium fixed point cells (defined ITS-90 freezing temperature
    660.323 Â°C) have been constructed, each cell using metal sourced from a different
    supplier. The five cells have very different levels and types of impurities. For
    each cell, chemical assays based on the glow discharge mass spectroscopy (GDMS)
    technique have been obtained from three separate laboratories. In addition a series
    of high quality, long duration freezing curves have been obtained for each cell,
    using three different high quality SPRTs, all measured under nominally identical
    conditions. The set of GDMS analyses and freezing curves were then used to compare
    the different proposed impurity correction methods. It was found that the most
    consistent corrections were obtained with a hybrid correction method based on
    the sum of individual estimates (SIE) and overall maximum estimate (OME), namely
    the SIE/Modified-OME method. Also highly consistent was the correction technique
    based on fitting a Scheil solidification model to the measured freezing curves,
    provided certain well defined constraints are applied. Importantly, the most consistent
    methods are those which do not depend significantly on the chemical assay.</p>
