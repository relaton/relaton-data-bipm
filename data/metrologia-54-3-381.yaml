    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The present study proposes a novel prediction algorithm named ‘random pursuit strategy’. It contains a predictor ensemble consisting of several predictors, each operating in a subspace of the original sample data space. The prediction is calculated by combining the outputs of the individual predictors using a weighted average. The frequency data of cesium clocks and hydrogen masers was predicted using the Kalman filter predictor and random pursuit strategy. The proposed algorithm demonstrates preferable capability in some cases. This could have beneficial applications for system controls in some areas.</p>
