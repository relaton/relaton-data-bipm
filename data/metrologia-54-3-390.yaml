abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The eutectic alloys rhenium–carbon, platinum–carbon and cobalt–carbon
    have been proposed as reference standards for thermometry, with temperature and
    uncertainty values specified within the mise en pratique of the definition of
    the kelvin. These alloys have been investigated in a collaboration of eleven national
    measurement institutes and laboratories. Published results reported the point-of-inflection
    in the melting curve with extremely low uncertainties. However, to be considered
    as standards it is necessary to stipulate what phenomenon a temperature value
    has been ascribed to; specifically, this should be a thermodynamic state. Therefore,
    the data have been further evaluated and the equilibrium liquidus temperatures
    determined based on a consideration of limits and assuming a rectangular probability
    distribution. The values are: for rhenium–carbon 2747.91  ±  0.44 K, for platinum–carbon
    2011.50  ±  0.22 K and for cobalt–carbon 1597.48  ±  0.14 K, with uncertainties
    at approximately a 95% coverage probability. It is proposed that these values
    could be used as the basis of thermodynamic temperature measurement at high temperatures
    (above 1300 K).</p>'
