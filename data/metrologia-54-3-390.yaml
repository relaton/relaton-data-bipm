    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The eutectic alloys rhenium–carbon, platinum–carbon and cobalt–carbon have been proposed as reference standards for thermometry, with temperature and uncertainty values specified within the <italic>mise en pratique</italic> of the definition of the kelvin. These alloys have been investigated in a collaboration of eleven national measurement institutes and laboratories. Published results reported the point-of-inflection in the melting curve with extremely low uncertainties. However, to be considered as standards it is necessary to stipulate what phenomenon a temperature value has been ascribed to; specifically, this should be a thermodynamic state. Therefore, the data have been further evaluated and the equilibrium liquidus temperatures determined based on a consideration of limits and assuming a rectangular probability distribution. The values are: for rhenium–carbon 2747.91  ±  0.44 K, for platinum–carbon 2011.50  ±  0.22 K and for cobalt–carbon 1597.48  ±  0.14 K, with uncertainties at approximately a 95% coverage probability. It is proposed that these values could be used as the basis of thermodynamic temperature measurement at high temperatures (above 1300 K).</p>
