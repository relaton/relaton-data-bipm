    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We present a summary of the Planck constant determinations using the NRC watt balance, now referred to as the NRC Kibble balance. The summary includes a reanalysis of the four determinations performed in late 2013, as well as three new determinations performed in 2016. We also present a number of improvements and modifications to the experiment resulting in lower noise and an improved uncertainty analysis. As well, we present a systematic error that had been previously unrecognized and we have quantified its correction. The seven determinations, using three different nominal masses and two different materials, are reanalysed in a manner consistent with that used by the CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC) and includes a comprehensive assessment of correlations. The result is a Planck constant of 6.626 070 133(60)  ×10<sup>−34</sup> Js and an inferred value of the Avogadro constant of 6.022 140 772(55)  ×10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup>. These fractional uncertainties of less than 10<sup>−8</sup> are the smallest published to date.</p>
