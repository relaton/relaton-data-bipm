    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Half-life values are widely used in nuclear chemistry to model the exponential decay of the activity of radionuclides. The analysis of existing half-life data values reveals a general lack of information on the performed experiments and, in a few cases, an almost complete absence of uncertainty budgets. This is the situation for <sup>31</sup>Si, the radionuclide produced via neutron capture reaction recently used to quantify trace amounts of <sup>30</sup>Si in a sample of the <sup>28</sup>Si-enriched material produced for the determination of the Avogadro constant. In particular, the now recommended 157.36(26) min value is the weighted average of ten data acquired between the 40s and the 90s and published without a detailed discussion of the uncertainty budget. In order to improve the <sup>31</sup>Si half-life value we carried out repeated observations of the <sup>31</sup>Si decay rate via <italic>γ</italic>-ray spectrometry measurements. This paper reports the result we obtained, including details of the experiment and the evaluation of the uncertainty.</p>
