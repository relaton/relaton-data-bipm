abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper summarizes the final results of the electron counting
    capacitance standard experiment at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
    achieved since the publication of a preliminary result in 2012. All systematic
    uncertainty contributions were experimentally quantified and are discussed. Frequency-dependent
    measurements on the 1 pF cryogenic capacitor were performed using a high-precision
    transformer-based capacitance bridge with a relative uncertainty of 0.03 µF F<sup>−1</sup>.
    The results revealed a crucial problem related to the capacitor, which hampered
    realizing the quantum metrology triangle with an accuracy corresponding to a combined
    total uncertainty of better than a few parts per million and eventually caused
    the discontinuation of the experiment at PTB. This paper provides a conclusion
    on the implications for future quantum metrology triangle experiments from the
    latest CODATA adjustment of fundamental constants, and summarizes perspectives
    and outlooks on future quantum metrology triangle experiments based on topical
    developments in small-current metrology.</p>
