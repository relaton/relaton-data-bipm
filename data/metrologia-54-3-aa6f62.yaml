abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The present study proposes a novel prediction algorithm named
    ‘random pursuit strategy’. It contains a predictor ensemble consisting of several
    predictors, each operating in a subspace of the original sample data space. The
    prediction is calculated by combining the outputs of the individual predictors
    using a weighted average. The frequency data of cesium clocks and hydrogen masers
    was predicted using the Kalman filter predictor and random pursuit strategy. The
    proposed algorithm demonstrates preferable capability in some cases. This could
    have beneficial applications for system controls in some areas.</p>
