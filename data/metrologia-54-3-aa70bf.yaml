abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a summary of the Planck constant determinations using
    the NRC watt balance, now referred to as the NRC Kibble balance. The summary includes
    a reanalysis of the four determinations performed in late 2013, as well as three
    new determinations performed in 2016. We also present a number of improvements
    and modifications to the experiment resulting in lower noise and an improved uncertainty
    analysis. As well, we present a systematic error that had been previously unrecognized
    and we have quantified its correction. The seven determinations, using three different
    nominal masses and two different materials, are reanalysed in a manner consistent
    with that used by the CODATA Task Group on Fundamental Constants (TGFC) and includes
    a comprehensive assessment of correlations. The result is a Planck constant of
    6.626 070 133(60)  ×10<sup>−34</sup> Js and an inferred value of the Avogadro
    constant of 6.022 140 772(55)  ×10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>−1</sup>. These fractional
    uncertainties of less than 10<sup>−8</sup> are the smallest published to date.</p>
