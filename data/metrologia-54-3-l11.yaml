abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The complex and multi-parameter nature of chemical composition
    measurement means that establishing traceability is a challenging task. As a result
    incorrect interpretations about the origin of the metrological traceability of
    chemical measurement results can occur. This discussion paper examines why this
    is the case by scrutinising the peculiarities of the gas metrology area. It considers
    in particular: primary methods, dissemination of metrological traceability and
    the role of documentary standards and accreditation bodies in promulgating best
    practice. There is also a discussion of documentary standards relevant to the
    NMI and reference material producer community which need clarification, and the
    impact which key stakeholders in the quality infrastructure can bring to these
    issues.</p>'
