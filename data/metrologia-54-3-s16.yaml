abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Chemical measurement methods are designed to promote accurate
    knowledge of a measurand or system. As such, these methods often allow elicitation
    of latent sources of variability and correlation in experimental data. They typically
    implement measurement equations that support quantification of effects associated
    with calibration standards and other known or observed parametric variables. Additionally,
    multiple samples and calibrants are usually analyzed to assess accuracy of the
    measurement procedure and repeatability by the analyst. Thus, a realistic assessment
    of uncertainty for most chemical measurement methods is not purely bottom-up (based
    on the measurement equation) or top-down (based on the experimental design), but
    inherently contains elements of both. Confidence in results must be rigorously
    evaluated for the sources of variability in all of the bottom-up and top-down
    elements. This type of analysis presents unique challenges due to various statistical
    correlations among the outputs of measurement equations. One approach is to use
    a Bayesian hierarchical (BH) model which is intrinsically rigorous, thus making
    it a straightforward method for use with complex experimental designs, particularly
    when correlations among data are numerous and difficult to elucidate or explicitly
    quantify. In simpler cases, careful analysis using GUM Supplement 1 (MC) methods
    augmented with random effects meta analysis yields similar results to a full BH
    model analysis. In this article we describe both approaches to rigorous uncertainty
    evaluation using as examples measurements of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> in
    solution reference materials via liquid chromatography with UV absorbance detection
    (LC-UV) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometric detection using isotope dilution
    (LC-IDMS).</p>
