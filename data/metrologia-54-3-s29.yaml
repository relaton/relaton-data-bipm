abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We derive a new Bayesian approach for estimating activity when
    partial information about the detection efficiency and the background activity
    is available. Explicit formulas based on the hypergeometric function are given
    for the mean and the variance of the obtained posterior distribution. A Monte
    Carlo method is developed that allows the results of the Bayesian procedure to
    be determined in a simple way. The proposed inference is illustrated by analyzing
    measurements of activity, and the results are compared with those obtained by
    applying a current ISO standard.</p>
