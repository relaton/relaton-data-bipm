abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Interlaboratory studies in measurement science, including key
    comparisons, and meta-analyses in several fields, including medicine, serve to
    intercompare measurement results obtained independently, and typically produce
    a consensus value for the common measurand that blends the values measured by
    the participants.</p><p>Since interlaboratory studies and meta-analyses reveal
    and quantify differences between measured values, regardless of the underlying
    causes for such differences, they also provide so-called ‘top–down’ evaluations
    of measurement uncertainty.</p><p>Measured values are often substantially over-dispersed
    by comparison with their individual, stated uncertainties, thus suggesting the
    existence of yet unrecognized sources of uncertainty (dark uncertainty). We contrast
    two different approaches to take dark uncertainty into account both in the computation
    of consensus values and in the evaluation of the associated uncertainty, which
    have traditionally been preferred by different scientific communities. One inflates
    the stated uncertainties by a multiplicative factor. The other adds laboratory-specific
    ‘effects’ to the value of the measurand.</p><p>After distinguishing what we call
    recipe-based and model-based approaches to data reductions in interlaboratory
    studies, we state six guiding principles that should inform such reductions. These
    principles favor model-based approaches that expose and facilitate the critical
    assessment of validating assumptions, and give preeminence to substantive criteria
    to determine which measurement results to include, and which to exclude, as opposed
    to purely statistical considerations, and also how to weigh them.</p><p>Following
    an overview of maximum likelihood methods, three general purpose procedures for
    data reduction are described in detail, including explanations of how the consensus
    value and degrees of equivalence are computed, and the associated uncertainty
    evaluated: the DerSimonian–Laird procedure; a hierarchical Bayesian procedure;
    and the Linear Pool. These three procedures have been implemented and made widely
    accessible in a Web-based application (NIST Consensus Builder).</p><p>We illustrate
    principles, statistical models, and data reduction procedures in four examples:
    (i) the measurement of the Newtonian constant of gravitation; (ii) the measurement
    of the half-lives of radioactive isotopes of caesium and strontium; (iii) the
    comparison of two alternative treatments for carotid artery stenosis; and (iv)
    a key comparison where the measurand was the calibration factor of a radio-frequency
    power sensor.</p>'
