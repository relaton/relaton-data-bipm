abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Meteorological measurements of air humidity in ground-based
    weather stations worldwide are increasingly being used in studies of climate change.
    However, electronic humidity sensors often suffer gradual drift in sensor readings,
    particularly at the high end of the relative humidity range. This phenomenon is
    well known, but there is currently limited quantitative information available
    about the drift characteristics, and hence about the consequent measurement bias
    or uncertainty that should be attributed to historical humidity data sets.</p><p>In
    order to quantify weather-station hygrometer drift, a dataset has been studied
    from UK weather-station hygrometer records supplied by the UK Met Office calibration
    laboratory. As well as documenting the calibrations and adjustments, the records
    include ‘as-found’ checks of the hygrometers on return from field use. This allows
    average in-service error and drift to be evaluated for the population of instruments.</p><p>The
    approach of the study is presented, together with illustrative initial results
    quantifying mean sensor drift of up to 5%rh. The implications of this for estimating
    bias in observations are discussed, along with discussion of associated uncertainty.
    This includes consideration of the distribution of the data, including the end-limited
    range where readings are capped at 100%rh. The study results justify the Met Office
    practice of adjusting hygrometers to minimise the errors in use. Preliminary conclusions
    and recommendations are made, and further steps are identified for developing
    the methodology.</p>
