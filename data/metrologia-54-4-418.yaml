abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We have investigated, theoretically as well as experimentally,
    the relative merits and demerits of using three different optical configurations
    for a compact coherent population trapping (CPT) vapor clock using<sup>87</sup>Rb.
    These correspond to the following choices of polarizations for the two Raman beams:
    lin ∥ lin, (σ, σ), and push–pull optical pumping (PPOP), applied on the D1 manifold.
    We have used a multi-level atomic model to study the dependence of the CPT spectrum
    on axial as well as transverse magnetic fields for these three schemes. Corresponding
    experimental studies have been performed using a laboratory scale CPT clock employing
    a two cm long, isotopically pure rubidium cell, loaded with a buffer gas. We observed
    a CPT contrast close to 20% with a sub-kilohertz linewidth by adopting the PPOP
    scheme. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each of the three optical excitation
    schemes, and present frequency-stability measurement data for the prototype clock.</p>'
