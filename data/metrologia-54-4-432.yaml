abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A high-frequency vibrometer was used with ultrasonic pulse excitation
    in order to perform a primary hydrophone calibration. This approach enables the
    simultaneous characterization of the amplitude and phase transfer characteristic
    of ultrasonic hydrophones. The method allows a high frequency resolution in a
    considerably short time for the measurement. Furthermore, the uncertainty contributions
    of this approach were investigated and quantified.</p><p>A membrane hydrophone
    was calibrated and the uncertainty budget for this measurement was determined.
    The calibration results are presented up to 70 MHz. The measurement results show
    good agreement with the results obtained by sinusoidal burst excitation through
    the use of the vibrometer and by a homodyne laser interferometer, with RMS deviation
    of approximately 3%–4% in the frequency range from 1 to 60 MHz. Further hydrophones
    were characterized up to 100 MHz with this procedure to demonstrate the suitability
    for very high frequency calibration.</p>
