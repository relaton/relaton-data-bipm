abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the SI and other unit systems, including cgs-em and
    cgs-es, in a framework whereby a system of fully independent and dimensionally
    orthogonal base units is modified by conventions designed to simplify the equations
    that are used within each system. We propose that the radian can be seen as an
    independent unit whose dimensional status is modified in the SI and other unit
    systems for this purpose.</p><p>This framework clarifies how different unit systems
    are interrelated, and identifies the key pieces of information that are needed
    to define both a unit system and the equations that are to be used with it. Specifically,
    these are the size of the base units in the unsimplified system, together with
    sufficient equations to identify all the conventions adopted by the particular
    unit system. The appropriate extra information for the revised SI is presented.
    We do not propose that the treatment of angles as dimensionless within the SI
    is changed.</p><p>It is also proposed that the Gaussian unit system is best seen
    as identical to cgs-es, but with the B and H symbols in equations used to represent
    ‘relativistic’ versions of B and H, which should properly be treated as different
    quantities to the non-relativistic versions. The relativistic versions of B and
    H can similarly be used within the SI, with many of the advantages of the Heaviside–Lorentz
    system.</p>
