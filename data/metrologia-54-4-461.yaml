abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The relative vertical position locking precision between the
    exciting and suspended coils is an important uncertainty for the Planck constant
    traceability in joule balance. In order to improve the relative vertical position
    locking precision, several stability experiments are conducted. The stability
    characteristics of the suspended and exciting coils are measured using a six-axis
    laser interferometer system; meanwhile, the effectiveness of the active vibration
    isolation table is measured using a vibration measurement sensor. The piezoelectric
    ceramic actuators with PID controller are used to compensate the relative vertical
    displacement drifts while a six-axis laser interferometer system is used to measure
    the positions of two coils. Experimental results show that the relative vertical
    position is stably locked.</p>
