abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The redefinition of the kilogram will be based on Planck’s constant,
    which can be calculated from Avogadro’s constant, and hence by ‘counting’ the
    silicon atoms in a monocrystalline<sup>28</sup>Si sphere weighing one kilogram.
    To reduce the influence of the surface layers on the determined value requires,
    amongst other issues, an accurate quantification of these layers on the<sup>28</sup>Si
    spheres. Apart from the native SiO<sub>2</sub> layer, carbonaceous contamination
    layers and adsorbed water molecules are expected to be crucial in determining
    the surface composition. The overall mass contribution of these surface layers
    must be determined with an accuracy below 10% in order to be able to meet the
    targeted uncertainty budget for the redefinition. In this work, we performed a
    quantification of these surface layers, applying reference-free x-ray fluorescence
    spectrometry using a modified manipulator within an ultra-high vacuum chamber.
    Using this setup, we are able to quantitatively assess the surface of the spheres
    on a large area (about 20%) with quantification uncertainties below the required
    target of 10% for oxygen and carbon in order to meet an absolute uncertainty value
    of the mass below 10 µg.</p>
