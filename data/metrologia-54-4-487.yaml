abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the redefinition of the SI-unit kilogram the Avogadro constant
    needs to be determined with lowest possible uncertainty. The approach which is
    followed by an international group including the PTB is the XRCD-method (Azuma
    et al 2015 Metrologia 52 360). Currently the uncertainty of the silicon sphere
    volume determination is the main contribution to the uncertainty of the Avogadro
    constant and therefore critical for reaching the self-set goal of underrunning
    a relative uncertainty of 1.5×10−8. The volume uncertainty itself is dominated
    by the wave-front deformation uncertainty which occurs due to optical imperfections
    in the measurement system. Up to now this type of uncertainty was only roughly
    estimated. This paper presents results from a self developed optical raytracing
    software which allows the main deviations of the real optical system from the
    ideal optical design to be investigated. With this software a complete sphere
    measurement can be simulated which helps to determine the influence of the system
    imperfections. In result the relative uncertainty contribution of the wave-front
    uncertainties to the volume measurement can be reduced to 4.5×10−9.</p>
