abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We introduce a new technique for determining x-ray fluorescence
    line energies and widths, and we present measurements made with this technique
    of 22 x-ray L lines from lanthanide-series elements. The technique uses arrays
    of transition-edge sensors, microcalorimeters with high energy-resolving power
    that simultaneously observe both calibrated x-ray standards and the x-ray emission
    lines under study. The uncertainty in absolute line energies is generally less
    than 0.4 eV in the energy range of 4.5 keV to 7.5 keV. Of the seventeen line energies
    of neodymium, samarium, and holmium, thirteen are found to be consistent with
    the available x-ray reference data measured after 1990; only two of the four lines
    for which reference data predate 1980, however, are consistent with our results.
    Five lines of terbium are measured with uncertainties that improve on those of
    existing data by factors of two or more. These results eliminate a significant
    discrepancy between measured and calculated x-ray line energies for the terbium
    L l line (5.551 keV). The line widths are also measured, with uncertainties of
    0.6 eV or less on the full-width at half-maximum in most cases. These measurements
    were made with an array of approximately one hundred superconducting x-ray microcalorimeters,
    each sensitive to an energy band from 1 keV to 8 keV. No energy-dispersive spectrometer
    has previously been used for absolute-energy estimation at this level of accuracy.
    Future spectrometers, with superior linearity and energy resolution, will allow
    us to improve on these results and expand the measurements to more elements and
    a wider range of line energies.</p>
