abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Spectral irradiance data are often used to calculate colorimetric
    properties, such as color coordinates and color temperatures of light sources
    by integration. The spectral data may contain unknown correlations that should
    be accounted for in the uncertainty estimation. We propose a new method for estimating
    uncertainties in such cases. The method goes through all possible scenarios of
    deviations using Monte Carlo analysis. Varying spectral error functions are produced
    by combining spectral base functions, and the distorted spectra are used to calculate
    the colorimetric quantities. Standard deviations of the colorimetric quantities
    at different scenarios give uncertainties assuming no correlations, uncertainties
    assuming full correlation, and uncertainties for an unfavorable case of unknown
    correlations, which turn out to be a significant source of uncertainty. With 1%
    standard uncertainty in spectral irradiance, the expanded uncertainty of the correlated
    color temperature of a source corresponding to the CIE Standard Illuminant A may
    reach as high as 37.2 K in unfavorable conditions, when calculations assuming
    full correlation give zero uncertainty, and calculations assuming no correlations
    yield the expanded uncertainties of 5.6 K and 12.1 K, with wavelength steps of
    1 nm and 5 nm used in spectral integrations, respectively. We also show that there
    is an absolute limit of 60.2 K in the error of the correlated color temperature
    for Standard Illuminant A when assuming 1% standard uncertainty in the spectral
    irradiance. A comparison of our uncorrelated uncertainties with those obtained
    using analytical methods by other research groups shows good agreement. We re-estimated
    the uncertainties for the colorimetric properties of our 1 kW photometric standard
    lamps using the new method. The revised uncertainty of color temperature is a
    factor of 2.5 higher than the uncertainty assuming no correlations.</p>
