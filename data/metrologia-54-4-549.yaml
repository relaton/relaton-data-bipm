    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Recent measurements using acoustic gas thermometry have determined the value of the Boltzmann constant, <italic>k</italic>, with a relative uncertainty less than 1  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>. These results have been supported by a measurement with a relative uncertainty of 1.9  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> made with dielectric-constant gas thermometry. Together, the measurements meet the requirements of the International Committee for Weights and Measures and enable them to proceed with the redefinition of the kelvin in 2018. In further support, we provide a new determination of <italic>k</italic> using a purely electronic approach, Johnson noise thermometry, in which the thermal noise power generated by a sensing resistor immersed in a triple-point-of-water cell is compared to the noise power of a quantum-accurate pseudo-random noise waveform of nominally equal noise power. The experimental setup differs from that of the 2015 determination in several respects: a 100 Ω resistor is used as the thermal noise source, identical thin coaxial cables made of solid beryllium–copper conductors and foam dielectrics are used to connect the thermal and quantum-accurate noise sources to the correlator so as to minimize the temperature and frequency sensitivity of the impedances in the connecting leads, and no trimming capacitors or inductors are inserted into the connecting leads. The combination of reduced uncertainty due to spectral mismatches in the connecting leads and reduced statistical uncertainty due to a longer integration period of 100 d results in an improved determination of <italic>k</italic>  =  1.380 649 7(37)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup> with a relative standard uncertainty of 2.7  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> and a relative offset of 0.89  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> from the CODATA 2014 recommended value. The most significant terms in the uncertainty budget, the statistical uncertainty and the spectral-mismatch uncertainty, are uncorrelated with the corresponding uncertainties in the 2015 measurements.</p>
