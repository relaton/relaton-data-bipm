abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Recent measurements using acoustic gas thermometry have determined
    the value of the Boltzmann constant, k, with a relative uncertainty less than
    1  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>. These results have been supported by a measurement with
    a relative uncertainty of 1.9  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> made with dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry. Together, the measurements meet the requirements of the International
    Committee for Weights and Measures and enable them to proceed with the redefinition
    of the kelvin in 2018. In further support, we provide a new determination of k
    using a purely electronic approach, Johnson noise thermometry, in which the thermal
    noise power generated by a sensing resistor immersed in a triple-point-of-water
    cell is compared to the noise power of a quantum-accurate pseudo-random noise
    waveform of nominally equal noise power. The experimental setup differs from that
    of the 2015 determination in several respects: a 100 Ω resistor is used as the
    thermal noise source, identical thin coaxial cables made of solid beryllium–copper
    conductors and foam dielectrics are used to connect the thermal and quantum-accurate
    noise sources to the correlator so as to minimize the temperature and frequency
    sensitivity of the impedances in the connecting leads, and no trimming capacitors
    or inductors are inserted into the connecting leads. The combination of reduced
    uncertainty due to spectral mismatches in the connecting leads and reduced statistical
    uncertainty due to a longer integration period of 100 d results in an improved
    determination of k  =  1.380 649 7(37)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup> with
    a relative standard uncertainty of 2.7  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> and a relative offset
    of 0.89  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> from the CODATA 2014 recommended value. The most significant
    terms in the uncertainty budget, the statistical uncertainty and the spectral-mismatch
    uncertainty, are uncorrelated with the corresponding uncertainties in the 2015
    measurements.</p>'
