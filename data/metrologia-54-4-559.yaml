abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Dimensional measurements by laser interferometry require a correction
    because of diffraction, which makes the fringe period different from the wavelength
    of a plane wave. The fractional correction—from parts in 10<sup>−7</sup> to parts
    in 10<sup>−9</sup>, depending on the beam collimation—is half the central second
    moment of the angular power-spectrum of the beam, a generalization of the divergence
    concept. We report new insights into the second moment measurement and their consequences
    on the measurement of the silicon lattice parameter by combined x-ray and optical
    interferometry.</p>
