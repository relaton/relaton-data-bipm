abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Relative humidity (RH) is a quantity widely used in various
    fields such as metrology, meteorology, climatology or engineering. However, RH
    is neither uniformly defined, nor do some definitions properly account for deviations
    from ideal-gas properties, nor is the application range of interest fully covered.
    In this paper, a new full-range definition of RH is proposed that is based on
    the thermodynamics of activities in order to include deviations from ideal-gas
    behaviour. Below the critical point of pure water, at pressures p  &lt;  22.064 MPa
    and temperatures T  &lt;  647.096 K, RH is rigorously defined as the relative
    activity (or relative fugacity) of water in humid air. For this purpose, reference
    states of the relative activity are specified appropriately. Asymptotically, the
    ideal-gas limit of the new definition is consistent with de-facto standard RH
    definitions published previously and recommended internationally. Virial approximations
    are reported for estimating small corrections to the ideal-gas equations.</p>
