    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper presents a fisheye camera method for determining spatial non-uniformity corrections in luminous flux measurements with integrating spheres. Using a fisheye camera installed into a port of an integrating sphere, the relative angular intensity distribution of the lamp under test is determined. This angular distribution is used for calculating the spatial non-uniformity correction for the lamp when combined with the spatial responsivity data of the sphere. The method was validated by comparing it to a traditional goniophotometric approach when determining spatial correction factors for 13 LED lamps with different angular spreads. The deviations between the spatial correction factors obtained using the two methods ranged from <inline-formula><tex-math><?CDATA $-0.15$ ></tex-math><mml:math overflow="scroll"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mo>âˆ’</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.15</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="metaa7cb7ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>% to 0.15%. The mean magnitude of the deviations was 0.06%. For a typical LED lamp, the expanded uncertainty (<inline-formula><tex-math><?CDATA $k = 2$ ></tex-math><mml:math overflow="scroll"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="metaa7cb7ieqn002.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>) for the spatial non-uniformity correction factor was evaluated to be 0.28%. The fisheye camera method removes the need for goniophotometric measurements in determining spatial non-uniformity corrections, thus resulting in considerable system simplification. Generally, no permanent modifications to existing integrating spheres are required.</p>
