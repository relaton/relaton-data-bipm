abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents an approach for updating the epistemic uncertainty
    of ultrasonic flow meter measurements under non-ideal flow conditions. Instead
    of re-calibrating the instrument to correct its behavior in these difficult working
    conditions, a Bayesian calibration of a computer model of the real process is
    used. The numerical model is based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and a
    surrogate model is constructed from a limited number of CFD calculations using
    kriging. The computer model predicts the flow rate dependent on certain parameters
    including the bulk Reynolds numberâ€”which carries information about the true speed
    of the flow, and is measured only approximately by an ultrasonic flow meter. Bayesian
    calibration is applied, and the posterior of the true speed can be derived from
    the marginal posterior of the Reynolds number. This pdf has a smaller uncertainty
    with respect to the observed data used to fit the model on the condition that
    sufficiently informative data are available. If this is the case, the proposed
    approach is capable of reducing not only the uncertainty but also the error associated
    with the flow meter measurements in non-ideal conditions.</p>
