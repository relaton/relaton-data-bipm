abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A metrological challenge is currently underway to replace the
    present definition of the kilogram. One prerequisite for this is that the Avogadro
    constant, N<sub>A</sub>, which defines the number of atoms in a mole, needs to
    be determined with a relative uncertainty of better than 2  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>.
    The method applied in this case is based on the x-ray crystal density experiment
    using silicon crystals. The first attempt, in which silicon of natural isotopic
    composition was used, failed. The solution chosen subsequently was the usage of
    silicon highly enriched in<sup>28</sup>Si from Russia. First, this paper reviews
    previous efforts from the very first beginnings to an international collaboration
    with the goal of producing a<sup>28</sup>Si single crystal with a mass of 5 kg,
    an enrichment greater than 0.9999 and of sufficient chemical purity. Then the
    paper describes the activities of a follow-up project, conducted by PTB, to produce
    a new generation of highly enriched silicon in order to demonstrate the quasi-industrial
    and reliable production of more than 12 kg of the<sup>28</sup>Si material with
    enrichments of five nines. The intention of this project is also to show the availability
    of<sup>28</sup>Si single crystals as a guarantee for the future realisation of
    the redefined kilogram.</p>
