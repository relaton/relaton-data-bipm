abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The authors of a recent paper (Billas et al 2016 Metrologia
    53 1259–71) describe the development of a primary standard for the absorbed dose
    in an aqueous solution containing the radionuclide<sup>90</sup>Y. By positioning
    a thin-window extrapolation chamber near the surface of the solution they determine
    the absorbed dose in the air cavity. Using Monte Carlo calculations and knowledge
    of the<sup>90</sup>Y β-ray spectrum they relate the absorbed dose in air to that
    in the aqueous solution. I point out that there is no need to develop a new standard
    for this problem because knowledge of the activity of the radionuclide, combined
    with its decay characteristics, is adequate to establish a primary standard for
    the absorbed dose in water. Furthermore, the uncertainty using this approach is
    significantly smaller than that achieved using the authors’ technique. Results
    from Monte Carlo calculations are reported that: (1) determine the minimum phantom
    size required to establish charged particle equilibrium; (2) show that the authors
    have neglected bremsstrahlung losses from the phantom; (3) show why the authors’
    results are very sensitive to the air gap between the solution and the window
    of the ionization chamber. Finally, I consider the problem of calibrating secondary
    detectors against the primary standard.</p>'
