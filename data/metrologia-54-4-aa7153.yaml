abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the scope of the redetermination of Avogadro’s constant N<sub>A</sub>,
    a new isotopically enriched silicon crystal has been produced, from which two
    spheres were manufactured. After the crystal properties, the lattice parameter
    and molar mass, as well as the masses of the two spheres have been determined,
    the volume of the spheres was also measured. For this, the sphere interferometer
    of PTB was used. The methods of the interferometric measurements have been improved
    and the major contributions to the uncertainty have been investigated thoroughly.
    As a result, the total uncertainty could be reduced significantly, yielding a
    substantial impact on the determination of Avogadro’s constant. The mean diameter
    of each sphere was measured twice with a repeatability of  ±2  ×  10<sup>−10</sup>,
    and the relative uncertainty of the ‘apparent’ volume, which disregards the comparatively
    small influence of the optical effects of surface layers, was reduced to 7  ×  10<sup>−9</sup>.
    The final results of the volumes and comments on their uncertainties are given.</p>
