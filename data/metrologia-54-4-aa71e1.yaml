abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The self-attraction effect needs to be evaluated and corrected
    towards a 10<sup>−9</sup> level absolute determination of the local gravitational
    acceleration g in Kibble balance experiments. In this paper, the self-attraction
    effect of the BIPM Kibble balance apparatus is modelled by linking the gravitational
    field to the electrical field based on an electrostatic finite element analysis.
    A mapping of the gravitational field with different construction segments of the
    apparatus is presented, yielding a total correction of (4.7±0.5) μGal at the mean
    trajectory position. Experimental measurements are carried out to check the self-attraction
    model. Based on the obtained result and previous measurements, we updated the
    g determination along the measurement trajectory for the forthcoming Planck constant
    measurement.</p>
