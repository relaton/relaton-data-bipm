abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present precision measurements of the fractional quantized
    Hall effect, where the quantized resistance R[1/3] in the fractional quantum Hall
    state at filling factor 1/3 was compared with a quantized resistance R[2], represented
    by an integer quantum Hall state at filling factor 2. A cryogenic current comparator
    bridge capable of currents down to the nanoampere range was used to directly compare
    two resistance values of two GaAs-based devices located in two cryostats. A value
    of 1–(5.3  ±  6.3) 10<sup>−8</sup> (95% confidence level) was obtained for the
    ratio (R[1/3]/6R[2]). This constitutes the most precise comparison of integer
    resistance quantization (in terms of h/e<sup>2</sup>) in single-particle systems
    and of fractional quantization in fractionally charged quasi-particle systems.
    While not relevant for practical metrology, such a test of the validity of the
    underlying physics is of significance in the context of the upcoming revision
    of the SI.</p>
