abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a fisheye camera method for determining
    spatial non-uniformity corrections in luminous flux measurements with integrating
    spheres. Using a fisheye camera installed into a port of an integrating sphere,
    the relative angular intensity distribution of the lamp under test is determined.
    This angular distribution is used for calculating the spatial non-uniformity correction
    for the lamp when combined with the spatial responsivity data of the sphere. The
    method was validated by comparing it to a traditional goniophotometric approach
    when determining spatial correction factors for 13 LED lamps with different angular
    spreads. The deviations between the spatial correction factors obtained using
    the two methods ranged from âˆ’0.15% to 0.15%. The mean magnitude of the deviations
    was 0.06%. For a typical LED lamp, the expanded uncertainty (k=2) for the spatial
    non-uniformity correction factor was evaluated to be 0.28%. The fisheye camera
    method removes the need for goniophotometric measurements in determining spatial
    non-uniformity corrections, thus resulting in considerable system simplification.
    Generally, no permanent modifications to existing integrating spheres are required.</p>
