abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Calibrated optical choppers are used in high-power laser calibration
    services at the National Institute of Standards and Technology for beam power
    reduction due to their advantages in performance and safety over wedges and semi-transparent
    materials. While the design, operation, and calibration of such choppers is generally
    straightforward, fabrication tolerances and edge geometry must be taken into account
    for low transmission (&lt;5%) choppers now required to accommodate the increased
    powers (upwards of 10 kW) available for the calibration service. The slit edge
    is presented to the beam at non-zero angles of incidence and for edge thicknesses
    on order of 10% of the slit width, the relative error from design transmission
    can exceed 2% (depending on beam diameter and angle of incidence). Both slit edge
    presentation at non-zero angles of incidence and displacement of the slit edges
    due to minor variation in fabrication or coating yield significant changes in
    transmission with radial displacement of the beam over the chopper face. While
    diffraction effects play a smaller role under typical setup conditions, they become
    an appreciable factor for detectors having small entrance apertures or located
    far from the chopper wheel. Here we demonstrate a close agreement between the
    calculated and measured transmission ratio for two optical choppers when considering
    these three effects.</p>
