abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>One of the most promising approaches for evaluating CT image
    quality is task-specific quality assessment. This involves a simplified version
    of a clinical task, e.g. deciding whether an image belongs to the class of images
    that contain the signature of a lesion or not. Task-specific quality assessment
    can be done by model observers, which are mathematical procedures that carry out
    the classification task. The most widely used figure of merit for CT image quality
    is the area under the ROC curve (AUC), a quantity which characterizes the performance
    of a given model observer. In order to estimate AUC from a finite sample of images,
    different approaches from classical statistics have been suggested. The goal of
    this paper is to introduce task-specific quality assessment of CT images to metrology
    and to propose a novel Bayesian estimation of AUC for the channelized Hotelling
    observer (CHO) applied to the task of detecting a lesion at a known image location.
    It is assumed that signal-present and signal-absent images follow multivariate
    normal distributions with the same covariance matrix. The Bayesian approach results
    in a posterior distribution for the AUC of the CHO which provides in addition
    a complete characterization of the uncertainty of this figure of merit. The approach
    is illustrated by its application to both simulated and experimental data.</p>
