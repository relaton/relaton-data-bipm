abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In general, the dynamic sensitivity of a force transducer depends
    upon the mechanical system in which it is used. This dependence serves as motivation
    to develop a dynamic force transfer standard, which can be used to calibrate an
    application transducer in situ. In this work, we SI-traceably calibrate a hand-held
    force transducer, namely an impact hammer, by using a mass suspended from a thin
    line which is cut to produce a known dynamic force in the form of a step function.
    We show that this instrument is a promising candidate as a transfer standard,
    since its dynamic response has small variance between different users. This calibrated
    transfer standard is then used to calibrate a secondary force transducer in an
    example application setting. The combined standard uncertainty (k  =  2) in the
    calibration of the transfer standard was determined to be 2.1% or less, up to
    a bandwidth of 5 kHz. The combined standard uncertainty (k  =  2) in the performed
    transfer calibration was less than 4%, up to 3 kHz. An advantage of the transfer
    calibration framework presented here, is that the transfer standard can be used
    to transfer SI-traceable calibrations without the use of any SI-traceable voltage
    metrology instrumentation.</p>
