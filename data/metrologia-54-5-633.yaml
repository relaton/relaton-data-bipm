abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST) have measured the value of the Planck constant to be h=6.626069934(89)×10−34J s
    (relative standard uncertainty 13×10−9). The result is based on over 10 000 weighings
    of masses with nominal values ranging from 0.5 kg to 2 kg with the Kibble balance
    NIST-4. The uncertainty has been reduced by more than twofold relative to a previous
    determination because of three factors: (1) a much larger data set than previously
    available, allowing a more realistic, and smaller, Type A evaluation; (2) a more
    comprehensive measurement of the back action of the weighing current on the magnet
    by weighing masses up to 2 kg, decreasing the uncertainty associated with magnet
    non-linearity; (3) a rigorous investigation of the dependence of the geometric
    factor on the coil velocity reducing the uncertainty assigned to time-dependent
    leakage of current in the coil.</p>'
