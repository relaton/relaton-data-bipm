abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A criticism levelled at the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty
    in Measurement (GUM) is that it is based on a mixture of frequentist and Bayesian
    thinking. In particular, the GUM’s Type A (statistical) uncertainty evaluations
    are frequentist, whereas the Type B evaluations, using state-of-knowledge distributions,
    are Bayesian. In contrast, making the GUM fully Bayesian implies, among other
    things, that a conventional objective Bayesian approach to Type A uncertainty
    evaluation for a number n of observations leads to the impractical consequence
    that n must be at least equal to 4, thus presenting a difficulty for many metrologists.
    This paper presents a Bayesian analysis of Type A uncertainty evaluation that
    applies for all n⩾2, as in the frequentist analysis in the current GUM. The analysis
    is based on assuming that the observations are drawn from a normal distribution
    (as in the conventional objective Bayesian analysis), but uses an informative
    prior based on lower and upper bounds for the standard deviation of the sampling
    distribution for the quantity under consideration. The main outcome of the analysis
    is a closed-form mathematical expression for the factor by which the standard
    deviation of the mean observation should be multiplied to calculate the required
    standard uncertainty. Metrological examples are used to illustrate the approach,
    which is straightforward to apply using a formula or look-up table.</p>
