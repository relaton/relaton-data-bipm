abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the quantitative surface characterization of a monocrystalline
    silicon sphere, PTB has constructed and put into operation an analytical instrument,
    which combines x-ray fluorescence and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques.
    The main objective of this novel instrument is the characterization of the oxide
    layer and unintentional contaminations, e.g. from hydrocarbons. It is equipped
    with a ball manipulator allowing measurements at each point on the surface of
    ball-shaped samples with a diameter of about 93.7 mm. Monocrystalline silicon
    spheres with this diameter allow a realization of the SI base unit of mass.</p>
