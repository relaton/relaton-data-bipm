abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A new determination of the molar gas constant was performed
    from measurements of the speed of sound in argon at the triple point of water
    and extrapolation to zero pressure. A new resonant cavity was used. This is a
    triaxial ellipsoid whose walls are gold-coated steel and which is divided into
    two identical halves that are bolted and sealed with an O-ring. Microwave and
    electroacoustic traducers are located in the northern and southern parts of the
    cavity, respectively, so that measurements of microwave and acoustic frequencies
    are carried out in the same experiment. Measurements were taken at pressures from
    600 kPa to 60 kPa and at 273.16 K. The internal equivalent radius of the cavity
    was accurately determined by microwave measurements and the first four radial
    symmetric acoustic modes were simultaneously measured and used to calculate the
    speed of sound. The improvements made using the new cavity have reduced by half
    the main contributions to the uncertainty due to the radius determination using
    microwave measurements which amounts to 4.7 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> and the acoustic
    measurements, 4.4 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>, where the main contribution (3.7 parts
    in 10<sup>6</sup>) is the relative excess half-widths associated with the limit
    of our acoustic model, compared with our previous measurements. As a result of
    all the improvements with the new cavity and the measurements performed, we determined
    the molar gas constant R  =  (8.314 449  ±  0.000 056) J · K<sup>−1</sup> · mol<sup>−1</sup>
    which corresponds to a relative standard uncertainty of 6.7 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>.
    The value reported in this paper lies  −1.3 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> below the
    recommended value of CODATA 2014, although still within the range consistent with
    it.</p>
