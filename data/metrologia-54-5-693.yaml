abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A new single crystal from isotopically enriched silicon was
    used to determine the Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub> by the x-ray-crystal density
    method. The new crystal, named Si28-23Pr11, has a higher enrichment than the former
    ‘AVO28’ crystal allowing a smaller uncertainty of the molar mass determination.
    Again, two 1 kg spheres were manufactured from this crystal. The crystal and the
    spheres were measured with improved and new methods. One sphere, Si28kg01a, was
    measured at NMIJ and PTB with very consistent results. The other sphere, Si28kg01b,
    was measured only at PTB and yielded nearly the same Avogadro constant value.
    The mean result for both 1 kg spheres is N<sub>A</sub>  =  6.022 140 526(70)  ×  10<sup>23</sup>
    mol<sup>−1</sup> with a relative standard uncertainty of 1.2  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>.
    This value deviates from the Avogadro value published in 2015 for the AVO28 crystal
    by about 3.9(2.1)  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>. Possible reasons for this difference are
    discussed and additional measurements are proposed.</p>
