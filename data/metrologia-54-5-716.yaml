abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To determine the Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub> by the x-ray
    crystal density method, the density of a<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal was determined
    by absolute measurements of the mass and volume of a 1 kg sphere manufactured
    from the crystal. The mass and volume were determined by an optical interferometer
    and a vacuum mass comparator, respectively. The sphere surface was characterized
    by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry to derive the
    mass and volume of the Si core of the sphere excluding the surface layers. From
    the mass and volume, the density of the Si core was determined with a relative
    standard uncertainty of 2.3  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>. By combining the Si core density
    with the lattice constant and the molar mass of the sphere reported by the International
    Avogadro Coordination (IAC) project in 2015, a new value of 6.022 140 84(15)  ×  10<sup>23</sup>
    mol<sup>−1</sup> was obtained for N<sub>A</sub> with a relative standard uncertainty
    of 2.4  ×  10<sup>−8</sup>. To make the N<sub>A</sub> value determined in this
    work usable for a future adjustment of the fundamental constants by the CODATA
    Task Group on Fundamental Constants, the correlation of the new N<sub>A</sub>
    value with the N<sub>A</sub> values determined in our previous works was examined.
    The correlation coefficients with the values of N<sub>A</sub> determined by IAC
    in 2011 and 2015 were estimated to be 0.07 and 0.28, respectively. The correlation
    of the new N<sub>A</sub> value with the N<sub>A</sub> value determined by IAC
    in 2017 using a different<sup>28</sup>Si-enriched crystal was also examined, and
    the correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.21.</p>
