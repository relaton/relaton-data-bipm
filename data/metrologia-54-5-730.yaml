abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>A value for the Boltzmann constant was measured electronically
    using an improved version of the Johnson Noise Thermometry (JNT) system at the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA. This system is different
    from prior ones, including those from the 2011 determination at NIST and both
    2015 and 2017 determinations at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China.
    As in all three previous determinations, the main contribution to the combined
    uncertainty is the statistical uncertainty in the noise measurement, which is
    mitigated by accumulating and integrating many weeks of cross-correlated measured
    data. The second major uncertainty contribution also still results from variations
    in the frequency response of the ratio of the measured spectral noise of the two
    noise sources, the sense resistor at the triple-point of water and the superconducting
    quantum voltage noise source. In this paper, we briefly describe the major differences
    between our JNT system and previous systems, in particular the input circuit and
    approach we used to match the frequency responses of the two noise sources. After
    analyzing and integrating 50 d of accumulated data, we determined a value: k =1.380 642 9(69)×10−23
    J K<sup>−1</sup> with a relative standard uncertainty of 5.0×10−6 and relative
    offset −4.05×10−6 from the CODATA 2014 recommended value.</p>'
