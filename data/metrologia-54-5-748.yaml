abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report a new determination of the Boltzmann constant k<sub>B</sub>
    using a cylindrical acoustic gas thermometer. We determined the length of the
    copper cavity from measurements of its microwave resonance frequencies. This contrasts
    with our previous work (Zhang et al 2011 Int. J. Thermophys. 32 1297, Lin et al
    2013 Metrologia 50 417, Feng et al 2015 Metrologia 52 S343) that determined the
    length of a different cavity using two-color optical interferometry. In this new
    study, the half-widths of the acoustic resonances are closer to their theoretical
    values than in our previous work. Despite significant changes in resonator design
    and the way in which the cylinder length is determined, the value of k<sub>B</sub>
    is substantially unchanged. We combined this result with our four previous results
    to calculate a global weighted mean of our k<sub>B</sub> determinations. The calculation
    follows CODATA’s method (Mohr and Taylor 2000 Rev. Mod. Phys. 72 351) for obtaining
    the weighted mean value of k<sub>B</sub> that accounts for the correlations among
    the measured quantities in this work and in our four previous determinations of
    k<sub>B</sub>. The weighted mean k^B is 1.380 6484(28)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J
    K<sup>−1</sup> with the relative standard uncertainty of 2.0  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>.
    The corresponding value of the universal gas constant is 8.314 459(17) J K<sup>−1</sup>
    mol<sup>−1</sup> with the relative standard uncertainty of 2.0  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
