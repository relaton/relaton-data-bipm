abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The National Institute of Metrology (NIM, China) proposed a
    joule balance method to measure the Planck constant in 2006, and built the first
    prototype NIM-1 to verify its principle with a relative uncertainty of 8.9  ×  10<sup>–6</sup>
    by 2013. Since 2013, a new joule balance NIM-2 has been designed, with a series
    of improvements to reduce the measurement uncertainty. By April 2017, NIM-2 has
    been constructed and can be employed to measure the Planck constant in vacuum.
    A first measurement on NIM-2 yields a determination of the Planck constant is
    6.626 069 2(16)  ×  10<sup>–34</sup> Js with a relative uncertainty of 2.4  ×  10<sup>–7</sup>.
    The determination differs in relative terms by  −1.27  ×  10<sup>–7</sup> from
    the CODATA 2014 value. Further improvement of NIM-2 is still in progress towards
    10<sup>–8</sup> level uncertainty in the future.</p>
