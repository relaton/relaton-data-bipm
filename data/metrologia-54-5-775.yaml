abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The magnet is one of the fundamental elements in Kibble balances.
    The Kibble balance group at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM)
    proposed a permanent magnet with a radial field, which has been widely employed
    in other Kibble balance experiments. In this paper, we discuss a different method
    of operation for the BIPM-type magnet, i.e. only the lower half of the magnetic
    circuit is closed. The merit of such a magnet is its convenience for opening the
    air gap and adjusting the coil. A disadvantage is that it can yield a lower and
    sloped magnetic field profile with less shielding. In the approach described,
    high permeability yokes are used to flatten the magnetic profile, which has proven
    to be a novel and convenient approach for removing the nonuniformity of the magnetic
    profile due to magnet magnetization asymmetries. The performance of the half-closed
    BIPM magnet is evaluated using experimental measurements. The results show that
    the half-closed magnetic circuit retains most of the main features of the fully-closed
    magnet and is a good option for the early stages of Kibble balance operations.
    In addition, the profile change due to the coil current is predicted and experimentally
    verified with a bifilar coil. Related systematic effects are discussed for the
    Planck constant measurement.</p>
