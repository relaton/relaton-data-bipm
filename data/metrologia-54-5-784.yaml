abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper explores in a metrological perspective the basic
    characteristics of an (i) experimental process that (ii) provides publicly trustworthy
    information (iii) on the property of an object as a value of that property (iv)
    through the comparison of the property and a reference set of properties of the
    same kind, at the same time not requiring that the property is quantitative. The
    conclusion is that such a process, called here a nominal property evaluation,
    is not only both logically and operatively possible, but actually shares most
    of the fundamental features of measurement, and in particular the possibility
    to provide publicly trustworthy information. Hence the proposed conceptual framework
    paves the way toward a harmonized treatment of nominal properties in metrology.</p>
