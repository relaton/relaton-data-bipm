abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The compact lightweight absolute radiometer (CLARA) experiment
    aims at measuring the total solar irradiance (TSI) in space and is scheduled to
    fly on the Norwegian NORSAT-1 micro satellite. The CLARA experiment will contribute
    to the long term monitoring of the TSI variability to support the analysis of
    potential long term trends in the Sun’s variability. CLARA is traceable to the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology radiometric scale and will provide
    further evidence for the TSI value on an absolute scale. In this paper we present
    the design, characterization, and calibration details of the CLARA instrument.
    The combined measurement uncertainty for the calibrated SI-traceable CLARA flight
    instrument is 567–912 ppm (k  =  1) depending on the measuring channel.</p>
