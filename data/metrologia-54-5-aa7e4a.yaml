abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The evaluations of measurement uncertainty involving the application
    of statistical methods to measurement data (Type A evaluations as specified in
    the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, GUM) comprise the following
    three main steps: (i) developing a statistical model that captures the pattern
    of dispersion or variability in the experimental data, and that relates the data
    either to the measurand directly or to some intermediate quantity (input quantity)
    that the measurand depends on; (ii) selecting a procedure for data reduction that
    is consistent with this model and that is fit for the purpose that the results
    are intended to serve; (iii) producing estimates of the model parameters, or predictions
    based on the fitted model, and evaluations of uncertainty that qualify either
    those estimates or these predictions, and that are suitable for use in subsequent
    uncertainty propagation exercises.</p><p>We illustrate these steps in uncertainty
    evaluations related to the measurement of the mass fraction of vanadium in a bituminous
    coal reference material, including the assessment of the homogeneity of the material,
    and to the calibration and measurement of the amount-of-substance fraction of
    a hydrochlorofluorocarbon in air, and of the age of a meteorite.</p><p>Our goal
    is to expose the plurality of choices that can reasonably be made when taking
    each of the three steps outlined above, and to show that different choices typically
    lead to different estimates of the quantities of interest, and to different evaluations
    of the associated uncertainty. In all the examples, the several alternatives considered
    represent choices that comparably competent statisticians might make, but who
    differ in the assumptions that they are prepared to rely on, and in their selection
    of approach to statistical inference. They represent also alternative treatments
    that the same statistician might give to the same data when the results are intended
    for different purposes.</p>'
