abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The concept of the relative sensitivity factors required for
    the correction of the measured ion beam ratios in pin-cell glow discharge mass
    spectrometry is examined in detail. We propose a data-driven model for predicting
    the relative response factors, which relies on a non-linear least squares adjustment
    and analyte/matrix interchangeability phenomena. The model provides a self-consistent
    set of response factors for any analyte/matrix combination of any element that
    appears as either an analyte or matrix in at least one known response factor.</p>
