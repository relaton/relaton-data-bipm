abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Metrology dedicated to electricity and magnetism has changed
    considerably in recent years. It encompasses almost all modern scientific, industrial,
    and societal challenges, e.g. the revision of the International System of Units,
    the profound transformation of industry, changes in energy use and generation,
    health, and environment, as well as nanotechnologies (including graphene and 2D
    materials) and quantum engineering. Over the same period, driven by the globalization
    of worldwide trade, the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (referred to as the CIPM
    MRA) was set up. As a result, the regional metrology organizations (RMOs) of national
    metrology institutes have grown in significance. EURAMET is the European RMO and
    has been very prominent in developing a strategic research agenda (SRA) and has
    established a comprehensive research programme. This paper reviews the highlights
    of EURAMET in electrical metrology within the European Metrology Research Programme
    and its main contributions to the CIPM MRA. In 2012 EURAMET undertook an extensive
    roadmapping exercise for proposed activities for the next decade which will also
    be discussed in this paper. This work has resulted in a new SRA of the second
    largest European funding programme: European Metrology Programme for Innovation
    and Research.</p>'
