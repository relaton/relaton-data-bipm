    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Two-way frequency transfer on optical fibers is a powerful technique for the comparison of distant clocks over long and ultra-long hauls. In contrast to traditional Doppler noise cancellation, it is capable of sustaining higher link attenuation, mitigating the need of optical amplification and regeneration and thus reducing the setup complexity. We investigate the ultimate limitations of the two-way approach on a 300 km multiplexed fiber haul, considering fully independent setups and acquisition systems at the two link ends. We derive a theoretical model to predict the performance deterioration due to a bad synchronisation of the measurements, which is confirmed by experimental results. This study demonstrates that two-way optical frequency transfer is a reliable and performing technique, capable of sustaining remote clocks comparisons at the <inline-formula><tex-math><?CDATA $10^{-19}$ ></tex-math><mml:math overflow="scroll"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>âˆ’</mml:mo><mml:mn>19</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mstyle></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="metaa8a41ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> resolution, and is relevant for the development of a fiber network of continental scale for frequency metrology in Europe.</p>
