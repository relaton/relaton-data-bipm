abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two-way frequency transfer on optical fibers is a powerful technique
    for the comparison of distant clocks over long and ultra-long hauls. In contrast
    to traditional Doppler noise cancellation, it is capable of sustaining higher
    link attenuation, mitigating the need of optical amplification and regeneration
    and thus reducing the setup complexity. We investigate the ultimate limitations
    of the two-way approach on a 300 km multiplexed fiber haul, considering fully
    independent setups and acquisition systems at the two link ends. We derive a theoretical
    model to predict the performance deterioration due to a bad synchronisation of
    the measurements, which is confirmed by experimental results. This study demonstrates
    that two-way optical frequency transfer is a reliable and performing technique,
    capable of sustaining remote clocks comparisons at the 10âˆ’19 resolution, and is
    relevant for the development of a fiber network of continental scale for frequency
    metrology in Europe.</p>
