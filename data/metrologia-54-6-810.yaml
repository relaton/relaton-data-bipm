abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present an optimization algorithm to obtain low-uncertainty
    dynamic pressure measurements from a force-transducer-based device. In this paper,
    the advantages and disadvantages of the methods that are commonly used to measure
    the propellant powder gas pressure, the applicable scope of dynamic pressure calibration
    devices, and the shortcomings of the traditional comparison calibration method
    based on the drop-weight device are firstly analysed in detail. Then, a dynamic
    calibration method for measuring pressure using a force sensor based on a drop-weight
    device is introduced. This method can effectively save time when many pressure
    sensors are calibrated simultaneously and extend the life of expensive reference
    sensors. However, the force sensor is installed between the drop-weight and the
    hammerhead by transition pieces through the connection mode of bolt fastening,
    which causes adverse effects such as additional pretightening and inertia forces.
    To solve these effects, the influence mechanisms of the pretightening force, the
    inertia force and other influence factors on the force measurement are theoretically
    analysed. Then a measurement correction method for the force measurement is proposed
    based on an artificial neural network optimized by a genetic algorithm. The training
    and testing data sets are obtained from calibration tests, and the selection criteria
    for the key parameters of the correction model is discussed. The evaluation results
    for the test data show that the correction model can effectively improve the force
    measurement accuracy of the force sensor. Compared with the traditional high-accuracy
    comparison calibration method, the percentage difference of the impact-force-based
    measurement is less than 0.6% and the relative uncertainty of the corrected force
    value is 1.95%, which can meet the requirements of engineering applications.</p>
