abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) consists of
    two custom-made induced junction photodiodes that are mounted in a wedged trap
    configuration for the reduction of reflectance losses. Until now, all manufactured
    PQED photodiodes have been based on a structure where a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer
    is thermally grown on top of p-type silicon substrate. In this paper, we present
    the design, manufacturing, modelling and characterization of a new type of PQED,
    where the photodiodes have an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer on top of n-type
    silicon substrate. Atomic layer deposition is used to deposit the layer to the
    desired thickness. Two sets of photodiodes with varying oxide thicknesses and
    substrate doping concentrations were fabricated. In order to predict recombination
    losses of charge carriers, a 3D model of the photodiode was built into Cogenda
    Genius semiconductor simulation software. It is important to note that a novel
    experimental method was developed to obtain values for the 3D model parameters.
    This makes the prediction of the PQED responsivity a completely autonomous process.
    Detectors were characterized for temperature dependence of dark current, spatial
    uniformity of responsivity, reflectance, linearity and absolute responsivity at
    the wavelengths of 488 nm and 532 nm. For both sets of photodiodes, the modelled
    and measured responsivities were generally in agreement within the measurement
    and modelling uncertainties of around 100 parts per million (ppm). There is, however,
    an indication that the modelled internal quantum deficiency may be underestimated
    by a similar amount. Moreover, the responsivities of the detectors were spatially
    uniform within 30 ppm peak-to-peak variation. The results obtained in this research
    indicate that the n-type induced junction photodiode is a very promising alternative
    to the existing p-type detectors, and thus give additional credibility to the
    concept of modelled quantum detector serving as a primary standard. Furthermore,
    the manufacturing of PQEDs is no longer dependent on the availability of a certain
    type of very lightly doped p-type silicon wafers.</p>
