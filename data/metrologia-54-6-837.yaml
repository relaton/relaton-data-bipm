abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A suite of capacitors of fixed values for use with the new calculable
    cross capacitor and measurement system at the National Measurement Institute Australia
    has been constructed. One set of capacitors, of values 5, 10, 20 and 50 pF, is
    of Invar construction; a second set, of values 50, 100, 200 and 500 pF, is comprised
    of fused silica elements. In the case of the Invar capacitors, an analytical calculation
    of capacitance has been derived that facilitates the design process.</p>
