    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A suite of capacitors of fixed values for use with the new calculable cross capacitor and measurement system at the National Measurement Institute Australia has been constructed. One set of capacitors, of values 5, 10, 20 and 50 pF, is of Invar construction; a second set, of values 50, 100, 200 and 500 pF, is comprised of fused silica elements. In the case of the Invar capacitors, an analytical calculation of capacitance has been derived that facilitates the design process.</p>
