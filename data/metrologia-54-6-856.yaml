abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The SI unit of temperature will soon be redefined in terms of
    a fixed value of the Boltzmann constant k derived from an ensemble of measurements
    worldwide. We report on a new determination of k using acoustic thermometry of
    helium-4 gas in a 3 l volume quasi-spherical resonator. The method is based on
    the accurate determination of acoustic and microwave resonances to measure the
    speed of sound at different pressures. We find for the universal gas constant
    R  =  8.314 4614(50) J·mol<sup>−1</sup>·K<sup>−1</sup>. Using the current best
    available value of the Avogadro constant, we obtain k  =  1.380 648 78(83)  ×  10<sup>−23</sup>
    J·K<sup>−1</sup> with u(k)/k  =  0.60  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>, where the uncertainty
    u is one standard uncertainty corresponding to a 68% confidence level. This value
    is consistent with our previous determinations and with that of the 2014 CODATA
    adjustment of the fundamental constants (Mohr et al 2016 Rev. Mod. Phys. 88 035009),
    within the standard uncertainties. We combined the present values of k and u(k)
    with earlier values that were measured at LNE. Assuming the maximum possible correlations
    between the measurements, (k<sub>present</sub>/〈k〉  −  1)  =  0.07  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>
    and the combined u<sub>r</sub>(k) is reduced to 0.56  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>. Assuming
    minimum correlations, (k<sub>present</sub>/〈k〉  −  1)  =  0.10  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>
    and the combined u<sub>r</sub>(k) is reduced to 0.48  ×  10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
