    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This work is motivated by examples of collaborative studies where some within-study uncertainty estimates are missing, and promotes Bayes estimators of the common mean of heterogeneous normal observations with possibly absent variance estimates. The Bayesian procedures against a non-informative reference prior and their empirical versions are obtained under several scenarios for the available variance estimates. Their long run performance in terms of the mean squared error, the coverage probability and the width of the corresponding intervals is discussed.</p>
