abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This work is motivated by examples of collaborative studies
    where some within-study uncertainty estimates are missing, and promotes Bayes
    estimators of the common mean of heterogeneous normal observations with possibly
    absent variance estimates. The Bayesian procedures against a non-informative reference
    prior and their empirical versions are obtained under several scenarios for the
    available variance estimates. Their long run performance in terms of the mean
    squared error, the coverage probability and the width of the corresponding intervals
    is discussed.</p>
