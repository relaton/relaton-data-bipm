abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on our measurement of the Boltzmann constant by Johnson
    noise thermometry (JNT) using an integrated quantum voltage noise source (IQVNS)
    that is fully implemented with superconducting integrated circuit technology.
    The IQVNS generates calculable pseudo white noise voltages to calibrate the JNT
    system. The thermal noise of a sensing resistor placed at the temperature of the
    triple point of water was measured precisely by the IQVNS-based JNT. We accumulated
    data of more than 429 200 s in total (over 6 d) and used the Akaike information
    criterion to estimate the fitting frequency range for the quadratic model to calculate
    the Boltzmann constant. Upon detailed evaluation of the uncertainty components,
    the experimentally obtained Boltzmann constant was k=1.3806436×10−23 J K<sup>−1</sup>
    with a relative combined uncertainty of 10.22×10−6. The value of k is relatively
    −3.56×10−6 lower than the CODATA 2014 value (Mohr et al 2016 Rev. Mod. Phys. 88
    035009).</p>
