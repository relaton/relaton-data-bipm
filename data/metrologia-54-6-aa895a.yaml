abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To meet the needs of industries using high pressure technologies,
    in traceable, reliable and accurate pressure measurements, a joint research project
    of the five national metrology institutes and the university was carried out within
    the European Metrology Research Programme. In particular, finite element methods
    were established for stress–strain analysis of elastic and nonlinear elastic–plastic
    deformation, as well as of contact processes in pressure-measuring piston-cylinder
    assemblies, and high-pressure components at pressures above 1 GPa. New pressure
    measuring multipliers were developed and characterised, which allow realisation
    of the pressure scale up to 1.6 GPa. This characterisation is based on research
    including measurements of material elastic constants by the resonant ultrasound
    spectroscopy, hardness of materials of high pressure components, density and viscosity
    of pressure transmitting liquids at pressures up to 1.4 GPa and dimensional measurements
    on piston-cylinders. A 1.6 GPa pressure system was created for operation of the
    1.6 GPa multipliers and calibration of high pressure transducers. A transfer standard
    for 1.5 GPa pressure range, based on pressure transducers, was built and tested.
    Herewith, the project developed the capability of measuring pressures up to 1.6 GPa,
    from which industrial users can calibrate their pressure measurement devices for
    accurate measurements up to 1.5 GPa.</p>
