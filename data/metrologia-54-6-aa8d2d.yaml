abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The new definition of the kilogram, which is expected to be
    adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2018, will bring
    some major changes to mass metrology. The most fundamental change will be the
    replacement of the present artefact-based definition with a universal definition,
    enabling in principle any National Metrology Institute (NMI) to realize the kilogram.
    The principles for the realization and dissemination of the kilogram in the revised
    SI are described in the  mise en pratique  of the definition of the kilogram.
    This paper provides some additional information and explains how traceability
    can be obtained by NMIs that do not operate a primary experiment to realize the
    definition of the kilogram.</p>
