abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Primary standard gas mixtures (PSMs) are typically prepared
    in cylinders and the amount-of-substance fractions are determined by purity analysis
    and gravimetric method. However, the actual amount-of-substance fraction can be
    different from the gravimetrically determined value due to adsorption loss onto
    the internal surface of cylinders. The resulted difference due to the adsorption
    loss can be larger than the PSM uncertainty. In this study, the cylinder-to-cylinder
    division method is proposed to evaluate any potential physical adsorption loss
    onto the internal surface of cylinders. A method for estimating the amount of
    adsorption loss, the corrected amount-of-substance fraction and its uncertainty
    due to the adsorption loss is described.</p>
