abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has recently
    begun a program to develop a primary pressure standard that is based on ultra-cold
    atoms, covering a pressure range of 1  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> Pa–1  ×  10<sup>−10</sup>
    Pa and possibly lower. These pressures correspond to the entire ultra-high vacuum
    range and extend into the extreme-high vacuum. This cold-atom vacuum standard
    (CAVS) is both a primary standard and absolute sensor of vacuum. The CAVS is based
    on the loss of cold, sensor atoms (such as the alkali-metal lithium) from a magnetic
    trap due to collisions with the background gas (primarily H<sub>2</sub>) in the
    vacuum. The pressure is determined from a thermally-averaged collision cross section,
    which is a fundamental atomic property, and the measured loss rate. The CAVS is
    primary because it will use collision cross sections determined from ab initio
    calculations for the Li  +  H<sub>2</sub> system. Primary traceability is transferred
    to other systems of interest using sensitivity coefficients.</p>
