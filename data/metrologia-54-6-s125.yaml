    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology has recently begun a program to develop a primary pressure standard that is based on ultra-cold atoms, covering a pressure range of 1  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> Pa–1  ×  10<sup>−10</sup> Pa and possibly lower. These pressures correspond to the entire ultra-high vacuum range and extend into the extreme-high vacuum. This cold-atom vacuum standard (CAVS) is both a primary standard and absolute sensor of vacuum. The CAVS is based on the loss of cold, sensor atoms (such as the alkali-metal lithium) from a magnetic trap due to collisions with the background gas (primarily H<sub>2</sub>) in the vacuum. The pressure is determined from a thermally-averaged collision cross section, which is a fundamental atomic property, and the measured loss rate. The CAVS is primary because it will use collision cross sections determined from <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations for the Li  +  H<sub>2</sub> system. Primary traceability is transferred to other systems of interest using sensitivity coefficients.</p>
