abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In many calibration operations, the stimuli applied to the measuring
    system or instrument under test are derived from measurement standards whose values
    may be considered to be perfectly known. In that case, it is assumed that calibration
    uncertainty arises solely from inexact measurement of the responses, from imperfect
    control of the calibration process and from the possible inaccuracy of the calibration
    model. However, the premise that the stimuli are completely known is never strictly
    fulfilled and in some instances it may be grossly inadequate. Then, error-in-variables
    (EIV) regression models have to be employed. In metrology, these models have been
    approached mostly from the frequentist perspective. In contrast, not much guidance
    is available on their Bayesian analysis. In this paper, we first present a brief
    summary of the conventional statistical techniques that have been developed to
    deal with EIV models in calibration. We then proceed to discuss the alternative
    Bayesian framework under some simplifying assumptions. Through a detailed example
    about the calibration of an instrument for measuring flow rates, we provide advice
    on how the user of the calibration function should employ the latter framework
    for inferring the stimulus acting on the calibrated device when, in use, a certain
    response is measured.</p>
