abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When calibrating Global Positioning System (GPS) stations dedicated
    to timing, the hardware delays of P1 and P2, the P(Y)-codes on frequencies L1
    and L2, are determined separately. In the international atomic time (TAI) network
    the GPS stations of the time laboratories are calibrated relatively against reference
    stations. This paper aims at determining the consistency between the P1 and P2
    hardware delays (called dP1 and dP2) of these reference stations, and to look
    at the stability of the inter-signal hardware delays dP1–dP2 of all the stations
    in the network. The method consists of determining the dP1–dP2 directly from the
    GPS pseudorange measurements corrected for the frequency-dependent antenna phase
    center and the frequency-dependent ionosphere corrections, and then to compare
    these computed dP1–dP2 to the calibrated values.</p><p>Our results show that the
    differences between the computed and calibrated dP1–dP2 are well inside the expected
    combined uncertainty of the two quantities. Furthermore, the consistency between
    the calibrated time transfer solution obtained from either single-frequency P1
    or dual-frequency P3 for reference laboratories is shown to be about 1.0 ns, well
    inside the 2.1 ns uB uncertainty of a time transfer link based on GPS P3 or Precise
    Point Positioning. This demonstrates the good consistency between the P1 and P2
    hardware delays of the reference stations used for calibration in the TAI network.</p><p>The
    long-term stability of the inter-signal hardware delays is also analysed from
    the computed dP1–dP2. It is shown that only variations larger than 2 ns can be
    detected for a particular station, while variations of 200 ps can be detected
    when differentiating the results between two stations. Finally, we also show that
    in the differential calibration process as used in the TAI network, using the
    same antenna phase center or using different positions for L1 and L2 signals gives
    maximum differences of 200 ps on the hardware delays of the separate codes P1
    and P2; however, the final impact on the P3 combination is less than 10 ps.</p>
