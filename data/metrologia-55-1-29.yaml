    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The Consultative Committee for Mass and related quantities (<sc>ccm</sc>), of the International Committee for weights and measures (<sc>cipm</sc>), has recently declared the readiness of the community to support the redefinition of the international system of units (SI) at the next meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (<sc>cgpm</sc>) scheduled for November, 2018.</p>
    <p>Such redefinition will replace the international prototype of the Kilogram (<sc>ipk</sc>), as the definition and sole primary realization of the unit of mass, with a definition involving the Planck constant, <italic>h</italic>. This redefinition in terms of a fundamental constant of nature will enable widespread primary realizations not only of the kilogram but also of its multiples and sub-multiples, best to address the full range of practical needs in the measurement of mass.</p>
    <p>We review and discuss the statistical models and statistical data reductions, uncertainty evaluations, and substantive arguments that support the verification of several technical preconditions for the redefinition that the <sc>ccm</sc> has established, and whose verification the <sc>ccm</sc> has affirmed. These conditions relate to the accuracy and mutual consistency of qualifying measurement results.</p>
    <p>We review also an issue that has surfaced only recently, concerning the convergence toward a stable value, of the historical values that the task group on fundamental constants of the committee on Data for Science and Technology <sc>codata-tgfc</sc> has recommended for <italic>h</italic> over the years, even though the <sc>ccm</sc> has not deemed this issue to be relevant.</p>
    <p>We conclude that no statistically significant trend can be substantiated for these recommended values, but note that cumulative consensus values that may be derived from the historical measurement results for <italic>h</italic> seem to have converged while continuing to exhibit fluctuations that are typical of a process in statistical control.</p>
    <p>Finally, we argue that the most recent consensus value derived from the best measurements available for <italic>h</italic>, obtained using either a Kibble balance or the <sc>xrcd</sc> method, is reliable and has uncertainty no larger than the uncertainties surrounding the current primary and secondary realizations of the unit of mass, hence that no credible technical impediments stand in the way of the redefinition of the unit of mass in terms of a fixed value of <italic>h</italic>.</p>
