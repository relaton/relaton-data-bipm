abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Consultative Committee for Mass and related quantities (ccm),
    of the International Committee for weights and measures (cipm), has recently declared
    the readiness of the community to support the redefinition of the international
    system of units (SI) at the next meeting of the General Conference on Weights
    and Measures (cgpm) scheduled for November, 2018.</p><p>Such redefinition will
    replace the international prototype of the Kilogram (ipk), as the definition and
    sole primary realization of the unit of mass, with a definition involving the
    Planck constant, h. This redefinition in terms of a fundamental constant of nature
    will enable widespread primary realizations not only of the kilogram but also
    of its multiples and sub-multiples, best to address the full range of practical
    needs in the measurement of mass.</p><p>We review and discuss the statistical
    models and statistical data reductions, uncertainty evaluations, and substantive
    arguments that support the verification of several technical preconditions for
    the redefinition that the ccm has established, and whose verification the ccm
    has affirmed. These conditions relate to the accuracy and mutual consistency of
    qualifying measurement results.</p><p>We review also an issue that has surfaced
    only recently, concerning the convergence toward a stable value, of the historical
    values that the task group on fundamental constants of the committee on Data for
    Science and Technology codata-tgfc has recommended for h over the years, even
    though the ccm has not deemed this issue to be relevant.</p><p>We conclude that
    no statistically significant trend can be substantiated for these recommended
    values, but note that cumulative consensus values that may be derived from the
    historical measurement results for h seem to have converged while continuing to
    exhibit fluctuations that are typical of a process in statistical control.</p><p>Finally,
    we argue that the most recent consensus value derived from the best measurements
    available for h, obtained using either a Kibble balance or the xrcd method, is
    reliable and has uncertainty no larger than the uncertainties surrounding the
    current primary and secondary realizations of the unit of mass, hence that no
    credible technical impediments stand in the way of the redefinition of the unit
    of mass in terms of a fixed value of h.</p>
