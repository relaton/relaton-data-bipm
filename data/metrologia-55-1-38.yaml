    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Johnson noise thermometry is of considerable interest at present due to the planned redefinition of the kelvin in 2019, and several determinations of the Boltzmann constant have recently been published in support of the redefinition. To determine the Boltzmann constant by noise thermometry, the thermal noise from a sensing resistor at the triple point of water is compared to a pseudo-random noise with a calculable power spectral density traceable to quantum electrical standards. In all the measurements to date, the two dominant sources of measurement uncertainty are strongly influenced by a single factor: the frequency-response mismatch between the sets of leads connecting the thermometer to the two noise sources. In the most recent determination at the National Institute of Metrology, China, substantial changes were made to the connecting leads to reduce the mismatch effects. The aims of this paper are, firstly, to describe and explain the rationale for the changes, and secondly, to better understand the effects of the least-squares fits and the bias-variance compromise in the analysis of measurements affected by the mismatch effects. While significant improvements can be made to the connecting leads to lessen the effects of the frequency-response mismatch, the efforts are unlikely to be rewarded by a significant increase in bandwidth or a significant reduction in uncertainty.</p>
