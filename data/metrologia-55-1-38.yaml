abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Johnson noise thermometry is of considerable interest at present
    due to the planned redefinition of the kelvin in 2019, and several determinations
    of the Boltzmann constant have recently been published in support of the redefinition.
    To determine the Boltzmann constant by noise thermometry, the thermal noise from
    a sensing resistor at the triple point of water is compared to a pseudo-random
    noise with a calculable power spectral density traceable to quantum electrical
    standards. In all the measurements to date, the two dominant sources of measurement
    uncertainty are strongly influenced by a single factor: the frequency-response
    mismatch between the sets of leads connecting the thermometer to the two noise
    sources. In the most recent determination at the National Institute of Metrology,
    China, substantial changes were made to the connecting leads to reduce the mismatch
    effects. The aims of this paper are, firstly, to describe and explain the rationale
    for the changes, and secondly, to better understand the effects of the least-squares
    fits and the bias-variance compromise in the analysis of measurements affected
    by the mismatch effects. While significant improvements can be made to the connecting
    leads to lessen the effects of the frequency-response mismatch, the efforts are
    unlikely to be rewarded by a significant increase in bandwidth or a significant
    reduction in uncertainty.</p>'
