abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In precision metrology, the determination of the Newtonian gravity
    constant G represents a real problem, since its history is plagued by huge unknown
    discrepancies between a large number of independent experiments. In this paper,
    we propose a novel experimental setup for measuring G with a relative accuracy
    of 10−5, using a standard cold atomic fountain and matter wave interferometry.
    We discuss in detail the major sources of systematic errors, and provide the expected
    statistical uncertainty. The feasibility of determining G at the 10−6 level is
    also discussed.</p>
