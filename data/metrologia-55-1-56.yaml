abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The x-ray atomic properties of nickel (Ni) were investigated
    in a unique approach combining different experimental techniques to obtain new,
    useful and reliable values of atomic fundamental parameters for x-ray spectrometric
    purposes and for comparison with theoretical predictions. We determined the mass
    attenuation coefficients in an energy range covering the L- and K-absorption edges,
    the K-shell fluorescence yield and the Kβ/Kα and Kβ1,3/Kα1,2 transition probability
    ratios. The obtained line profiles and linewidths of the Kα and Kβ transitions
    in Ni can be considered as the contribution of the satellite lines arising from
    the [KM] shake processes suggested by Deutsch et al (1995 Phys. Rev. A 51 283)
    and Ito et al (2016 Phys. Rev. A 94 042506). Comparison of the new data with several
    databases showed good agreement, but also discrepancies were found with existing
    tabulated values.</p>
