abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a method to measure the temperature along the path
    of an optical interferometer based on the propagation of acoustic waves. It exploits
    the high sensitivity of the speed of sound to air temperature. In particular,
    it takes advantage of a technique where the generation of acoustic waves is synchronous
    with the amplitude modulation of a laser source. A photodetector converts the
    laser light into an electronic signal used as a reference, while the incoming
    acoustic waves are focused on a microphone and generate the measuring signal.
    Under this condition, the phase difference between the two signals substantially
    depends on the temperature of the air volume interposed between the sources and
    the receivers. A comparison with traditional temperature sensors highlighted the
    limit of the latter in the case of fast temperature variations and the advantage
    of a measurement integrated along the optical path instead of a sampling measurement.
    The capability of the acoustic method to compensate for the interferometric distance
    measurements due to air temperature variations has been demonstrated to the level
    of 0.1 °C corresponding to 10<sup>−7</sup> on the refractive index of air. We
    applied the method indoor for distances up to 27 m, outdoor at 78 m and finally
    tested the acoustic thermometer over a distance of 182 m.</p>
