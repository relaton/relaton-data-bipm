abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Kibble balance is expected to become an important instrument
    in the near future for realizing the unit of mass, the kilogram, in the revised
    international system of units (SI). The Kibble balance assumes an equality of
    two magnetic profiles measured in the weighing and velocity phases. A recent study
    conducted in the Kibble balance group at the Bureau International des Poids et
    Mesures (BIPM) showed that the coil current could significantly affect the magnetic
    profile, which should be carefully taken into account in the Kibble balance experiment.
    This paper gives a deeper understanding and investigation of the effect, and discusses
    the magnetic profile change due to the coil current, for both the classical two-mode
    and the one-mode Kibble balances. The coil current effect has been theoretically
    and experimentally investigated based on a typical magnet design with an air gap.
    One important conclusion found in the one-mode Kibble balance is that the magnetic
    profile change measured in the velocity phase is twice the change in the weighing
    phase. A compensation suggestion, to minimize the profile change due to the coil
    current in a BIPM-type magnet, is presented.</p>
