abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a way of constructing an uncertainty budget
    for root mean square (RMS) voltage measurement with an integrating sampling voltmeter
    and a discreet Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. The construction of an uncertainty
    budget based on the Monte Carlo method is proposed. Such a budget makes it possible
    to analyse metrological properties of RMS measurement, especially in cases difficult
    to realize by the classical method of uncertainty determination. An application
    of the proposed research method is illustrated by voltage RMS measurement with
    a high-accuracy HP3458A sampling voltmeter. Selected simulation results have been
    experimentally verified.</p>
