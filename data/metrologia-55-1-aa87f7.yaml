abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A primary calibration method is demonstrated to obtain the magnitude
    and phase of the complex sensitivity for a hydrophone at frequencies between 1
    Hz and 2 kHz. The measurement is performed in a coupler reciprocity chamber (‘coupler’);
    a closed test chamber where time harmonic oscillations in pressure can be achieved
    and the reciprocity conditions required for a primary calibration can be realized.
    Relevant theory is reviewed and the reciprocity parameter updated for the complex
    measurement. Systematic errors and corrections for magnitude are reviewed and
    more added for phase. The combined expanded uncertainties of the magnitude and
    phase of the complex sensitivity at 1 Hz were 0.1 dB re 1 V μPa−1 and  ±1∘, respectively.
    Complex sensitivity, sensitivity magnitude, and phase measurements are presented
    on an example primary reference hydrophone.</p>
