abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This paper describes the degree of equivalence between low-shock
    and centrifuge calibrations up to 10 000 m s<sup>−2</sup> against three types
    of piezoresistive accelerometer: an undamped sputter gauge type, a damped sputter
    gauge type and an undamped semiconductive type. The complex sensitivity in the
    low-shock calibration and the DC sensitivity in the centrifuge calibration are
    well consistent within each expanded uncertainty in the frequency domain, together
    with the vibration calibration using the second-order transfer function. In addition,
    the preliminary uncertainty budget in the centrifuge calibration facility is also
    indicated, and distinctly estimated from the viewpoint of the mechanical parts
    and accelerometers.</p>'
