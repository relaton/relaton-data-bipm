abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A thin-film resistance temperature detector (RTD) array is proposed
    to measure the temperature distribution inside a phantom. HIFU (high-intensity
    focused ultrasound) is a non-invasive treatment method using focused ultrasound
    to heat up a localized region, so it is important to measure the temperature distribution
    without affecting the ultrasonic field and heat conduction. The present 25 µm
    thick PI (polyimide) film is transparent not only to an ultrasonic field, because
    its thickness is much smaller than the wavelength of ultrasound, but also to heat
    conduction, owing to its negligible thermal mass compared to the phantom. A total
    of 33 RTDs consisting of Pt resistors and interconnection lines were patterned
    on a PI substrate using MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) technology, and
    a polymer phantom was fabricated with the film at the center. The expanded uncertainty
    of the RTDs was 0.8 K. In the experimental study using a 1 MHz HIFU transducer,
    the maximum temperature inside the phantom was measured as 70.1 °C just after
    a HIFU excitation of 6.4 W for 180 s. The time responses of the RTDs at different
    positions also showed the residual heat transfer inside the phantom after HIFU
    excitation. HIFU results with the phantom showed that a thin-film RTD array can
    measure the temperature distribution inside a phantom.</p>
