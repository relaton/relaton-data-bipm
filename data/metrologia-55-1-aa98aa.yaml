abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Weighted least-squares estimation is commonly applied in metrology
    to fit models to measurements that are accompanied with quoted uncertainties.
    The weights are chosen in dependence on the quoted uncertainties. However, when
    data and model are inconsistent in view of the quoted uncertainties, this procedure
    does not yield adequate results.</p><p>When it can be assumed that all uncertainties
    ought to be rescaled by a common factor, weighted least-squares estimation may
    still be used, provided that a simple correction of the uncertainty obtained for
    the estimated model is applied. We show that these uncertainties and credible
    intervals are robust, as they do not rely on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution
    of the data. Hence, common software for weighted least-squares estimation may
    still safely be employed in such a case, followed by a simple modification of
    the uncertainties obtained by that software. We also provide means of checking
    the assumptions of such an approach.</p><p>The Bayesian regression procedure is
    applied to analyze the CODATA values for the Planck constant published over the
    past decades in terms of three different models: a constant model, a straight
    line model and a spline model. Our results indicate that the CODATA values may
    not have yet stabilized.</p>'
