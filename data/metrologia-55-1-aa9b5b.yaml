abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When calibrating Global Positioning System (GPS) stations dedicated
    to timing, the hardware delays of  P 1 and  P 2, the  P ( Y )-codes on frequencies  L
    1 and  L 2, are determined separately. In the international atomic time (TAI)
    network the GPS stations of the time laboratories are calibrated relatively against
    reference stations. This paper aims at determining the consistency between the  P
    1 and  P 2 hardware delays (called d P 1 and d P 2) of these reference stations,
    and to look at the stability of the inter-signal hardware delays d P 1–d P 2 of
    all the stations in the network. The method consists of determining the d P 1–d
    P 2 directly from the GPS pseudorange measurements corrected for the frequency-dependent
    antenna phase center and the frequency-dependent ionosphere corrections, and then
    to compare these computed d P 1–d P 2 to the calibrated values.</p><p>Our results
    show that the differences between the computed and calibrated d P 1–d P 2 are
    well inside the expected combined uncertainty of the two quantities. Furthermore,
    the consistency between the calibrated time transfer solution obtained from either
    single-frequency  P 1 or dual-frequency  P 3 for reference laboratories is shown
    to be about 1.0 ns, well inside the 2.1 ns uB uncertainty of a time transfer link
    based on GPS  P 3 or Precise Point Positioning. This demonstrates the good consistency
    between the  P 1 and  P 2 hardware delays of the reference stations used for calibration
    in the TAI network.</p><p>The long-term stability of the inter-signal hardware
    delays is also analysed from the computed d P 1–d P 2. It is shown that only variations
    larger than 2 ns can be detected for a particular station, while variations of
    200 ps can be detected when differentiating the results between two stations.
    Finally, we also show that in the differential calibration process as used in
    the TAI network, using the same antenna phase center or using different positions
    for  L 1 and  L 2 signals gives maximum differences of 200 ps on the hardware
    delays of the separate codes  P 1 and  P 2; however, the final impact on the  P
    3 combination is less than 10 ps.</p>
