abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We develop a relativistic treatment of interference between
    light reflected from a falling cube retroreflector in the vertical arm of an interferometer,
    and light in a reference beam in the horizontal arm. Coordinates that are nearly
    Minkowskian, attached to the falling cube, are used to describe the propagation
    of light within the cube. Relativistic effects such as the dependence of the coordinate
    speed of light on gravitational potential, propagation of light along null geodesics,
    relativity of simultaneity, and Lorentz contraction of the moving cube, are accounted
    for. The calculation is carried to first order in the gradient of the acceleration
    of gravity. Analysis of data from a falling cube gravimeter shows that the propagation
    time of light within the cube itself causes a significant reduction in the value
    of the acceleration of gravity obtained from measurements, compared to assuming
    reflection occurs at the face. An expression for the correction to g is derived
    and found to agree with experiment. Depending on the instrument, the correction
    can be several microgals, comparable to commonly applied corrections such as those
    due to polar motion and earth tides. The controversial ‘speed of light’ correction
    is discussed.</p>
