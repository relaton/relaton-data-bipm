abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This note reviews previous analyses by the author of the damping
    produced by the anelasticity of a simple flexure element that is loaded in tension
    by an extended object such as a beam balance. The correct calculation of the anelasticity
    of a simple flexure appeared in an appendix in Quinn et al (1995 Phys. Lett. A
    197 197) where the change in the gravitational potential energy due to the shortening
    of the flexure was calculated enabling expressions for the elastic energy and
    its associated losses to be derived. Publications prior to this paper did not
    include this lossless term which led to incorrect predictions of the anelastic
    losses in flexure pivots in Quinn et al (1992 Phil. Mag. A 65 261â€“76). In this
    current paper the derivation of the result is given in such a way that it can
    be easily contrasted with the expressions in these earlier papers. I also extend
    the methodology to calculate the elastic and gravitational energy associated with
    the motion of a suspended object whose dimensions are significantly smaller than
    the length of the flexure.</p>
