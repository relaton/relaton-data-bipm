abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Scattering parameters are fundamental quantities in radio frequency
    and microwave metrology. Traceability to SI units for these measurements is established
    with the help of calculable standards. Progress has been made over recent years
    in characterizing these standards. Major steps forward have been achieved with
    advanced modelling of the entire standard, including connector interface and with
    the use of multivariate uncertainty evaluation, taking correlations fully into
    account. The improvements have led to more consistent, more accurate measurements.</p>
