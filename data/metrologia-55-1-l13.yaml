abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Sufficient progress towards redefining the International System
    of Units (SI) in terms of exact values of fundamental constants has been achieved.
    Exact values of the Planck constant h, elementary charge e, Boltzmann constant
    k, and Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub> from the CODATA 2017 Special Adjustment
    of the Fundamental Constants are presented here. These values are recommended
    to the 26th General Conference on Weights and Measures to form the foundation
    of the revised SI.</p>
