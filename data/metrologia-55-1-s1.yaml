abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Physics-based computer models, such as fluid flow simulations,
    seek to approximate the behavior of a real system based on the physical equations
    that govern the evolution of that system. The model approximation of reality,
    however, is imperfect because it is subject to uncertainties coming from different
    sources: finite model resolution, uncertainty in model parameter values, uncertainty
    in input data such as external forgings, and uncertainty in the structure of the
    model itself. Many studies to date have considered the effects of parameter and
    data uncertainty on model outputs, and have offered solutions to obtain the best
    fitted parameter values for a model. However, much less effort has been devoted
    to the study of structural uncertainty, which is caused by our incomplete knowledge
    about the true physical processes, and manifests itself as missing dynamics in
    the model. This paper seeks to understand structural uncertainty by studying the
    observable errors, i.e. the discrepancies between the model solutions and measurements
    of the physical system. The dynamics of these errors is modeled using a state-space
    approach, which enables one to identify the source of uncertainty and to recognize
    the missing dynamics inside model. Furthermore, the model solution can be improved
    by correcting it with the error predicted by the state-space approach. The proposed
    methodology is applied to two test problems, Lorenz-96 and a stratospheric chemistry
    model.</p>'
