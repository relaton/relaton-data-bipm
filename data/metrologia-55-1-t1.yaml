abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The definition of the kilogram in the International System of
    Units (SI) is expected to be revised in 2018. The present definition of the kilogram,
    the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), adopted in 1889,
    would then be replaced by a definition based on a fixed numerical value of the
    Planck constant. The Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities has
    requested that, as one of the essential steps before the redefinition, a comparison
    of kilogram realizations based on future realization methods, Kibble balances
    and x-ray crystal density (XRCD) experiments, be organized.</p><p>This comparison
    was carried out during 2016 in the form of a ‘Pilot Study’. One aim of the study
    was to determine the uniformity of mass dissemination after the redefinition by
    comparing mass calibrations based on different future realization experiments.
    Another aim was to test the continuity of the mass unit across the redefinition
    by comparing mass calibrations based on Kibble balances and XRCD experiments with
    those based on the IPK. This paper describes the organization of the comparison
    and presents its results.</p>
