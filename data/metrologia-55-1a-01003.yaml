    <p>The supplementary comparison report APMP.EM.RF-S21.F describes the comparison of loop antennas, which was conducted between April 2013 and January 2014. The two comparison artefacts were well-characterised active loop antennas of diameter 30 cm and 60 cm respectively, which typically operate in a frequency range from 9 kHz to 30 MHz. These antennas represent the main groups of antennas which are used around the world for EMC measurements in the frequency range below 30 MHz. There are several well-known methods for calibrating the antenna factor of these devices.</p>
    <p>The calibration systems used in this comparison for the loop antennas employed the standard magnetic field method or the three-antenna method. Despite the limitations of the algorithm, which we used to derive the reference value for each case (particularly for small samples), the actual calculated reference values seem to be reasonable. As a result, the agreement between each participant was very good in all cases.</p>
