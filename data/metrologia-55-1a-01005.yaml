    <p>The 14th Meeting of the APMP Technical Committee on Electricity and Magnetism, held on 5 December 2011 in Kobe, Japan, decided to hold a comparison of standards for the calibration of voltage, current and resistance meters at the lowest attainable level of uncertainty. Our comparison, designated APMP.EM-S12, covered the parameters and ranges that would typically be measured during the calibration of digital multimeters in electrical laboratories. The instrument selected for the comparison was a Wavetek model 4950 Multifunction Transfer Standard.</p>
    <p>Circulation of the travelling standard started in February 2015 and the comparison concluded in October 2016. Between each of the comparison rounds the travelling standard was returned to the National Measurement Institute, Australia (NMIA). The dependence of the instrument on temperature and humidity was determined before the start of the comparison. The drift of the instrument during the comparison was determined from measurements at the NMIA. Participant results were corrected for temperature and drift.</p>
    <p>Comparison reference values were calculated from all participant results that survived outlier detection. Most of the results show good agreement with the comparison reference values.</p>
