    <p>The unit magnetic power loss is essential for the development and optimization of soft magnetic materials for electromagnetic generators and engines. For the maintenance of the corresponding measuring systems in accordance to IEC 60404 it is necessary to compare the measurement facilities used by the NMIs involved. Since the last comparison has been accomplished in 1999 and the request for precise values for many of the actual applications is increasing in 2015 the decision was made to start a new international comparison. The work was done in the framework of the supplementary comparison 1337 EURAMET.EM.M.S2. Four NMIs of EURAMET and one NMI of COOMET took part to get information about their equipment used for the measurement of the magnetic power loss. A selection of a variety of samples was used. One grain-oriented, one homogenous Epstein-sample, one grain oriented, and one homogenous ring kernel where send to the NMIs to measure the specific power loss. After the evaluation of the data in agreement with the rules of EURAMET the results of the NMIs participating in the comparison can be judged as concerted which is an objective confirmation of the declared uncertainties. Only one partner should improve his equipment or widen the range of uncertainty.</p>
