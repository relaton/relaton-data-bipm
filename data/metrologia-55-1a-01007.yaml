abstract:
- content: "<p></p><p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and
    b, a comparison of the 1.018 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM
    and the Kenya Bureau of Standards, was carried out from January to February 2017.
    Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_A (Z8) and
    BIPM_B (ZB), were hand carried to KEBS and back to BIPM by M. Gibosn Aguko. Since
    the total duration of the travels from one institute to the other was not exceeding
    the capabilities of the self-powering of the Zeners (36 hours), the transfer standards
    did not need any additional battery connected in parallel to the internal battery.
    At KEBS, the reference standard for DC voltage is a 732B Zener standard traceable
    to a primary voltage by means of a calibration service requested once a year from
    a National Measurement Institute (UME, Turkey) operating a Josephson Voltage Standard
    (JVS) two times per year. The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling
    standard was measured against the Zener voltage standard by means of an accurate
    multimeter.</p><p>At the BIPM, the travelling standards were calibrated, before
    and after the measurements at KEBS, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results
    of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of
    the Zener standards on internal temperature and atmospheric pressure.Since KEBS
    did not record the temperature of the internal voltage reference during its measurement
    session, no correction for the Zener temperature dependence was applied. However,
    as a consequence the related uncertainty was adjusted.</p><p>The final result
    of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned to
    DC voltage standards by KEBS, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at KEBS, U<sub>KEBS</sub>,
    and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference
    dates of the 2 February 2018.</p><p>\n \n U<sub>KEBS</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub>
    = + 0.11 µV; u<sub>c</sub> = 0.34 µV, at 1.018 V</p><p>\n \n U<sub>KEBS</sub>
    - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = + 0.25 µV; u<sub>c</sub> = 1.55 µV, at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub>
    is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference,
    including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at
    KEBS, based on KJ-90, and the uncertainty related to the comparison. KEBS' uncertainties
    appear to be over estimated and would require revision.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Josephson
