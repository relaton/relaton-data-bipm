    <p></p><p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance between the NSAI-NML (Ireland) and the BIPM carried out in 2018. Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then also for a period of about one month at the NSAI-NML, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13.b (for 10 kΩ).</p><p>The results from the NSAI-NML and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence, k = 2) of 0.17 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 1 Ω and 0.43 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Resistance; ohm; NSAI-NML; Ireland; BIPM; CIPM MRA; comparison; K13; electricity</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
