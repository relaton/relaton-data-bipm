    <p>During the 18th APMP meeting in 2004, TCPR agreed that the luminous flux should be one of the several regional comparisons to be conducted in the field of photometry and radiometry, and the project was named as APMP.PR-K4. Nine laboratories took part in this comparison. A group of LF 200W lamps (no less than three) was used as transfer artifacts by each participant. The National Institute of Metrology (NIM, China) acted as the pilot laboratory. Presented in this report are the detailed procedures and results of the work.</p>
