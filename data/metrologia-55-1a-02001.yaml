abstract:
- content: "<p>During the 18th APMP meeting in 2004, TCPR agreed that the luminous
    flux should be one of the several regional comparisons to be conducted in the
    field of photometry and radiometry, and the project was named as APMP.PR-K4. Nine
    laboratories took part in this comparison. A group of LF 200W lamps (no less than
    three) was used as transfer artifacts by each participant. The National Institute
    of Metrology (NIM, China) acted as the pilot laboratory. Presented in this report
    are the detailed procedures and results of the work.</p><p>Main text</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
