    <p>NIST (USA) and INMETRO (Brazil) performed a bilateral supplementary comparison of cryogenic radiometers. The subject of this comparison is to give metrological equivalence to the measurement of optical power performed at Inmetro, using the reference value of this quantity derived from CCPRâ€“S3 comparison. Each NMI provided two detectors - silicon-based 3-photodiode, reflectance trap detectors - for this bilateral comparison. Those detectors were measured at nominal wavelengths of 457.9 nm and 514.5 nm of Ar<sup>+</sup>; 632.8 nm of HeNe by each laboratory. The results for both institutes agree under the normalized error criterion. The results of this comparison also show agreement with a combined standard uncertainty of 6.1 parts per 10<sup>4</sup> and the differences to the CCPR-S3 reference value were -1.7 and -6.1 parts in 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>
