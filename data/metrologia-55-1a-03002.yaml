    <p></p><p>APMP.T-K7.1, was held from July 2014 to May 2015 to compare the national realizations of the water triple point between NMIJ (Japan) and VMI (Vietnam). To reach the objective, VMI sent a transfer cell to NMIJ and stated a value for the temperature difference of the transfer cell, relative to the corresponding national standard, representing 273.16 K.</p><p>This report presents the results of the TPW comparison, gives detailed information about the measurements made at the NMIJ and at the VMI, and aims to link the results of APMP.T-K7.1 to APMP.T-K7 and CCT-K7. The results of this key comparison are also represented in the form of degrees of equivalence for the purposes of the MRA.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
