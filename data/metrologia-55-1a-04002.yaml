    <p>A reginal supplementary comparison, APMP.L-S8, was started in 2015 to demonstrate the equivalence of routine calibration services offered by NMIs to clients. Participants in this APMP.L-S8 comparison agreed to apply interferometric method for flatness measurement of the optical flats. There are two configurations of flatness interferometer used in this comparison, vertical type and horizontal type. There are seven laboratories from NMIs participated this supplementary comparison which included NIMT, NMIJ, NIM, NMC/A*STAR, MSL, NPLI and NMISA.</p>
    <p>This report describes the measurement results of two optical flats, diameter of 70 mm and 160 mm. The calibrations of this comparison were carried out by participants during the period from July 2015 to September 2016. The results show that there is a degree of equivalence below 1 for all measurands. Hence, there is a close agreement between the measurements from all participants.</p>
