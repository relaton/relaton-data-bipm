    <p></p><p>A laser from one national metrological institute (NMI) was compared in 2017 as part of the CCL-K11 on-going key comparison, initiated by the 13th meeting of the Comité Consultative des Longueurs (CCL) in 2007. The absolute frequency of R(127) 11-5 transitions of molecular iodine was measured following the technical protocol for CCL-K11. The result of this measurement is compiled in the present report. The comparison report, as communicated by the participant, is included as an appendix.</p><p>This document constitutes the ninth final report for the on-going key comparison CCL-K11.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
