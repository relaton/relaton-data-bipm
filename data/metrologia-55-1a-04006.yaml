    <p></p><p>In 2015, a supplementary comparison of flatness standards, COOMET.L-S15, was started, the goal of comparisons was to establish the degree of equivalence of national standards. The participants of the comparison carry out, on their national standards, measuring a reference standard with a diameter of 120 mm, a thickness of 30 mm (hereinafter referred to as measure) in accordance with the requirements of the technical protocol section "Instructions for conducting measurements" and instructions for working with national standards. In this additional comparison, three laboratories VNIIMS, BelGIM, NSC "IM" participated.</p><p>The measurements were conducted by the participants between July 2015 and the end of 2017. All values of the criterion En for the measure of deviation from the flatness of the participants of the comparisons are below the established level |En| â‰¤ 1. Therefore, there is a close agreement between the measurements of all participants.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>flatness, interferometer readings, deviation</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
