    <p></p><p>The COOMET Project No 658/BY/15 "Comparison of profiles of measuring bridges", KCDB Reference COOMET.L-S19, was organized by TC 1.5 "Length and Angle" of COOMET. This comparison started in September 2015 and finished in November 2016. It was piloted by the Belarusian State Institute of Metrology (BelGIM), Minsk, the Republic of Belarus with other participants as follows UNIIM (Russia), SKS RSE KazInMetr (Kazakhstan).</p><p>The aim of the project is to determine the degree of equivalence of national measurement standards of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan in the field of measurement of straightness and flatness deviations and to support the measurement capabilities claimed by the comparison participants.</p><p>Comparison scheme: round robin. The comparison principle is as follows: the comparison participants shall make tenfold measurements in 100-mm steps to determine profile straightness deviations of solid-stone bridges maintained at BelGIM, UNIIM and SKS RSE KazInMetr by using measuring instruments being the parts of their respective measurement standards.</p><p>The results of the measurements conducted by the comparison participants were verified by using the following two methods: based on the En-criterion and based on the degree of equivalence of the measurement standards.</p><p>The comparison results help to support the calibraton and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the laboratories involved in the CIPM MRA.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>measuring bridges, solid-stone bridge, deviation, COOMET, CIPM MRA, BIPM KCDB</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
