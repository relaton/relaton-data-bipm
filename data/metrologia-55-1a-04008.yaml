    <p>In 2016 this comparison was initialised to validate the CMC entries of the national metrology institutes (NMI) of Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. The German NMI, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), was identified as the pilot laboratory, responsible for planning, organizing and analysing the comparison. Moreover, the calibration values of PTB were used as reference values for this comparison because the PTB is the only participant in the presented comparison who has successfully participated in the latest international comparison on gears EURAMET.L-S24. All participants were asked to measure three different gear standards specialized for profile, helix and pitch measurements.</p>
    <p>The comparison was registered as the supplementary comparison COOMET.L-S18. The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL WG-MRA, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
    <p>Comparison measurement, gears, profile, helix, pitch, measurement uncertainty, CMC claims</p>
