- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Instituto Superior Técnico, Laboratório de Proteção e Segurança Radiológica (IST-LPSR), Portugal and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in December 2015. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the IST-LPSR and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0026 with a combined standard uncertainty of 1.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The results for an indirect comparison made at the same time are consistent with the direct results at the level of 1.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
