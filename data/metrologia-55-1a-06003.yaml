- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Slovak Institute of Metrology (SMU), Slovakia and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in June 2017. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the SMU and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0042 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.7 × 10<sup>−3</sup>. The results for an indirect comparison made at the same time are consistent with the direct results at the level of 2 parts in 10<sup>4</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
