    <p></p>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to water standards of the PTB, Germany and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in general agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 9 to 11 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are combined with those of a EURAMET comparison and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
