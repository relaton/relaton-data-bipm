    <p>A supplementary comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NRPA, Norway, the STUK, Finland, the SSM, Sweden and the LNE-LNHB, France in the medium-energy x-ray range. The technical protocol was approved by the CCRI(I) in April 2016. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 4.4, 9.1 and 4.5 parts in 10³ for the NRPA, STUK and the SSM, respectively. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence.</p>
