    <p>A supplementary comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NRPA, Norway, the STUK, Finland, the SSM, Sweden and the LNE-LNHB, France in the low-energy x-ray range, and between the NRPA and the LNE-LNHB in the mammography x-ray range. The technical protocol was approved by the CCRI(I) in April 2016. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 6.8, 10.0 and 7.4 parts in 10³ for the NRPA, the STUK and the SSM respectively. For mammography, the standard uncertainty was 5.3 parts in 103 for the NRPA. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence.</p>
