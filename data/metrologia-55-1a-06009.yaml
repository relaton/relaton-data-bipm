- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A supplementary comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NRPA (Norway), the STUK (Finland) the SSM (Sweden) and the LNE-LNHB (France) in the ISO 4037 narrow spectrum series in the range 40 kV to 300 kV. The technical protocol was approved by the CCRI(I) in April 2016. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of 12, 14 and 8 parts in 10³ for the NRPA, the STUK and the SSM respectively. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Supplementary comparison, air kerma, narrow spectrum series, radiation dosimetry</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
