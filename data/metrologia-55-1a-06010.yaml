    <p></p><p>A bilateral comparison of standards for absorbed dose to water and air kerma of the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen (BEV), Austria, and of the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences (VINS), Serbia, has been carried out. It was performed for air kerma and for absorbed dose to water in<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beams and for air kerma in<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beams.</p><p>Transfer standards for air kerma and absorbed dose to water were exchanged by the participants. The participants determined the calibration coefficients of the transfer standards through comparison with their national standards in their respective<sup>60</sup>Co and<sup>137</sup>Cs beams.</p><p>The ratios of the calibration coefficients for the BEV and VINS transfer standards were calculated. The results were 0.9990 for absorbed dose to water in a<sup>60</sup>Co beam at therapy level, 1.0004 for air kerma in a<sup>60</sup>Co beam at therapy level, and 0.9926 for air kerma in a<sup>137</sup>Cs beam at radiation protection level.</p><p>A connection to the key comparison data base (KCDB) is given as the results are linked to the key comparisons between the BEV and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in 2009. Detailed uncertainty budgets and graphical presentations are also included.</p><p>The project has been registered in the BIPM key Comparison Data Base (KCDB) as three different comparisons:</p><p>– EURAMET.RI(I)-K1.2: Air Kerma measured in<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beams</p><p>– EURAMET.RI(I)-K4.2: Absorbed Dose to Water measured in<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beams</p><p>– EURAMET.RI(I)-K5.1: Air Kerma measured in<sup>137</sup>Cs radiation beams</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Dosimetry, comparison, air kerma, absorbed dose to water, Austria, Serbia, EURAMET, ionizing radiation, CIPM MRA, BIPM KCDB</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
