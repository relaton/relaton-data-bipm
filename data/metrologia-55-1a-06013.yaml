    <p>A key comparison of the standards for air kerma of VSL, Dutch Metrology Institute, The Netherlands (VSL) and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in December 2017. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the VSL and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9963 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.1 x 10<sup>-3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
