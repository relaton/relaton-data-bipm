    <p>A supplementary comparison was performed in order to compare national measurement systems to determine volume of liquids, particularly at fixed volume of 20 L. The participants were CENAM (Mexico), LACOMET (Costa Rica) and RECOPE (Costa Rica). The measurements were carried out from October 2016 to June 2017. The chosen value of volume (20 L) is representative of the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) declared by the three participants. The transfer standard (TS) was a stainless steel pipette for volume at 20 L. Prior to the beginning of the comparison, the TS was tested by CENAM. The results of the test phase showed excellent values for both repeatability and reproducibility. During the SIM.M.FF-S12, the results of the laboratories showed good agreement with the reference values. The best estimation of the measurands, as reported by the participants, showed a ± 0.0022 % as the largest difference among the laboratories.</p>
