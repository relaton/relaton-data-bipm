    <p>Bilateral comparison was organized between the laboratory for process measurement of the Croatian Metrology Institute (HMI/FSB-LPM) and the pressure laboratory of the Directorate of Measures and Precious Metals of the Republic of Serbia (DMDM). Laboratory for process measurement of HMI acted as the pilot laboratory. The aim of the comparison was to evaluate the degree of equivalence in the determination of effective area and elastic distortion coefficient, considering respective uncertainties of the two laboratories. Measurements were done on the pressure balance in gauge mode, with oil as transmitting medium, in the gauge pressure range 10â€“80 MPa. The results of the comparison successfully demonstrated that the hydraulic gauge pressure standards are equivalent within their claimed uncertainties.</p>
