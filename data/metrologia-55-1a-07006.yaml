    <p>This report describes the results of bilateral inter laboratory comparison (BILC) denoted as COOMET.M.P-S5 (also known as supplementary comparison COOMET 723/AZ/17). The comparison measurements between the two participants, Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) (pilot laboratory) and Azerbaijan İnstitute of Metrology (AzMI), started in April 2017 and finished in June 2017. The transfer standards was a digital manometer, Crystal XP 2i with the gauge pressure range (0–34000) kPa.</p>
