    <p>This report describes the result of an Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) regional comparison of 50 kg stainless steel mass standard carried out among three laboratories as a collaboration among inter-Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) programs. One weight of nominal value 50 kg has been prepared by CENAM (Mexico) of Sistema Interamericano de MetrologÃ­a (SIM) for this APMP comparison as an international collaboration. The reported results by participants are consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of comparison, CCM.M-K6 to which this comparison has been linked</p>
