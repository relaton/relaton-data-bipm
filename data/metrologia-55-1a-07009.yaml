    <p></p><p>The purpose of this comparison was to perform a bilateral comparison between IPQ—Portugal and INTI—Argentina, in order to test the agreement of their results and uncertainties in the calibration of micropipettes despite the different equipment used and calibration process. In order to access the stability of the micropipettes, INTI preformed two measurements: one at the beginning and another at the end of the comparison. The measurements were carried out from September 2017 to November 2017.</p><p>The type of micropipette suggested for this comparison was the single-channel piston pipette, which was the most common used in laboratories and easy to handle. Each laboratory had to calibrate a fixed volume micropipette of 50 μl and a variable volume micropipette of 1000 μl in 1000 μl, 500 μl, 100 μl. For the variable micropipette all results for both laboratories were consistent with the reference value obtained by the weighted mean.</p><p>The fixed micropipette was damaged during the transportation between laboratories and therefore the results cannot be used.</p><p>The value of the expanded uncertainty is quite similar for the higher volumes but there are some differences in the values of the uncertainty components. The uncertainty component that has a major contribution to the final uncertainty is the handling for IPQ and the temperature difference between water and pipette for INTI.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
