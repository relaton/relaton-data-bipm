    <p>This report describes the third CCM key comparison in capillary viscometry at twelve National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), which was carried out between October 2012 and February 2013. Seven NMIs, which do not maintain an independent viscosity scale, also took part in this comparison. Three samples of Newtonian liquids with nominal kinematic viscosities of 6 mm²/s at 15 °C and 5 mm²/s at 20 °C, 2000 mm²/s at 20 °C and 500 mm²/s at 40 °C, and 160000 mm²/s at 20 °C and 25000 mm²/s at 40 °C prepared by NMIJ were provided to each of the NMIs. For each of these liquids at two temperatures, total number of 98 measurements was carried out and from the results of viscosity measurements, the key comparison reference values (KCRVs) for six data sets were determined. The degrees of equivalences was evaluated by difference from the KCRV and, with a few exceptions, these differences were almost equal to or less than expanded uncertainties, showing a good equivalencies of capabilities at the participating NMIs for the viscosity measurements in wide range of viscosities covered from 5 mm²/s to 160000 mm²/s.</p>
