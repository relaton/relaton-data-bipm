    <p></p><p>A comparison of volume standards was undertaken between CEM (ES), NPL (UK), PTB (DE), and INM (RO). For the comparison three silicon spheres are used as transfer standards with masses 1 kg (provided by PTB), 30 g (provided by PTB) and 125 g (provided by NPL).</p><p>The aim of the EURAMET.M.D-S3 solid density comparison is to compare the results of the density (and volume and mass) determinations of solid samples of the participating laboratories and to evaluate the degrees of equivalence according to the Mutual Recognition Arrangement. The reference conditions for density and volume determination were 20 °C and 101 325 Pa.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Density, silicon sphere, Monte Carlo, comparison</p><p></p><p> Main text</p><p>
