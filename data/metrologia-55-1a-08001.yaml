    <p>As part of the on-going key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has been performed between the ozone national standard of South Africa maintained by the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA) and the common reference standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), via a transfer standard maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone amount-of-substance fraction range of 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol.</p>
