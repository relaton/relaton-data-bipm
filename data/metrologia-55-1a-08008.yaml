    <p>This document describes the result of a key comparison for propane in nitrogen. The nominal amount-of-substance fraction of propane is 1000 Î¼mol/mol. The comparison aimed to assess the measurement capability of participants in gas analysis. Nine NMIs or DIs participated in the comparison.</p>
    <p>CERI participated in a key comparison CCQM-K111â€”propane in nitrogen, and coordinated this key comparison. Therefore, every participants' results of this comparison are linking to the CCQM-K111.</p>
    <p>Gravimetric values of the samples were used as key comparison reference values (KCRVs).</p>
    <p>Measured values of eight participants were within Â± 0.25 % of the KCRVs.</p>
    <p>Many participants reported purity or impurity analysis of materials. These results are also able to assess the participants' capability of the analysis.</p>
