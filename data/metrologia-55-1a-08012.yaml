    <p>Glucose and creatinine are two of the most frequently measured substances in human blood/serum for assessing the health status of individuals. Because of their clinical significance, CCQM-K11 glucose in human serum and CCQM-K12 creatinine in human serum were the fourth and fifth key comparisons (KCs) performed by the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG). These KCs were conducted in parallel and were completed in 2001. The initial subsequent KCs for glucose, CCQM-K11.1, and creatinine, CCQM-K12.1, were completed in 2005. Measurements for the next KCs for these two measurands, CCQM-K11.2 and CCQM-K12.2, were completed in 2013. While designed as subsequent KCs, systematic discordances between the participants' and the anchor institution's results in both comparisons lead the OAWG to request reference results from two experienced laboratories that had participated in the 2001 comparisons. Based on the totality of the available information, the OAWG converted both CCQM-K11.2 and CCQM-K12.2 to 'Track C' KCs where the key comparison reference value is estimated by consensus.</p>
    <p>These comparisons highlighted that carrying out comparisons for complex chemical measurements and expecting to be able to treat them under the approaches used for formal CIPM subsequent comparisons is not an appropriate strategy. The approach used here is a compromise to gain the best value from the comparison; it is not an approach that will be used in the future. Instead, the OAWG will focus on Track A and Track C comparisons that are treated as stand-alone entities.</p>
    <p>Participation in CCQM-K11.2 demonstrates a laboratory's capabilities to measure a polar (pKow &gt; 2), low molecular mass (100 g/mol to 500 g/mol) metabolite in human serum at relatively high concentrations (0.1 mg/g to 10 mg/g). Participation in CCQM-K12.2 demonstrates capabilities to measure similar classes of metabolites at relatively low concentrations (1 μg/g to 30 μg/g). The capabilities required for the analysis of complex biological matrices include sample preparation (protein precipitation, extraction, derivatization), gas chromatographic (GC) or liquid chromatographic (LC) separation, and quantification using an isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) approach.</p>
