    <p>The comparison required the assignment of the mass fraction of folic acid present as the main component in the comparison sample. Performance in the comparison is representative of a laboratory's measurement capability for the purity assignment of organic compounds of medium structural complexity [molecular weight range 300–500] and high polarity (<italic toggle="yes">pK</italic>OW &lt; −2).</p>
    <p>Methods used by the eighteen participating NMIs or DIs were based on a mass balance (summation of impurities) or qNMR approach, or the combination of data obtained using both methods. The qNMR results tended to give slightly lower values for the content of folic acid, albeit with larger associated uncertainties, compared with the results obtained by mass balance procedures. Possible reasons for this divergence are discussed in the report, without reaching a definitive conclusion as to their origin.</p>
    <p>The comparison demonstrates that for a structurally complex polar organic compound containing a high water content and presenting a number of additional analytical challenges, the assignment of the mass fraction content property value of the main component can reasonably be achieved with an associated relative standard uncertainty in the assigned value of 0.5%</p>
