    <p></p><p>A key comparison CCQM-K86.b was performed to demonstrate and document the capacity of National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) in the determination of the relative quantity of two specific genomic DNA fragments present in a rice powder. The study provides the support for the following measurement claim: "Quantification of the ratio of the number of copies of specified intact sequence fragments of a length up to 150 nucleotides following extraction from an unprocessed, high starch ground seed matrix, with a copy number ratio from 0.005 to 1". The study was carried out under the auspices of the Nucleic Acids Working Group (NAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM) and was jointly coordinated by the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIMC) and Government Laboratory Hong Kong (GLHK).The following laboratories (in alphabetical order) participated in this key comparison study: CENAM (Mexico); GLHK (Hong Kong); LGC (United Kingdom); NIB (Slovenia); NIMC (P.R. of China); NIMT (Thailand); NMIA (Australia); NMIJ (Japan); TÜBITAK-UME (Turkey). Good agreement was observed between the reported results.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Genetically modified (GM) crops, digital PCR, copy number ratio, GM rice</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
