    <p>The growing awareness of climate change, and continuing concerns regarding tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, will require future measurements and standards for compounds linked to these issues. To globally monitor and control the emissions of these species in the atmosphere, it is necessary to demonstrate measurement equivalence at the highest levels of accuracy for assigned values of standards. This report describes the results of a key comparison for several important monoterpene species, which are relevant to atmospheric chemistry and climate. The comparison samples include Î±-pinene, 3-carene, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>-limonene and 1,8-cineole in a nitrogen matrix gas, at a 2.5 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> amount of substance fraction. The objective of this key comparison is to evaluate the participants' capabilities to measure trace level monoterpenes using their own calibration techniques.</p>
