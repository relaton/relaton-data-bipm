    <p></p><p>The CCQM-K128 key comparison was organized by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group (IAWG) of CCQM to test the abilities of national metrology institutes in measuring the heavy metals and organo-tin in leather matrix material or other similar organics content materials, and a pilot study CCQM-P163 was conducted in parallel with this key comparison. The National Institute of Metrology (NIM), P. R. China, acted as the coordinating laboratory. This comparison includes two parts: part A is for heavy metals (eight elements include As, Cd, Pb, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Sb) in leather powder with concentrations levels (30 ~ 100) mg/kg, and part B is for organo-tin (tributyltin) in leather powder with the concentration range (150~600) nmol/g.</p><p>There were 10 laboratories registered and 9 laboratories returned the results, and different measurement methods (ID-ICPMS, ICP-MS, ICP-OES) with the microwave digestion were used in Part A; There were 3 laboratories registered and returned the results, and ID-LC-ICPMS, ID-GC-ICPMS and LC-ICPMS were used in Part B. After several rounds results and technical discussion at CCQM IAWG meeting, the KCRV and which associated uncertainty for each component had been confirmed.</p><p>The comparison is to ensure the comparable and traceable measurement results for heavy metals and organo-tin in leather products among the NMIs and other designated measurement bodies worldwide. The consequence is relatively successful overall, although some problem of mercury and antimony determination had been discussed and summarized in this report. All participants have shown their capabilities and gained experience through this comparison. The results of CCQM-K128 are expected to cover the measurement capability and support the relative CMC claiming in the leather materials and similar high organics content matrix industrial products.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Leather, metal, Organo-Tin</p><p></p><p> Main text</p><p>
