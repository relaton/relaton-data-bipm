    <p>The supplementary comparison COOMET.AUV.A-S2 for secondary calibration methods using WS1 and WS2 measurement microphones was carried out from 2014 to 2015. The results were submitted to and approved by CCAUV in September 2018.</p>
    <p>Four National Metrological Institutes which took part in this comparison are as follows: (BelGIM (Belarus), VNIIFTRI (Russia) and DP NDI "Sistema" (Ukraine)). Two of the above NMIs (VNIIFTRI and DP NDI "Sistema") had earlier participated in the COOMET key comparison and one NMI (VNIIFTRI) had also participated in CCAUV key comparison.</p>
    <p>The Comparison Reference Values were calculated as the weighted mean values from results obtained by two institutes. The comparison results showed agreement for all participants in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 10 kHz for WS1 microphones and in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz for WS2 microphones.</p>
    <p>The obtained results confirm the uncertainties of the electrostatic sensitivity measurement level for inch and half-inch working standard microphones Types WS1P and WS2P respectively.</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
