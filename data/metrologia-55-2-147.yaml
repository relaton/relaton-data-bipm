abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)
    includes formulas that produce an estimate of a scalar output quantity that is
    a function of several input quantities, and an approximate evaluation of the associated
    standard uncertainty.</p><p>This contribution presents approximate, Bayesian counterparts
    of those formulas for the case where the output quantity is a parameter of the
    joint probability distribution of the input quantities, also taking into account
    any information about the value of the output quantity available prior to measurement
    expressed in the form of a probability distribution on the set of possible values
    for the measurand.</p><p>The approximate Bayesian estimates and uncertainty evaluations
    that we present have a long history and illustrious pedigree, and provide sufficiently
    accurate approximations in many applications, yet are very easy to implement in
    practice. Differently from exact Bayesian estimates, which involve either (analytical
    or numerical) integrations, or Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, the approximations
    that we describe involve only numerical optimization and simple algebra. Therefore,
    they make Bayesian methods widely accessible to metrologists.</p><p>We illustrate
    the application of the proposed techniques in several instances of measurement:
    isotopic ratio of silver in a commercial silver nitrate; odds of cryptosporidiosis
    in AIDS patients; height of a manometer column; mass fraction of chromium in a
    reference material; and potential-difference in a Zener voltage standard.</p>'
