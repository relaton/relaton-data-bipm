abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) plays an important role in atmospheric
    chemistry and climate change. Ambient DMS is monitored in a global network and
    reported at sub-nanomole per mole (nmol/mol) levels. Developing traceable, accurate
    DMS standards at ambient levels is essential for tracking the long-term trends
    and understanding the role of DMS in the atmosphere. Gravimetrically prepared
    gas standards in cylinders are widely used for calibrating instruments. Therefore,
    a stable primary standard gas mixture (PSM) is required for traceable ambient
    DMS measurement at remote sites. In this study, to evaluate adsorption loss on
    the internal surface of the gas cylinder, 6 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> DMS gas mixtures
    were prepared in three types of aluminium cylinders: a cylinder without a special
    coating on its internal surface (AL), an Aculife IV  +  III-treated cylinder (AC),
    and an Experis-treated cylinder (EX). There was little adsorption loss on the
    EX cylinder, whereas there was substantial adsorption loss on the other two cylinders.
    The EX cylinder was used to prepare 0.5, 2, 5, and 7 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> DMS
    PSMs with relative expanded uncertainties of less than 0.4%. The DMS PSMs were
    analytically verified and consistent within a relative expanded uncertainty of
    less than 1.2%. The long-term stability of the 7 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> DMS PSM
    was assessed by tracking the ratio of the DMS to the internal standard, benzene.
    The results showed that the DMS was stable for about seven months and it was projected
    to be stable for more than 60 months within a relative expanded uncertainty of
    3%.</p>'
