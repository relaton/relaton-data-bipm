abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Quantum Hall array resistance standards (QHARSs) are integrated
    circuits composed of interconnected quantum Hall effect elements that allow the
    realization of virtually arbitrary resistance values. In recent years, techniques
    were presented to efficiently design QHARS networks. An open problem is that of
    the evaluation of the accuracy of a QHARS, which is affected by contact and wire
    resistances. In this work, we present a general and systematic procedure for the
    error modelling of QHARSs, which is based on modern circuit analysis techniques
    and Monte Carlo evaluation of the uncertainty. As a practical example, this method
    of analysis is applied to the characterization of a 1 MÎ© QHARS developed by the
    National Metrology Institute of Japan. Software tools are provided to apply the
    procedure to other arrays.</p>
