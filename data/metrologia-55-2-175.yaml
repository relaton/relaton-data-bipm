abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Time transfer using global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
    is a primary method of remote atomic clock comparisons. As of today, there are
    four operational GNSS systems, namely GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou Navigation
    Satellite System (BDS or BeiDou). All of them can continuously provide position,
    navigation and time services. This paper mainly focuses on the progress of BeiDou
    time transfer at the National Time Service Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    (NTSC). In order to realize the BeiDou common view (CV) time comparison, we developed
    the Rinex2CGGTTS software according to the guidelines of the Common GNSS Generic
    Time Transfer Standard, Version 2E (CGGTTS V2E). By comparing the solutions of
    the Rinex2CGGTTS software to the solutions of the sbf2cggtts software provided
    by the manufacturer of our multi-GNSS receiver, we found the sbf2cggtts (version
    1.0.5) solutions contained biases in measurements to different BeiDou satellites.
    The biases are most likely caused by sbf2cggttsâ€™ timing group delay corrections
    in data processing. The noise of the observation data is analyzed by code multipath
    and common clock difference. Finally, the BeiDou CV results are compared to the
    GPS/GLONASS/Galileo CV results between NTSC and three European UTC(k) laboratories,
    including Royal Observatory of Belgium (ORB), Real Institute y Observatory de
    la Armada (ROA), Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE or SP). For the comparisons
    of each baseline, we aligned the BeiDou/Galileo/GLONASS links to the calibrated
    GPS link with the double-difference method. The results show that the performance
    of BeiDou CV is correlated to the number of BeiDou satellites available in common
    view. With the current BeiDou constellation, the standard deviation of the differences
    between all BeiDou CV satellites averaging result and the GPS PPP result is 2.03
    ns, 2.90 ns and 4.06 ns for ORB-NTSC, SP-NTSC and ROA-NTSC links respectively.</p>
