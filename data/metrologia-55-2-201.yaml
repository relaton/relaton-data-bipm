    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The GROVEX (GROssVolumige EXtrapolationskammer, large-volume extrapolation chamber) is the primary standard for the dosimetry of low-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). In the course of setup modifications and re-measuring of several dimensions, the correction factors have been re-evaluated in this work. The correction factors for scatter and attenuation have been recalculated using the Monte Carlo software package EGSnrc, and a new expression has been found for the divergence correction. The obtained results decrease the measured reference air kerma rate by approximately 0.9% for the representative example of a seed of type Bebig I25.S16C. This lies within the expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>  =  2).</p>
