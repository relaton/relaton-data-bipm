abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The GROVEX (GROssVolumige EXtrapolationskammer, large-volume
    extrapolation chamber) is the primary standard for the dosimetry of low-dose-rate
    interstitial brachytherapy at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB).
    In the course of setup modifications and re-measuring of several dimensions, the
    correction factors have been re-evaluated in this work. The correction factors
    for scatter and attenuation have been recalculated using the Monte Carlo software
    package EGSnrc, and a new expression has been found for the divergence correction.
    The obtained results decrease the measured reference air kerma rate by approximately
    0.9% for the representative example of a seed of type Bebig I25.S16C. This lies
    within the expanded uncertainty (k  =  2).</p>
