abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For the first time, an international comparison was conducted
    on the determination of the purity of a high purity element. Participants were
    free to choose any analytical approach appropriate for their institute’s applications
    and services. The material tested was a high purity zinc, which had earlier been
    assessed for homogeneity and previously used in CCQM-K72 for the determination
    of six defined metallic impurities. Either a direct metal assay of the Zn mass
    fraction was undertaken by EDTA titrimetry, or an indirect approach was used wherein
    all impurities, or at least the major ones, were determined and their sum subtracted
    from ideal purity of 100%, or 1 kg kg<sup>−1</sup>. Impurity assessment techniques
    included glow discharge mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
    and carrier gas hot extraction/combustion analysis. Up to 91 elemental impurities
    covering metals, non-metals and semi-metals/metalloids were quantified. Due to
    the lack of internal experience or experimental capabilities, some participants
    contracted external laboratories for specific analytical tasks, mainly for the
    analysis of non-metals. The reported purity, expressed as zinc mass fraction in
    the high purity zinc material, showed excellent agreement for all participants,
    with a relative standard deviation of 0.011%. The calculated reference value,
    w(Zn)  =  0.999 873 kg kg<sup>−1</sup>, was assigned an asymmetric combined uncertainty
    of  +0.000 025 kg kg<sup>−1</sup> and  −0.000 028 kg kg<sup>−1</sup>. Comparability
    amongst participating metrology institutes is thus demonstrated for the purity
    determination of high purity metals which have no particular difficulties with
    their decomposition/dissolution process when solution-based analytical methods
    are used, or which do not have specific difficulties when direct analysis approaches
    are used. Nevertheless, further development is required in terms of uncertainty
    assessment, quantification of non-metals and the determination of purity of less
    pure elements and/or for those elements suffering difficulties with the decomposition
    process.</p>
