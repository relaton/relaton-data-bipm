abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A fractional error as large as 25 pm mmâˆ’1 at the zero optical-path
    difference has been observed in an optical interferometer measuring the displacement
    of an x-ray interferometer used to determine the lattice parameter of silicon.
    Detailed investigations have brought to light that the error was caused by light
    forward-scattered from the beam feeding the interferometer. This paper reports
    on the impact of forward-scattered light on the accuracy of two-beam optical interferometry
    applied to length metrology, and supplies a model capable of explaining the observed
    error.</p>
