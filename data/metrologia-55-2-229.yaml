abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In both meteorological and metrological applications, it is
    well known that air temperature sensors are susceptible to radiative errors. However,
    it is not widely known that the radiative error measured by an air temperature
    sensor in flowing air depends upon the sensor diameter, with smaller sensors reporting
    values closer to true air temperature. This is not a transient effect related
    to sensor heat capacity, but a fluid-dynamical effect arising from heat and mass
    flow in cylindrical geometries. This result has been known historically and is
    in meteorology text books. However, its significance does not appear to be widely
    appreciated and, as a consequence, air temperature can be—and probably is being—widely
    mis-estimated.</p><p>In this paper, we first review prior descriptions of the
    ‘sensor size’ effect from the metrological and meteorological literature. We develop
    a heat transfer model to describe the process for cylindrical sensors, and evaluate
    the predicted temperature error for a range of sensor sizes and air speeds. We
    compare these predictions with published predictions and measurements. We report
    measurements demonstrating this effect in two laboratories at NPL in which the
    air flow and temperature are exceptionally closely controlled. The results are
    consistent with the heat-transfer model, and show that the air temperature error
    is proportional to the square root of the sensor diameter and that, even under
    good laboratory conditions, it can exceed 0.1 °C for a 6 mm diameter sensor.</p><p>We
    then consider the implications of this result. In metrological applications, errors
    of the order of 0.1 °C are significant, representing limiting uncertainties in
    dimensional and mass measurements. In meteorological applications, radiative errors
    can easily be much larger. But in both cases, an understanding of the diameter
    dependence allows assessment and correction of the radiative error using a multi-sensor
    technique.</p>
