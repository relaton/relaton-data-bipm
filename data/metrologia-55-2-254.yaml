abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Size and shape distributions of gold nanorod samples are critical
    to their physico-chemical properties, especially their longitudinal surface plasmon
    resonance. This interlaboratory comparison study developed methods for measuring
    and evaluating size and shape distributions for gold nanorod samples using transmission
    electron microscopy (TEM) images. The objective was to determine whether two different
    samples, which had different performance attributes in their application, were
    different with respect to their size and/or shape descriptor distributions. Touching
    particles in the captured images were identified using a ruggedness shape descriptor.
    Nanorods could be distinguished from nanocubes using an elongational shape descriptor.
    A non-parametric statistical test showed that cumulative distributions of an elongational
    shape descriptor, that is, the aspect ratio, were statistically different between
    the two samples for all laboratories. While the scale parameters of size and shape
    distributions were similar for both samples, the width parameters of size and
    shape distributions were statistically different. This protocol fulfills an important
    need for a standardized approach to measure gold nanorod size and shape distributions
    for applications in which quantitative measurements and comparisons are important.
    Furthermore, the validated protocol workflow can be automated, thus providing
    consistent and rapid measurements of nanorod size and shape distributions for
    researchers, regulatory agencies, and industry.</p>
