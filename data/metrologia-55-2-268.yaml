abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the results of high-voltage collinear laser spectroscopy
    measurements on the 5 ppm relative uncertainty level using a pump and probe scheme
    at the 4s2S1/2→4p2P3/2 transition of 40Ca+ involving the 3d2D5/2 metastable state.
    With two-stage laser interaction and a reference measurement we can eliminate
    systematic effects such as differences in the contact potentials due to different
    electrode materials and thermoelectric voltages, and the unknown starting potential
    of the ions in the ion source. Voltage measurements were performed between  −5 kV
    and  −19 kV and parallel measurements with stable high-voltage dividers calibrated
    to 5 ppm relative uncertainty were used as a reference. Our measurements are compatible
    with the uncertainty limits of the high-voltage dividers and demonstrate an unprecedented
    (factor of 20) increase in the precision of direct laser-based high-voltage measurements.</p>
