abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This contribution presents a reference setup to measure the
    power of the cell-specific resource elements present in downlink long term evolution
    (LTE) signals in a way that the measurements are traceable to the international
    system of units. This setup can be used to calibrate the LTE code-selective field
    probes that are used to measure the radiation of base stations for mobile telephony.
    It can also be used to calibrate LTE signal generators and receivers. The method
    is based on traceable scope measurements performed directly at the output of a
    measuring antenna. It implements offline digital signal processing demodulation
    algorithms that consider the digital down-conversion, timing synchronization,
    frequency synchronization, phase synchronization and robust LTE cell identification
    to produce the downlink time-frequency LTE grid. Experimental results on conducted
    test scenarios, both single-input–single-output and multiple-input–multiple-output
    antenna configuration, show promising results confirming measurement uncertainties
    of the order of 0.05 dB with a coverage factor of 2.</p>
