abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>BIPM’s new transportable programmable Josephson voltage standard
    (PJVS) has been used for an on-site comparison at the National Metrology Institute
    of Japan (NMIJ) and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and
    Technology (AIST) (NMIJ/AIST, hereafter called just NMIJ unless otherwise noted).</p><p>This
    is the first time that an array of niobium-based Josephson junctions with amorphous
    niobium silicon Nb<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>1−x</sub> barriers, developed by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has been directly compared to an
    array of niobium nitride (NbN)-based junctions (developed by the NMIJ in collaboration
    with the Nanoelectronics Research Institute (NeRI), AIST).</p><p>Nominally identical
    voltages produced by both systems agreed within 5 parts in 10<sup>12</sup> (0.05
    nV at 10 V) with a combined relative uncertainty of 7.9  ×  10<sup>−11</sup> (0.79
    nV).</p><p>The low side of the NMIJ apparatus is, by design, referred to the ground
    potential. An analysis of the systematic errors due to the leakage current to
    ground was conducted for this ground configuration. The influence of a multi-stage
    low-pass filter installed at the output measurement leads of the NMIJ primary
    standard was also investigated. The number of capacitances in parallel in the
    filter and their insulation resistance have a direct impact on the amplitude of
    the systematic voltage error introduced by the leakage current, even if the current
    does not necessarily return to ground. The filtering of the output of the PJVS
    voltage leads has the positive consequence of protecting the array from external
    sources of noise. Current noise, when coupled to the array, reduces the width
    or current range of the quantized voltage steps.</p><p>The voltage error induced
    by the leakage current in the filter is an order of magnitude larger than the
    voltage error in the absence of all filtering, even though the current range of
    steps is significantly decreased without filtering.</p>
