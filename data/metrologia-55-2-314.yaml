    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the paper by Ashby (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10) the correction due to the time delay of light propagated through the prism retroreflector of absolute gravimeters is discussed. Accordingly, the correction of about  −6.8 µGal should be applied for a typical gravimeter such as the most precise FG5(X) gravimeter declaring standard uncertainty at the level of 2 µGal. In consequence, the present gravimetric results related to the Kibble balance or the global absolute gravity reference system should be significantly changed. However, such a change needs a deeper scientific consensus. In our comment, we would like to show that the proposed correction should not be applied since the author’s consideration is incorrect.</p>
