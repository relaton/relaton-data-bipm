abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Proper characterization of test setups used in industry for
    testing and traceable measurement of lighting devices by the substitution method
    is an important task. According to new standards for testing LED lamps, luminaires
    and modules, uncertainty budgets are requested because in many cases the properties
    of the device under test differ from the transfer standard used, which may cause
    significant errors, for example if a LED-based lamp is tested or calibrated in
    an integrating sphere which was calibrated with a tungsten lamp. This paper introduces
    a multiple transfer standard, which was designed not only to transfer a single
    calibration value (e.g. luminous flux) but also to characterize test setups used
    for LED measurements with additional provided and calibrated output features to
    enable the application of the new standards.</p>
