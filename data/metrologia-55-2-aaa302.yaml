abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A list of standard reference frequency values (LoF) of quantum
    transitions from the microwave to the optical regime has been recommended by the
    International Committee for Weights and Measures (Comit√© international des poids
    et mesures, CIPM) for use in basic research, technology, and for the metrology
    of time, frequency and length. The CIPM LoF contains entries that are recommended
    as secondary representations of the second in the International System of Units,
    and entries that can be used to serve as realizations of the definition of the
    metre. The historical perspective that led to the CIPM LoF is outlined. Procedures
    have been developed for updating existing, and validating new, entries into the
    CIPM LoF. The CIPM LoF might serve as an entry for a future redefinition of the
    second by an optical transition.</p>
