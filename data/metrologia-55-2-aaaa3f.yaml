abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The determination of electrolytes in human body fluids is one
    of the most frequently performed analyses in clinical routine laboratories. Metrological
    traceability of measurement results in patient samples is essential and requires
    the involvement of higher order reference measurement procedures wherever available.
    Here, the authors present the evaluation of a higher order reference system for
    the simultaneous determination of K<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>,
    Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> in blood serum and plasma. In the same order,
    the determined measurement performances were as follows: measurement ranges: 0.75
    mmol l<sup>−1</sup>–75.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>, 0.05 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>–5.00 mmol
    l<sup>−1</sup>, 5 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>–200 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>, 0.4 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>–8.0
    mmol l<sup>−1</sup> and 0.1 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>–4.0 mmol l<sup>−1</sup>. Measurement
    imprecision: CVs were  ⩽1.1% for intra assay investigations and  ⩽1.8% for long
    term inter assay investigations for all measurands. Excellent accuracy was found
    testing certified Standard Reference Materials from NIST: SRM 909 (deviations
    from 0.0% to 1.1%) and SRM 956 (deviations from 0.0% to 1.5%). Intercomparisons
    with the German Metrology Institute (PTB) revealed differences from 0.1% to 0.8%.
    Matrix influences and carry over were not detectable. The expanded combined measurement
    uncertainties for the determination of the reference method values were estimated
    as  ⩾1.5% ( k   =  2) for each measurand. The reference measurement procedure
    is accredited by the German accreditation body (DAkkS) in association with the
    German calibration service (DKD) according to ISO 17025 and ISO 15195. Services
    comprise the certification of calibrators, control materials and samples used
    in proficiency testing schemes.</p>'
