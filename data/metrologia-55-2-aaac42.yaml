abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The comment (Křen and Pálinkás 2017 Metrologia 55 314–5) claims
    that the paper Relativistic theory of the falling cube gravimeter (Ashby 2017
    Metrologia 55 1–10) is incorrect. The authors of this comment assert that optical
    paths in the two interferometer arms of an absolute gravimeter shift only the
    absolute phase difference between interferometer arms and therefore cannot affect
    the measured value of g, and that the only needed relativistic correction is the
    commonly applied ‘speed of light correction’. Neither claim stands up to scrutiny.</p>
