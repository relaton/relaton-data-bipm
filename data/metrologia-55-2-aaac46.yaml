abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the paper by Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10) the correction
    due to the time delay of light propagated through the prism retroreflector of
    absolute gravimeters is discussed. Accordingly, the correction of about  −6.8
    µGal should be applied for a typical gravimeter such as the most precise FG5(X)
    gravimeter declaring standard uncertainty at the level of 2 µGal. In consequence,
    the present gravimetric results related to the Kibble balance or the global absolute
    gravity reference system should be significantly changed. However, such a change
    needs a deeper scientific consensus. In our comment, we would like to show that
    the proposed correction should not be applied since the author’s consideration
    is incorrect.</p>
