abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe our progress in developing the infrastructure for
    traceable transient measurements of pressure. Towards that end, we have built
    and characterized a dual diaphragm shock tube that allows us to achieve shock
    amplitude reproducibility of approximately 2.3% for shocks with Mach speeds ranging
    from 1.26â€“1.5. In this proof-of-concept study we use our shock tube to characterize
    the dynamic response of photonic sensors embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS),
    a material of choice for soft tissue phantoms. Our results indicate that the PDMS-embedded
    photonic sensors response to shock evolves over a tens to hundreds of microseconds
    time scale making it a useful system for studying transient pressures in soft
    tissue.</p>
