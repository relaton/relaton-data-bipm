abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM),
    at its meeting in October 2017, followed the recommendation of the Consultative
    Committee for Units (CCU) on the redefinition of the kilogram, ampere, kelvin
    and mole. For the redefinition of the kelvin, the Boltzmann constant will be fixed
    with the numerical value 1.380 649  ×  10<sup>−23</sup> J K<sup>−1</sup>. The
    relative standard uncertainty to be transferred to the thermodynamic temperature
    value of the triple point of water will be 3.7  ×  10<sup>−7</sup>, corresponding
    to an uncertainty in temperature of 0.10 mK, sufficiently low for all practical
    purposes. With the redefinition of the kelvin, the broad research activities of
    the temperature community on the determination of the Boltzmann constant have
    been very successfully completed. In the following, a review of the determinations
    of the Boltzmann constant k, important for the new definition of the kelvin and
    performed in the last decade, is given.</p>
