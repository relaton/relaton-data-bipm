    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Proper characterization of test setups used in industry for testing and traceable measurement of lighting devices by the substitution method is an important task. According to new standards for testing LED lamps, luminaires and modules, uncertainty budgets are requested because in many cases the properties of the device under test differ from the transfer standard used, which may cause significant errors, for example if a LED-based lamp is tested or calibrated in an integrating sphere which was calibrated with a tungsten lamp. This paper introduces a multiple transfer standard, which was designed not only to transfer a single calibration value (e.g. luminous flux) but also to characterize test setups used for LED measurements with additional provided and calibrated output features to enable the application of the new standards.</p>
