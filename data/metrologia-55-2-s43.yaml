abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Large-area high-temperature fixed-point (HTFP) blackbodies with
    working temperatures of approximately 2748 K and 3021 K, based on an Re–C eutectic
    and a WC–C peritectic respectively, have been developed and investigated. The
    blackbodies have an emissivity of 0.9997, show high-quality phase-transition plateaus
    and have high repeatability of the melting temperatures, but demonstrate temperature
    differences (from 0.2 K to 0.6 K) compared with small-cell blackbodies of the
    same HTFP. We associate these temperature differences with the temperature drop
    effect, which may differ from cell to cell. The large radiating cavity diameter
    of 14 mm allows developed HTFP blackbodies to be used for photometric and radiometric
    applications in irradiance mode with uncertainties as small as 0.12% (k  =  1)
    in the visible. A photometer and an irradiance-mode filter radiometer (visible
    range), previously calibrated at VNIIOFI, were used to measure illuminance and
    irradiance of the HTFP blackbodies equipped with a precise outer aperture. The
    values measured by the detectors agreed with those based on the blackbody calculation
    to within 0.2%. The large-area HTFP blackbodies will be used in a joint PTB–VNIIOFI
    experiment on measuring thermodynamic temperature.</p>
