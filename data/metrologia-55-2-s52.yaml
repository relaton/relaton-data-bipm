abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we present the development of a primary standard
    for dynamic pressures that is based on the drop weight method. At the moment dynamic
    pressure transducers are typically calibrated using reference transducers, which
    are calibrated against static pressure standards. Because dynamic and static characteristics
    of pressure transducers may significantly differ from each other, it is important
    that these transducers are calibrated against dynamic pressure standards. In a
    method developed in VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, Centre for Metrology
    MIKES, a pressure pulse is generated by impact between a dropping weight and a
    piston of a liquid-filled piston-cylinder assembly. The traceability to SI-units
    is realized through interferometric measurement of the acceleration of the dropping
    weight during impact, the effective area of the piston-cylinder assembly and the
    mass of the weight. Based on experimental validation and an uncertainty evaluation,
    the developed primary standard provides traceability for peak pressures in the
    range from 10 MPa to 400 MPa with a few millisecond pulse width and a typical
    relative expanded uncertainty (k  =  2) of 1.5%. The performance of the primary
    standard is demonstrated by test calibrations of two dynamic pressure transducers.</p>
