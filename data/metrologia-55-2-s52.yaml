    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this paper we present the development of a primary standard for dynamic pressures that is based on the drop weight method. At the moment dynamic pressure transducers are typically calibrated using reference transducers, which are calibrated against static pressure standards. Because dynamic and static characteristics of pressure transducers may significantly differ from each other, it is important that these transducers are calibrated against dynamic pressure standards. In a method developed in VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, Centre for Metrology MIKES, a pressure pulse is generated by impact between a dropping weight and a piston of a liquid-filled piston-cylinder assembly. The traceability to SI-units is realized through interferometric measurement of the acceleration of the dropping weight during impact, the effective area of the piston-cylinder assembly and the mass of the weight. Based on experimental validation and an uncertainty evaluation, the developed primary standard provides traceability for peak pressures in the range from 10 MPa to 400 MPa with a few millisecond pulse width and a typical relative expanded uncertainty (<italic>k</italic>  =  2) of 1.5%. The performance of the primary standard is demonstrated by test calibrations of two dynamic pressure transducers.</p>
