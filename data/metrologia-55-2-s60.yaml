abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The evaluation of measurement uncertainty in accordance with
    the ‘Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement’ (GUM) has not yet
    become widespread in physical chemistry. With only the law of the propagation
    of uncertainty from the GUM, many of these uncertainty evaluations would be cumbersome,
    as models are often non-linear and require iterative calculations. The methods
    from GUM supplements 1 and 2 enable the propagation of uncertainties under most
    circumstances. Experimental data in physical chemistry are used, for example,
    to derive reference property data and support trade—all applications where measurement
    uncertainty plays an important role. This paper aims to outline how the methods
    for evaluating and propagating uncertainty can be applied to some specific cases
    with a wide impact: deriving reference data from vapour pressure data, a flash
    calculation, and the use of an equation-of-state to predict the properties of
    both phases in a vapour–liquid equilibrium. The three uncertainty evaluations
    demonstrate that the methods of GUM and its supplements are a versatile toolbox
    that enable us to evaluate the measurement uncertainty of physical chemical measurements,
    including the derivation of reference data, such as the equilibrium thermodynamical
    properties of fluids.</p>'
