abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For a dynamic calibration, a torque transducer is described
    by a mechanical model, and the corresponding model parameters are to be identified
    from measurement data. A measuring device for the primary calibration of dynamic
    torque, and a corresponding model-based calibration approach, have recently been
    developed at PTB. The complete mechanical model of the calibration set-up is very
    complex, and involves several calibration steps—making a straightforward implementation
    of a Monte Carlo uncertainty evaluation tedious. With this in mind, we here propose
    to separate the complete model into sub-models, with each sub-model being treated
    with individual experiments and analysis. The uncertainty evaluation for the overall
    model then has to combine the information from the sub-models in line with Supplement
    2 of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. In this contribution,
    we demonstrate how to carry this out using the Monte Carlo method. The uncertainty
    evaluation involves various input quantities of different origin and the solution
    of a numerical optimisation problem.</p>
