abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have developed spectral models describing the electroluminescence
    spectra of AlGaInP and InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) consisting of the Maxwell–Boltzmann
    distribution and the effective joint density of states. One spectrum at a known
    temperature for one LED specimen is needed for calibrating the model parameters
    of each LED type. Then, the model can be used for determining the junction temperature
    optically from the spectral measurement, because the junction temperature is one
    of the free parameters. We validated the models using, in total, 53 spectra of
    three red AlGaInP LED specimens and 72 spectra of three blue InGaN LED specimens
    measured at various current levels and temperatures between 303 K and 398 K. For
    all the spectra of red LEDs, the standard deviation between the modelled and measured
    junction temperatures was only 2.4 K. InGaN LEDs have a more complex effective
    joint density of states. For the blue LEDs, the corresponding standard deviation
    was 11.2 K, but it decreased to 3.5 K when each LED specimen was calibrated separately.
    The method of determining junction temperature was further tested on white InGaN
    LEDs with luminophore coating and LED lamps. The average standard deviation was
    8 K for white InGaN LED types. We have six years of ageing data available for
    a set of LED lamps and we estimated the junction temperatures of these lamps with
    respect to their ageing times. It was found that the LEDs operating at higher
    junction temperatures were frequently more damaged.</p>
