abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The UME Kibble balance project was initiated in the second half
    of 2014. During this period we have studied the theoretical aspects of Kibble
    balances, in which an oscillating magnet generates AC Faraday’s voltage in a stationary
    coil, and constructed a trial version to implement this idea. The remarkable feature
    of this approach is that it can establish the link between the Planck constant
    and a macroscopic mass by one single experiment in the most natural way. Weak
    dependences on variations of environmental and experimental conditions, small
    size, and other useful features offered by this novel approach reduce the complexity
    of the experimental set-up. This paper describes the principles of the oscillating
    magnet Kibble balance and gives details of the preliminary Planck constant measurements.
    The value of the Planck constant determined with our apparatus is h/h90=1.000004 ,
    with a relative standard uncertainty of 6 ppm.</p>
