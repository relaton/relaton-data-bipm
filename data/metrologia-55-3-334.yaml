abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this work, the liquidus temperature of tin was determined
    by melting the sample using the pressure-controlled loop heat pipe. Square wave-type
    pressure steps generated periodic 0.7 Â°C temperature steps in the isothermal region
    in the vicinity of the tin sample, and the tin was melted with controllable heat
    pulses from the generated temperature changes. The melting temperatures at specific
    melted fractions were measured, and they were extrapolated to the melted fraction
    of unity to determine the liquidus temperature of tin. To investigate the influence
    of the impurity distribution on the melting behavior, a molten tin sample was
    solidified by an outward slow freezing or by quenching to segregate the impurities
    inside the sample with concentrations increasing outwards or to spread the impurities
    uniformly, respectively. The measured melting temperatures followed the local
    solidus temperature variations well in the case of the segregated sample and stayed
    near the solidus temperature in the quenched sample due to the microscopic melting
    behavior. The extrapolated melting temperatures of the segregated and quenched
    samples were 0.95 mK and 0.49 mK higher than the outside-nucleated freezing temperature
    of tin (with uncertainties of 0.15 mK and 0.16 mK, at approximately 95% level
    of confidence), respectively. The extrapolated melting temperature of the segregated
    sample was supposed to be a closer approximation to the liquidus temperature of
    tin, whereas the quenched sample yielded the possibility of a misleading extrapolation
    to the solidus temperature. Therefore, the determination of the liquidus temperature
    could result in different extrapolated melting temperatures depending on the way
    the impurities were distributed within the sample, which has implications for
    the contemporary methodology for realizing temperature fixed points of the International
    Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).</p>
