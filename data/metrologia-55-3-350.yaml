abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The abnormal frequencies of an atomic clock mainly include frequency
    jump and frequency drift jump. Atomic clock frequency anomaly detection is a key
    technique in time-keeping. The Kalman filter algorithm, as a linear optimal algorithm,
    has been widely used in real-time detection for abnormal frequency. In order to
    obtain an optimal state estimation, the observation model and dynamic model of
    the Kalman filter algorithm should satisfy Gaussian white noise conditions. The
    detection performance is degraded if anomalies affect the observation model or
    dynamic model. The idea of the adaptive Kalman filter algorithm, applied to clock
    frequency anomaly detection, uses the residuals given by the prediction for building
    ‘an adaptive factor’; the prediction state covariance matrix is real-time corrected
    by the adaptive factor. The results show that the model error is reduced and the
    detection performance is improved. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified
    by the frequency jump simulation, the frequency drift jump simulation and the
    measured data of the atomic clock by using the chi-square test.</p>
