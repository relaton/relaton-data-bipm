abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A mobile atomic absolute gravimeter NIM-AGRb-1 based on light-pulse
    atom interferometer has been built, evaluated by the National Institute of Metrology
    (NIM) China, and participated in the pilot study of the International Comparison
    of Absolute Gravimeters (CCM.G-K2.2017) held at NIM Changping Beijing in October
    2017. The sensitivity of the gravimeter is 44 µGal Hz<sup>−1/2</sup> (1 µGal  =  10<sup>−8</sup>
    m s<sup>−2</sup>  ≈  10<sup>−9</sup> g) and its instability reaches as small as
    0.2 µGal when averaged over 30 000 s. The instrumental and environmental effects
    were evaluated and corrected with a total uncertainty of 5.2 µGal. The absolute
    g measured by NIM-AGRb-1 was compared to that of a commercial FG5X-249 optical
    gravimeter with the two devices operating side by side in the same laboratory
    and their results agree within  −0.2(6.3) µGal. NIM-AGRb-1 also demonstrated continuous
    operation over a period of more than 500 h.</p>
