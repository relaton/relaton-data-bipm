abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the uncertainty evaluation of the Swiss continuous
    primary frequency standard FoCS-2 (Fontaine Continue Suisse). Unlike other primary
    frequency standards which are working with clouds of cold atoms, this fountain
    uses a continuous beam of cold caesium atoms bringing a series of metrological
    advantages and specific techniques for the evaluation of the uncertainty budget.
    Recent improvements of FoCS-2 have made possible the evaluation of the frequency
    shifts and of their uncertainties in the order of. When operating in an optimal
    regime a relative frequency instability of is obtained. The relative standard
    uncertainty reported in this article,, is strongly dominated by the statistics
    of the frequency measurements.</p>
