abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The radiant intensity of synchrotron radiation can be accurately
    calculated with classical electrodynamics. This primary realization of the spectral
    radiant intensity has been used by PTB at several electron storage rings which
    have been optimized to be operated as primary source standards for the calibration
    of transfer sources in the spectral range of UV and VUV for almost 30 years. The
    transfer sources are compared to the primary source standard by means of suitable
    wavelength-dispersive transfer stations.</p><p>The spectral range covered by deuterium
    lamps, which represent transfer sources that are easy to handle, is of particular
    relevance in practice. Here, we report on developments in the realization and
    preservation of the radiometric scales for spectral radiant intensity and spectral
    radiance in the wavelength region from 116 nm to 400 nm, based on a set of deuterium
    reference lamps, over the last few decades. An inside view and recommendations
    on the operation of the D2 lamps used for the realization of the radiometric scale
    are presented. The data has been recently compiled to illustrate the chronological
    behaviour at various wavelengths. Moreover, an overview of the internal and external
    validation measurements and intercomparisons is given.</p>
