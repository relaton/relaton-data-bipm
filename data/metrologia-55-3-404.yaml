abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A Bayesian statistical procedure is proposed for value assignment
    and uncertainty evaluation for the mass fraction of the elemental analytes in
    single-element solutions distributed as NIST standard reference materials. The
    principal novelty that we describe is the use of information about relative differences
    observed historically between the measured values obtained via gravimetry and
    via high-performance inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry,
    to quantify the uncertainty component attributable to between-method differences.
    This information is encapsulated in a prior probability distribution for the between-method
    uncertainty component, and it is then used, together with the information provided
    by current measurement data, to produce a probability distribution for the value
    of the measurand from which an estimate and evaluation of uncertainty are extracted
    using established statistical procedures.</p>
