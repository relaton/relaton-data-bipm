abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Sensitivity analysis associated with the evaluation of measurement
    uncertainty is a very important tool for the metrologist, enabling them to provide
    an uncertainty budget and to gain a better understanding of the measurand and
    the underlying measurement process. Using the GUM uncertainty framework, the contribution
    of an input quantity to the variance of the output quantity is obtained through
    so-called ‘sensitivity coefficients’. In contrast, such coefficients are no longer
    computed in cases where a Monte-Carlo method is used. In such a case, supplement
    1 to the GUM suggests varying the input quantities one at a time, which is not
    an efficient method and may provide incorrect contributions to the variance in
    cases where significant interactions arise. This paper proposes different methods
    for the elaboration of the uncertainty budget associated with a Monte Carlo method.
    An application to the mass calibration example described in supplement 1 to the
    GUM is performed with the corresponding R code for implementation. Finally, guidance
    is given for choosing a method, including suggestions for a future revision of
    supplement 1 to the GUM.</p>
