abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A primary-standard flowing-water optical power meter for measuring
    multi-kilowatt laser emission has been built and operated. The design and operational
    details of this primary standard are described, and a full uncertainty analysis
    is provided covering the measurement range from 1â€“10 kW with an expanded uncertainty
    of 1.2%. Validating measurements at 5 kW and 10 kW show agreement with other measurement
    techniques to within the measurement uncertainty.</p>
