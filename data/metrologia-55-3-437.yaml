    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The uncertainty propagation problem is quite important for temperature measurements, since we rely so much on the sensors and calibration equations. Although uncertainty propagation for platinum resistance or radiation thermometers is well known, there have been few publications concerning negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors. Insight into the propagation characteristics of uncertainty that develop when equations are determined using the Lagrange interpolation or least-squares fitting method is presented here with respect to several of the most common equations used in NTC thermistor calibration. Within this work, analytical expressions of the propagated uncertainties for both fitting methods are derived for the uncertainties in the measured temperature and resistance at each calibration point. High-precision calibration of an NTC thermistor in a precision water bath was performed by means of the comparison method. Results show that, for both fitting methods, the propagated uncertainty is flat in the interpolation region but rises rapidly beyond the calibration range. Also, for temperatures interpolated between calibration points, the propagated uncertainty is generally no greater than that associated with the calibration points. For least-squares fitting, the propagated uncertainty is significantly reduced by increasing the number of calibration points and can be well kept below the uncertainty of the calibration points.</p>
