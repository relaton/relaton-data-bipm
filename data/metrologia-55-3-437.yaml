abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The uncertainty propagation problem is quite important for temperature
    measurements, since we rely so much on the sensors and calibration equations.
    Although uncertainty propagation for platinum resistance or radiation thermometers
    is well known, there have been few publications concerning negative temperature
    coefficient (NTC) thermistors. Insight into the propagation characteristics of
    uncertainty that develop when equations are determined using the Lagrange interpolation
    or least-squares fitting method is presented here with respect to several of the
    most common equations used in NTC thermistor calibration. Within this work, analytical
    expressions of the propagated uncertainties for both fitting methods are derived
    for the uncertainties in the measured temperature and resistance at each calibration
    point. High-precision calibration of an NTC thermistor in a precision water bath
    was performed by means of the comparison method. Results show that, for both fitting
    methods, the propagated uncertainty is flat in the interpolation region but rises
    rapidly beyond the calibration range. Also, for temperatures interpolated between
    calibration points, the propagated uncertainty is generally no greater than that
    associated with the calibration points. For least-squares fitting, the propagated
    uncertainty is significantly reduced by increasing the number of calibration points
    and can be well kept below the uncertainty of the calibration points.</p>
