    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Although the equation of motion developed in the paper (Ashby 2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1) depends on the parameters of the falling cube, such as the depth and refraction index, the parameters are only associated with powers of time no greater than one, and so do not affect the acceleration. The paper’s correction due to light propagation within the cube is therefore not supported by the equation of motion, and was probably caused by omissions in the data analysis. The ‘speed of light’ component of the acceleration that follows from the equation agrees with the results obtained by other authors.</p>
