abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Although the equation of motion developed in the paper (Ashby
    2018 Metrologia 55 1) depends on the parameters of the falling cube, such as the
    depth and refraction index, the parameters are only associated with powers of
    time no greater than one, and so do not affect the acceleration. The paper’s correction
    due to light propagation within the cube is therefore not supported by the equation
    of motion, and was probably caused by omissions in the data analysis. The ‘speed
    of light’ component of the acceleration that follows from the equation agrees
    with the results obtained by other authors.</p>
