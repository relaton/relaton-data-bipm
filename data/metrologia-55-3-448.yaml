    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The comment (Nagornyi 2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic>) claims that, notwithstanding the conclusions stated in the paper <italic>Relativistic theory of the falling cube gravimeter</italic> (Ashby 2008 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10), there is no need to consider the dimensions or refractive index of the cube in fitting data from falling cube absolute gravimeters; additional questions are raised about matching quartic polynomials while determining only three quantities. The comment also suggests errors were made in Ashby (2008 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10) while implementing the fitting routines on which the conclusions were based. The main contention of the comment is shown to be invalid because retarded time was not properly used in constructing a fictitious cube position. Such a fictitious position, fixed relative to the falling cube, is derived and shown to be dependent on cube dimensions and refractive index. An example is given showing how in the present context, polynomials of fourth order can be effectively matched by determining only three quantities, and a new compact characterization of the interference signal arriving at the detector is given.</p>
