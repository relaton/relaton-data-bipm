abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A compact and stable UV monitoring source based on state-of-the-art
    commercially available ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) has been developed.
    It is designed to trace the radiometric stability—both responsivity and wavelength
    scale—of array spectroradiometers measuring direct solar irradiance in the wavelength
    range between 300 nm and 400 nm. The spectral irradiance stability of the UV-LED-based
    light source observed in the laboratory after seasoning (burning-in) the individual
    LEDs was better than 0.3% over a 12 h period of continuous operation. The integral
    irradiance measurements of the source over a period of several months, where the
    UV-LED source was not operated continuously between the measurements, showed stability
    within 0.3%. In-field measurements of the source with an array spectroradiometer
    indicated the stability of the source to be within the standard uncertainty of
    the spectroradiometer calibration, which was within 1% to 2%.</p>
