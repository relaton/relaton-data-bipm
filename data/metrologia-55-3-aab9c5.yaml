abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The comment (Nagornyi 2018 Metrologia) claims that, notwithstanding
    the conclusions stated in the paper Relativistic theory of the falling cube gravimeter
    (Ashby 2008 Metrologia 55 1–10), there is no need to consider the dimensions or
    refractive index of the cube in fitting data from falling cube absolute gravimeters;
    additional questions are raised about matching quartic polynomials while determining
    only three quantities. The comment also suggests errors were made in Ashby (2008
    Metrologia 55 1–10) while implementing the fitting routines on which the conclusions
    were based. The main contention of the comment is shown to be invalid because
    retarded time was not properly used in constructing a fictitious cube position.
    Such a fictitious position, fixed relative to the falling cube, is derived and
    shown to be dependent on cube dimensions and refractive index. An example is given
    showing how in the present context, polynomials of fourth order can be effectively
    matched by determining only three quantities, and a new compact characterization
    of the interference signal arriving at the detector is given.</p>
