    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this work, the consistency of the heat pulse-based melting technique, which was used to determine the liquidus temperature of tin, was examined by comparing the liquidus temperatures of tin at 101 325 Pa and at the vapour pressure of tin (i.e. the triple-point temperature), both of which were realized by heat pulse-based melting. Periodic square wave-type temperature steps with an amplitude of 0.7 °C were generated in the isothermal region of the pressure-controlled loop heat pipe, and the tin sample, having a segregated impurity distribution established by the prior outward slow freezing, was melted by application of the temperature step-based heat pulses. The triple-point temperature was found to be lower than the liquidus temperature of tin at 101 325 Pa by 3.23 mK with an expanded measurement uncertainty of 0.24 mK (i.e. a coverage factor of <italic>k</italic>  =  2), while the ideal temperature difference calculated from the ITS-90 given pressure coefficient (i.e. 3.3  ×  10<sup>−8</sup> K Pa<sup>−1</sup>) is about 3.34 mK. The difference between the measured temperature difference and ideal temperature difference was attributed to the incomplete removal of the gases in the tin triple-point cell. Overall, these results further corroborated the notion that the heat pulse-based melting technique was shown to yield results consistent with the prescription of the ITS-90, and to be a reliable method in terms of the realization of the fixed-point temperatures.</p>
