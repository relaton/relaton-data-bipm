abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this work, the consistency of the heat pulse-based melting
    technique, which was used to determine the liquidus temperature of tin, was examined
    by comparing the liquidus temperatures of tin at 101 325 Pa and at the vapour
    pressure of tin (i.e. the triple-point temperature), both of which were realized
    by heat pulse-based melting. Periodic square wave-type temperature steps with
    an amplitude of 0.7 °C were generated in the isothermal region of the pressure-controlled
    loop heat pipe, and the tin sample, having a segregated impurity distribution
    established by the prior outward slow freezing, was melted by application of the
    temperature step-based heat pulses. The triple-point temperature was found to
    be lower than the liquidus temperature of tin at 101 325 Pa by 3.23 mK with an
    expanded measurement uncertainty of 0.24 mK (i.e. a coverage factor of k  =  2),
    while the ideal temperature difference calculated from the ITS-90 given pressure
    coefficient (i.e. 3.3  ×  10<sup>−8</sup> K Pa<sup>−1</sup>) is about 3.34 mK.
    The difference between the measured temperature difference and ideal temperature
    difference was attributed to the incomplete removal of the gases in the tin triple-point
    cell. Overall, these results further corroborated the notion that the heat pulse-based
    melting technique was shown to yield results consistent with the prescription
    of the ITS-90, and to be a reliable method in terms of the realization of the
    fixed-point temperatures.</p>
