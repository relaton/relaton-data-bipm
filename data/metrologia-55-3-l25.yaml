abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This discussion article begins by highlighting the benefits
    of the moleâ€™s incorporation within the international system of units (SI), in
    particular by bringing chemical measurement within formal metrology structures.
    The origins of the confusion that has consistently existed between amount of substance
    (the base quantity of which the mole is the SI base unit) and counting quantities
    are examined in detail and their differentiating characteristics fully elaborated
    on. The importance and benefits of distinguishing between these different quantities
    and the role that the Avogadro constant plays in doing this are highlighted. It
    is proposed that these issues are becoming increasingly important for two reasons.
    First, as chemistry and biology consider increasingly small size domains, measurements
    are being made of significantly reduced collections of entities. Second, the proposed
    re-definition of the mole makes the link between amount of substance and the number
    of elementary entities more transparent. Finally, proposals for new ways of expressing
    very low amounts of substance in terms of new prefixes based on the numerical
    value of the Avogadro constant are presented as a way to encourage the use of
    the mole, when appropriate, even for ultra-low level chemical measurement.</p>
