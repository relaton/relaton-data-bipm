abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A small portable transfer radiometer has been developed as part
    of an effort to ensure the quality of upwelling radiance from test sites used
    for vicarious calibration in the solar reflective. The test sites are used to
    predict top-of-atmosphere reflectance relying on ground-based measurements of
    the atmosphere and surface. The portable transfer radiometer is designed for one-person
    operation for on-site field calibration of instrumentation used to determine ground-leaving
    radiance. The current work describes the detector- and source-based radiometric
    calibration of the transfer radiometer highlighting the expected accuracy and
    SI-traceability. The results indicate differences between the detector-based and
    source-based results greater than the combined uncertainties of the approaches.
    Results from recent field deployments of the transfer radiometer using a solar
    radiation based calibration agree with the source-based laboratory calibration
    within the combined uncertainties of the methods. The detector-based results show
    a significant difference to the solar-based calibration. The source-based calibration
    is used as the basis for a radiance-based calibration of the Landsat-8 Operational
    Land Imager that agrees with the OLI calibration to within the uncertainties of
    the methods.</p>
