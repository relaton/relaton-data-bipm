abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe a new method for the accurate alignment of verticality
    in absolute gravimeters with macroscopic objects that allows simultaneous determination
    of the Eötvös effect. The method is based on measurements of lateral motion of
    freely falling objects by a position sensitive detector, and has been used experimentally
    for one FG5 and one FG5X gravimeter. As for the verticality effect, we show that
    the current method of verticality alignment by using the reflection off the geopotential
    surface placed outside the vacuum dropping chamber is insufficient, and that systematic
    errors exceeding 1 µGal might be expected—as demonstrated for FG5X-251. On the
    other hand, the new method of verticality alignment, based on minimizing the measured
    lateral accelerations, allows the reduction of systematic errors to about 0.1
    µGal. Moreover, the measurements underlying the alignment can be used for determination
    of the Eötvös effect, which depends on the lateral velocity of the falling object
    in the east–west direction. The results for two FG5(X) gravimeters are presented,
    with Eötvös effects below 1 µGal that, however, cause biased gravity values so
    that relevant corrections should be applied. The method we are presenting does
    not allow determination of the verticality and Eötvös effects for particular drops.
    To do so, optical paths in the interferometer should have to be re-designed. Nevertheless,
    it is possible to determine both effects with a standard uncertainty better than
    0.2 µGal using less than 50 drops carried out in a non-measurement mode.</p>
