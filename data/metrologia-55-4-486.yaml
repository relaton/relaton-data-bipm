    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The cosmological constant, usually referred to as Lambda, was introduced by Einstein in 1917 and then abandoned by him as his biggest ‘blunder’. It currently seems to have made a spectacular comeback in the framework of the new cosmological standard model. I will explain why, together with Planck’s constant, Boltzmann’s constant, the celerity of light, and Newton’s constant, also considered by Einstein, the cosmological constant may play a foundational role in the conceptual framework, and in the metrological framework in a role comparable to the one attributed to the Avogadro constant.</p>
