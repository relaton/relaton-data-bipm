abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The cosmological constant, usually referred to as Lambda, was
    introduced by Einstein in 1917 and then abandoned by him as his biggest ‘blunder’.
    It currently seems to have made a spectacular comeback in the framework of the
    new cosmological standard model. I will explain why, together with Planck’s constant,
    Boltzmann’s constant, the celerity of light, and Newton’s constant, also considered
    by Einstein, the cosmological constant may play a foundational role in the conceptual
    framework, and in the metrological framework in a role comparable to the one attributed
    to the Avogadro constant.</p>
