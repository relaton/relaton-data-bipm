abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report here the results of a comparison of electrical impedance
    standards aimed at evaluating four novel digital impedance bridges developed by
    the national metrology institutes CMI, INRIM and METAS. This comparison, which
    is the first of its kind, involved phase angle impedance standards developed by
    TÜBITAK UME with phase angles of  ± and  ±, and magnitudes ranging from about
    100 Ω to 1 MΩ. The comparison demonstrated agreement among the measurement results
    obtained with the different bridges, and allowed us to gather information on the
    stability of the phase standards and on more critical aspects related to the characterization
    of the bridges.</p>
