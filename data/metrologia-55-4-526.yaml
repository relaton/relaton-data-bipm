abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>General lighting is undergoing a revolutionary change towards
    LED-based technologies. To provide firm scientific basis for the related colorimetric
    and photometric measurements, this paper presents the development of new white-LED-based
    illuminants for colorimetry, and their evaluation to recommend a new reference
    spectrum for calibration of photometers. Spectra of 1516 LED products were measured
    and used to calculate eight representative spectral power distributions for LED
    sources of different correlated colour temperature categories. The suitability
    of the calculated representative spectra for photometer calibration was studied
    by comparing average spectral mismatch errors with CIE Standard Illuminant A,
    which has been used for decades as the reference spectrum for incandescent standard
    lamps in calibration of photometers. It was found that in general, when compared
    with Standard Illuminant A, all the potential LED calibration spectra reduced
    spectral mismatch errors when measuring LED products. Out of the potential LED
    calibration spectra tested, the white LED spectrum with correlated colour temperature
    of 4103 K was found to be the most suitable candidate to complement Standard Illuminant
    A in luminous responsivity calibrations of photometers. When compared with Standard
    Illuminant A, employing the 4103 K reference spectrum reduced the spectral mismatch
    errors, on average, by approximately a factor of two in measurements of LED products
    and lighting. Furthermore, the new LED reference spectrum was found to reduce
    the spectral mismatch errors in measurements of daylight, and many types of fluorescent
    and discharge lamps, indicating that the proposed reference spectrum is a viable
    alternative to Standard Illuminant A for calibration of photometers.</p>
