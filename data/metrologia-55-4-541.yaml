abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the realization and the characterization of a picometer
    reference actuator (PRA), a metrological instrument based on a precision linear
    actuator capable of 100 µm range with subnanometer accuracy, picometer resolution,
    and submicroradian tip-tilt pointing control. The PRA relies on an integrated
    multiple reflections homodyne interferometer as a high resolution and accurate
    internal reference, on a multiple reflection based angle sensor for the control
    of the movement straightness, and on a versatile mirrors configuration to transfer
    the metrological traceability to an external device. As an example case we report
    the use of the PRA for the characterization of the non-linearities of the INRIM
    heterodyne interferometer dedicated to the calibration of capacitive sensors.</p>
