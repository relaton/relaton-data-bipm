abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>By using a simple model to relate the electromotive force drift
    rate of Pt–Rh thermoelements to dS/dc, i.e. the sensitivity of the Seebeck coefficient,
    S, to rhodium mass fraction, c, the composition of the optimal pair of Pt–Rh wires
    that minimizes thermoelectric drift can be determined. The model has been applied
    to four multi-wire thermocouples each comprising 5 or 7 Pt–Rh wires of different
    composition. Two thermocouples were exposed to a temperature of around 1324 °C,
    one thermocouple to around 1492 °C, i.e. the melting points of the Co–C and Pd–C
    high temperature fixed points, respectively, and one thermocouple to a series
    of temperatures between 1315 °C and 1450 °C. The duration of exposure at each
    temperature was several thousand hours. By performing repeated calibrations in
    situ with the appropriate fixed point during the high temperature exposure, the
    drift performance has been quantified with high accuracy, entirely free from errors
    associated with thermoelectric homogeneity. By combining these results it is concluded
    that the Pt-40%Rh versus Pt-6%Rh is the most stable at the temperatures investigated.
    A preliminary reference function was determined and is presented.</p>
