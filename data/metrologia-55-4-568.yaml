abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The tungsten–carbon (WC) peritectic, with a liquidus temperature
    near to 3020 K, shows promise as a high-temperature reference fixed point. It
    appears that the WC phase is a discrete phase with full stoichiometry of the components
    W and C, in which impurities cannot be dissolved. In this paper we describe the
    use of Thermo-Calc software to derive the liquidus and solidus temperatures versus
    the impurity concentration for the impurities V and Si. It is found that the liquidus
    is univariant, whereas the solidus is invariant. Additionally, the transition
    curves between the solidus and the liquidus are modeled. The liquid fraction at
    the liquidus point is found to be less than 1; in contrast, it is unity for metal–carbon
    eutectics. Measurements are presented for a series of melting and freezing curves
    for two WC fixed-point cells. The Gibbs phase rule requires segregation of a fourth
    compound phase, involving the impurity in question, at the solidus point. The
    observations confirm that during supercooling, impurities are trapped in compound
    phases consisting of the impurity together with W and/or C, encapsulating the
    impurity, and resulting in a flat freezing plateau characteristic of the pure
    system. Finally, an expression for the melting temperature, as a function of the
    liquid fraction, is derived, spanning the temperature range from an initial melting
    temperature to the liquidus temperature. Within this range just free impurities
    are involved.</p>
