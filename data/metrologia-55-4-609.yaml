abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A recent paper (Ashby 2018 Metrologia 55 1) provides a rigorous
    relativistic treatment of the laser interferometer with a free-falling cube retroreflector.
    When considering the phase shift due to the light propagation within the glass
    cube, the associated effect was found to be 6.8 µGal. The constant phase shift
    was misinterpreted in the data analysis, producing a pseudo effect. We show that
    the time-dependent phase shift within the glass cube causes a negligible bias
    of the computed gravity acceleration and analyze the misconceptions that afforded
    a different conclusion.</p>
