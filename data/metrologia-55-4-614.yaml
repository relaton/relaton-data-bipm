abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the subject paper Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10) of the
    comment Svitlov (2018 Metrologia 55 609–13), light propagation through an absolute
    gravimeter was analyzed, including the propagation delay through the falling retroreflector
    and through the vacuum. The resulting expression for the interference signal applies
    without any subsequent ‘speed of light’ correction. Other corrections appeared
    for the three fitting parameters and g, which are, respectively, the initial position
    and velocity, and the acceleration of gravity at the reference point. The comment
    assumes the value of Z<sub>0</sub> is known a priori; this case was not addressed
    in Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10). Also, the comment misunderstands statements
    made in Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10) regarding the derivation of the relativistic/non-relativistic
    parts of the corrections (equation (47) of Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10)), and
    mistakenly claims they apply to the undifferenced interference signal. In this
    reply we show why, because of inapplicable assumptions, approximations and misunderstandings,
    the comment does not apply to the results of Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10).</p>
