    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the subject paper Ashby (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10) of the comment Svitlov (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 609–13), light propagation through an absolute gravimeter was analyzed, including the propagation delay through the falling retroreflector and through the vacuum. The resulting expression for the interference signal applies without any subsequent ‘speed of light’ correction. Other corrections appeared for the three fitting parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metaac441ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> and <italic>g</italic>, which are, respectively, the initial position and velocity, and the acceleration of gravity at the reference point. The comment assumes the value of <italic>Z</italic><sub>0</sub> is known <italic>a priori</italic>; this case was not addressed in Ashby (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10). Also, the comment misunderstands statements made in Ashby (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10) regarding the derivation of the relativistic/non-relativistic parts of the corrections (equation (47) of Ashby (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10)), and mistakenly claims they apply to the undifferenced interference signal. In this reply we show why, because of inapplicable assumptions, approximations and misunderstandings, the comment does not apply to the results of Ashby (2018 <italic>Metrologia</italic> <bold>55</bold> 1–10).</p>
