abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the subject paper Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10) of the
    comment Svitlov (2018 Metrologia 55 609–13), light propagation through an absolute
    gravimeter was analyzed, including the propagation delay through the falling retroreflector
    and through the vacuum. The resulting expression for the interference signal applies
    without any subsequent ‘speed of light’ correction. Other corrections appeared
    for the three fitting parameters  and g, which are, respectively, the initial
    position and velocity, and the acceleration of gravity at the reference point.
    The comment assumes the value of Z<sub>0</sub> is known a priori; this case was
    not addressed in Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10). Also, the comment misunderstands
    statements made in Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10) regarding the derivation of
    the relativistic/non-relativistic parts of the corrections (equation (47) of Ashby
    (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10)), and mistakenly claims they apply to the undifferenced
    interference signal. In this reply we show why, because of inapplicable assumptions,
    approximations and misunderstandings, the comment does not apply to the results
    of Ashby (2018 Metrologia 55 1–10).</p>
