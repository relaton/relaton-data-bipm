abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A road map for the implementation of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite
    System (BDS) time transfer in coordinated universal time (UTC) has been drawn
    up, including a pilot experiment to evaluate BDS time transfer on multiple baselines.
    In the pilot experiment, several laboratories contributing to UTC have been equipped
    or are planned to be equipped with BDS time and frequency transfer receivers made
    by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM, Beijing). In the first phase, concentrating
    on the evaluation for the global capacity of BDS time transfer, the experiments
    have been implemented on multiple inter-continental baselines, involving NIM,
    Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM, Sevres), other institutes in
    China and the Czech Republic, and stations from the International Global Navigation
    Satellite System (GNSS) Service (IGS) network. The satellite signal coverages
    at various sites were characterized for satellite number, satellite elevation
    and satellite azimuth. Stability and accuracy of time transfer by BDS have been
    evaluated, based on common clock difference and multiple inter-continental baselines
    experiments, concluding agreement between BDS time transfer and GPS time transfer
    and a time stability of less than 1 ns at some thousand seconds averaging time
    at the present satellite coverage of BDS.</p>
