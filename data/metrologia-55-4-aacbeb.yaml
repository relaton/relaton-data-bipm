abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have performed direct dc comparisons between two cryocooled
    10 V programmable Josephson voltage standards. Utilizing an automated synchronization
    scheme for the voltage reversals enables use of a high-sensitivity analog null
    detector on its 10 µV range. No switches or manual operations are necessary to
    protect the null detector from overload signals. The agreement measured between
    the two voltage standards at 10 V is 9 parts in 10<sup>12</sup> with a relative
    combined uncertainty of 29 pV V<sup>−1</sup> (k  =  2 coverage factor). Since
    both systems can be operated floating from ground, various grounding configurations
    of the measurement circuit were investigated to evaluate possible leakage current
    paths to ground. Comparing the two systems under various grounding conditions
    enables minimization of leakage-current errors, optimization of system performance
    by revealing leakage-limiting components, and verification of key elements in
    the uncertainty budget for the measurement method.</p>
