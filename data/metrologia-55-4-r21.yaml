abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Following the recommendations of ICRU Report 90, a re-evaluation
    has been made of the BIPM standards for air kerma in x-rays and in<sup>60</sup>Co
    and<sup>137</sup>Cs γ-radiations, for absorbed dose to water in<sup>60</sup>Co
    γ-radiation and for reference air-kerma rate in<sup>192</sup>Ir γ-radiation for
    brachytherapy. The changes arise from three sources: (i) the implementation of
    new correction factors k<sub>ii</sub> and k<sub>W</sub> for free-air ionization
    chambers; (ii) a re-evaluation of the mean excitation energy for graphite and
    water and the density effect for graphite; (iii) new stated uncertainties for
    the value of W<sub>air</sub> for dry air and for the related product W<sub>air</sub>s<sub>g,air</sub>.
    Consideration has also been given to new recommendations for photon interaction
    coefficients, although no corresponding changes have resulted. The heat defect
    in graphite is also considered. A summary table of the combined effect of these
    changes is presented. The new standards will be implemented on 1 January 2019.</p>'
