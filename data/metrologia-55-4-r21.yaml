    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Following the recommendations of ICRU Report 90, a re-evaluation has been made of the BIPM standards for air kerma in x-rays and in <sup>60</sup>Co and <sup>137</sup>Cs <italic>γ</italic>-radiations, for absorbed dose to water in <sup>60</sup>Co <italic>γ</italic>-radiation and for reference air-kerma rate in <sup>192</sup>Ir <italic>γ</italic>-radiation for brachytherapy. The changes arise from three sources: (i) the implementation of new correction factors <italic>k</italic><sub>ii</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>W</sub> for free-air ionization chambers; (ii) a re-evaluation of the mean excitation energy for graphite and water and the density effect for graphite; (iii) new stated uncertainties for the value of <italic>W</italic><sub>air</sub> for dry air and for the related product <italic>W</italic><sub>air</sub><italic>s</italic><sub>g,air</sub>. Consideration has also been given to new recommendations for photon interaction coefficients, although no corresponding changes have resulted. The heat defect in graphite is also considered. A summary table of the combined effect of these changes is presented. The new standards will be implemented on 1 January 2019.</p>
