    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Graphene-based quantised Hall resistance standards promise high precision for the unit ohm under less exclusive measurement conditions, enabling the use of compact measurement systems. To meet the requirements of metrological applications, national metrology institutes developed large-area monolayer graphene growth methods for uniform material properties and optimized device fabrication techniques. Precision measurements of the quantised Hall resistance showing the advantage of graphene over GaAs-based resistance standards demonstrate the remarkable achievements realized by the research community. This work provides an overview over the state-of-the-art technologies in this field.</p>
