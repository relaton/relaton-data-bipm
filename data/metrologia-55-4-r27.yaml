abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Graphene-based quantised Hall resistance standards promise high
    precision for the unit ohm under less exclusive measurement conditions, enabling
    the use of compact measurement systems. To meet the requirements of metrological
    applications, national metrology institutes developed large-area monolayer graphene
    growth methods for uniform material properties and optimized device fabrication
    techniques. Precision measurements of the quantised Hall resistance showing the
    advantage of graphene over GaAs-based resistance standards demonstrate the remarkable
    achievements realized by the research community. This work provides an overview
    over the state-of-the-art technologies in this field.</p>
