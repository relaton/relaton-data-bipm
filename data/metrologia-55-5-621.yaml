    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The knowledge of atomic fundamental parameters such as the mass attenuation coefficients or fluorescence yields with low uncertainties, is of decisive importance in elemental quantification involving x-ray fluorescence analysis techniques. For example, several databases giving the mass attenuation coefficients are accessible and frequently used within a large community of users. These compilations are most often in good agreement for photon energies in the hard x-ray ranges. However, they significantly differ for low photon energies and around the absorption edges of the elements. Some review articles present compilations of measured fluorescence yields values found in the literature. However reliable measurements are not so many illustrating the inherent difficulties. Mass attenuation coefficients of bismuth were determined experimentally in the photon energy range from 100 eV to 30 keV by using monochromatized synchrotron radiation at SOLEIL (France). The fluorescence yields of the three L-subshells of bismuth were also determined using a reflection geometry setup. The application of high-accuracy experimental techniques resulted in low uncertainty mass attenuation coefficients and L-subshell fluorescence yields that are directly compared to existing databases and with updated relativistic configuration mixing Dirac–Fock calculations including QED corrections.</p>
