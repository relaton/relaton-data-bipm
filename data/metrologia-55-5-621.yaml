abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The knowledge of atomic fundamental parameters such as the mass
    attenuation coefficients or fluorescence yields with low uncertainties, is of
    decisive importance in elemental quantification involving x-ray fluorescence analysis
    techniques. For example, several databases giving the mass attenuation coefficients
    are accessible and frequently used within a large community of users. These compilations
    are most often in good agreement for photon energies in the hard x-ray ranges.
    However, they significantly differ for low photon energies and around the absorption
    edges of the elements. Some review articles present compilations of measured fluorescence
    yields values found in the literature. However reliable measurements are not so
    many illustrating the inherent difficulties. Mass attenuation coefficients of
    bismuth were determined experimentally in the photon energy range from 100 eV
    to 30 keV by using monochromatized synchrotron radiation at SOLEIL (France). The
    fluorescence yields of the three L-subshells of bismuth were also determined using
    a reflection geometry setup. The application of high-accuracy experimental techniques
    resulted in low uncertainty mass attenuation coefficients and L-subshell fluorescence
    yields that are directly compared to existing databases and with updated relativistic
    configuration mixing Dirac–Fock calculations including QED corrections.</p>
