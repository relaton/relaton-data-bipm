abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The correlation of co-located hydrogen masers (H-masers) is
    difficult to measure because their common-mode noise induced by the environment
    will be cancelled out during the comparison measurement. With the development
    of fibre-based high-precision time and frequency transfer techniques, the correlation
    of co-located hydrogen masers can be directly measured with the help of remote
    H-masers. Recently, a fibre-based frequency synchronization network was constructed
    in the Beijing region by connecting five H-masers from four institutions. The
    correlation coefficient of atomic clocks is defined and the correlation between
    two co-located H-masers is measured using both experimental and simulative methods.
    The results show that the correlation is not prominent until the averaging time
    is larger than  ∼10<sup>3</sup> s; then, the coefficient grows rapidly for average
    times ranging from  ∼10<sup>3</sup> s to  ∼10<sup>5</sup> s and decreases beyond  ∼10<sup>5</sup>
    s up to 5 d.</p>
