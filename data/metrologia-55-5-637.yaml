abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a data-driven approach for the flattening
    of atomic force microscopy images. This acquisition process is widely used for
    the characterization of surfaces at the nanoscale. Unfortunately the technique
    is subject to several defects such as linear deviation and jumps. We present a
    data-driven methodology, fast to implement and which accurately corrects these
    deviations. The proposed methodology makes no assumption on the object locations
    and can therefore be used as an efficient preprocessing routine. Experimental
    results show the efficiency of the methodology compared to existing softwares.</p>
