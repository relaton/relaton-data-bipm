abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report precision measurements of a 1 MΩ quantum Hall resistance
    array made of GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. The quantized Hall array resistance
    at filling factor 2 is directly compared with the quantum Hall resistance standard
    with a cryogenic current comparator resistance bridge with a relative measurement
    uncertainty of 17  ×  10<sup>−9</sup> at the 95% confidence level. The robustness
    of quantization in the array is systematically investigated with respect to the
    temperature, magnetic field, and excitation current. We observe through repeated
    thermal cycles that the quantized Hall array resistance is almost unchanged within
    the relative measurement uncertainty, reflecting the invariant nature of high
    resistance close to 1 MΩ. This demonstrates a stable quantum mechanical resistance
    of 1 MΩ as well as the potential for a genuine current-to-voltage converter for
    precision measurements of small current. The observed relative deviation of the
    quantized Hall array resistance from a designed value, verified by a double consistency
    check through a 10 kΩ resistance standard and the Hall array resistance plateau
    at filling factor 4, respectively, is comparable to the relative measurement uncertainty.
    Finally, the associated uncertainty budget and the origin of the measured deviation
    are discussed.</p>
