abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the experimental characterization of predictable
    quantum efficient detectors, which have been designed for use at room temperature.
    The aim of the characterization was to validate modelled properties experimentally
    and, thus, the feasibility of such room temperature predictable quantum efficient
    detectors to be used as primary radiometric standards for applications in the
    fields of photometry and radiometry with an aimed uncertainty level of 0.01. The
    characterizations were focused on linearity, thermal, angular, spectral and polarization
    dependencies of the detector that need to be known and considered in the respective
    applications. The results of the characterization measurements confirm the predictability
    of the detector, within the aimed 0.01 uncertainty level and, thus, the high potential
    for using that kind of devices as primary standards for applications in radiometry
    and photometry.</p>
