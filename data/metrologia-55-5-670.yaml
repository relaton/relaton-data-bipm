abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>One of the aims of the revision of the guide to the expression
    of uncertainty in measurement (GUM), is to make it self-consistent as the current
    edition would combine frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods. The methods
    for type A evaluation of standard uncertainty in the GUM are considered to be
    ‘frequentist’ and hence would have to be replaced by their Bayesian counterparts.
    The aim of this paper is to propose Bayesian methods for four mainstream type
    A evaluations of standard uncertainty, based on the same assumptions as those
    underlying the current methods for type A evaluation given in the GUM. Specific
    attention is given to the computational aspects of the Bayesian methods. An approach
    involving weakly informative prior distributions is proposed to ensure a proper
    posterior distribution, still allowing the data to dominate it. The applications
    for which Bayesian methods are proposed include the calculation of a mean of a
    series of observations, analysis of variance, ordinary least squares and errors-in-variables
    regression. Examples H.3 (ordinary least squares) and H.5 (analysis of variance)
    from the GUM are reworked accordingly.</p><p>The second aim of this paper is to
    propose Bayesian methods for type A evaluation that take the information typically
    available in metrology into account in the form of weakly informative prior distributions.
    These methods can applied in a wide variety of situations. By comparing the results
    from the proposed Bayesian methods involving weakly informative priors with their
    classical counterparts, it is seen that in most instances these methods give very
    similar estimates and standard uncertainties as classical methods do under the
    same conditions and assumptions. Estimates are often identical up to the last
    meaningful digit, and the standard uncertainties are usually slightly yet persistently
    larger in comparison to its classical counterpart. In many cases these differences
    turn out to have limited or little practical meaning, save in the case of a small
    series of observations, where the differences in the computed standard uncertainty
    of the mean is larger.</p>
