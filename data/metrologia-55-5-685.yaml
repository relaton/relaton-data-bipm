abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) is a
    primary technique for the generation of coordinated universal time (UTC). About
    20 timing laboratories around the world continuously operate TWSTFT using satellite
    time and ranging equipment (SATRE) modems for remote time and frequency comparisons
    in this context. The precision of the SATRE TWSTFT as observed today is limited
    by an apparent daily variation pattern (diurnal) in the TWSTFT results. The observed
    peak-to-peak variation have been found as high as 2 ns in some cases. Investigations
    into the origins of the diurnals have so far provided no complete understanding
    about the cause of the diurnals. One major contributor to the diurnals, however,
    could be related to properties of the receive part in the modem. In 2014 and 2015,
    it was demonstrated that bypassing the receive part and the use of software-defined
    radio (SDR) receivers in TWSTFT ground stations (SDR TWSTFT) instead could considerably
    reduce both the diurnals and the measurement noise.</p><p>In 2016, the International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the Consultative Committee for Time
    and Frequency (CCTF) working group (WG) on TWSTFT launched a pilot study on the
    application of SDR receivers in the TWSTFT network for UTC computation.</p><p>The
    first results of the pilot study were reported to the CCTF WG on TWSTFT annual
    meeting in May 2017, demonstrating that SDR TWSTFT shows superior performance
    compared to that of SATRE TWSTFT for practically all links between participating
    stations. In particular, for continental TWSTFT links, in which the strongest
    diurnals appear, the use of SDR TWSTFT results in a significant suppression of
    the diurnals by a factor of between two and three. For the very long inter-continental
    links, e.g. the Europe-to-USA links where the diurnals are less pronounced, SDR
    TWSTFT achieved a smaller but still significant gain of 30%. These findings are
    supported by an evaluation of some of the links with an alternate technique based
    on GPS signals (GPS IPPP) as reported in this paper.</p><p>Stimulated by these
    results, the WG on TWSTFT prepared a recommendation for the 21st CCTF meeting,
    which proposed the introduction of SDR TWSTFT in UTC generation. With CCTF approval
    of the recommendation, a roadmap was developed for the implementation of SDR TWSTFT
    in UTC generation. In accordance with the roadmap, most of the stations that participated
    in the pilot study have updated the SDR TWSTFT settings to facilitate the use
    of SDR TWSTFT data in UTC generation. In addition, the BIPM conducted a final
    evaluation to validate the long-term stability of SDR TWSTFT links, made test
    runs using the BIPM standard software for the calculation of UTC, now including
    SDR TWSTFT data, and started to calculate SDR TWSTFT time links as backup from
    October 2017. The use of SDR TWSTFT in UTC generation will begin in 2018.</p>
