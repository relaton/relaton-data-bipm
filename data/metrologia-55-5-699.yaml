    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report the characterisation and calibration of a new laser pulse energy measurement device, developed for pico-joule pulse energy measurement at repetition rates up to 1â€‰kHz. The device comprises a charge integration amplifier operating in conjunction with an input charge source; a light trapping photo-detector, which converts an incident laser pulse to a charge pulse. The novel amplifier individually integrates each charge pulse from the source and outputs a corresponding 20-bit resolution digital signal. This signal is converted to pulse energy through post processing, knowing the absolute responsivity of the photodiode detector and the calibration factors of the charge amplifier. A differential evolution algorithm is used to determine optimised values for the feedback capacitors of the amplifier, the amplifier gain and offset.</p>
    <p>The values measured by the new laser pulse energy meter were compared with those obtained from measurements traceable to both the high and low-level laser pulse energy scales maintained by NIST, Boulder. These were consistent within the combined expanded measurement uncertainty. This new device offers lower uncertainty and portability, suitable for field use.</p>
