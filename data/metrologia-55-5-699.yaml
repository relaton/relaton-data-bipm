abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the characterisation and calibration of a new laser
    pulse energy measurement device, developed for pico-joule pulse energy measurement
    at repetition rates up to 1â€‰kHz. The device comprises a charge integration amplifier
    operating in conjunction with an input charge source; a light trapping photo-detector,
    which converts an incident laser pulse to a charge pulse. The novel amplifier
    individually integrates each charge pulse from the source and outputs a corresponding
    20-bit resolution digital signal. This signal is converted to pulse energy through
    post processing, knowing the absolute responsivity of the photodiode detector
    and the calibration factors of the charge amplifier. A differential evolution
    algorithm is used to determine optimised values for the feedback capacitors of
    the amplifier, the amplifier gain and offset.</p><p>The values measured by the
    new laser pulse energy meter were compared with those obtained from measurements
    traceable to both the high and low-level laser pulse energy scales maintained
    by NIST, Boulder. These were consistent within the combined expanded measurement
    uncertainty. This new device offers lower uncertainty and portability, suitable
    for field use.</p>
