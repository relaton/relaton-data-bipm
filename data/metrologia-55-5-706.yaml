abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>NIST has completed commissioning a new, state-of-the-art cryogenic
    primary standard for optical fibre power measurement and calibration. It establishes
    for the first time, a direct traceability route between the device under test
    and primary standard. Two silicon micro-machined planar detectors, with vertically
    aligned carbon nanotube absorbers, thin film tungsten heaters and superconducting
    resistive transition edge temperature transducers, form the basis of the radiometer.
    Magnetic phase change thermal filters ensure noise-free operation at 7.6 K. Measurement
    repeatability below 50 ppm is routinely achieved during a measurement cycle of
    30 min. The system operates at a nominal radiant power level of 200 µW (−7 dBm).
    The expanded measurement uncertainty at k  =  2 is 0.4%, a 20% improvement on
    NIST’s current optical fibre power Calibration and Measurement Capability.</p><p>The
    performance of the new standard was established by comparing it to our current
    standard, using four transfer detectors, at nominal wavelengths 850 nm, 1295 nm
    and 1550 nm. The comparison agreed within the combined expanded measurement uncertainty
    of 0.6%. Whilst the new standard is intended primarily to service the telecommunications
    industry, it is limited in use only by available sources and optical fibre.</p>
