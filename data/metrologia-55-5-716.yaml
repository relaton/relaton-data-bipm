abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Measurement units have historically been defined as quantities
    (i.e. specific properties) of objects, such as the mass of a particular piece
    of metal or the length of a particular rod. While the current International System
    of Units (SI) Brochure endorses this position, the draft 9th SI Brochure proposes
    to change it, and instead define measurement units as values of quantities. The
    reason for this proposed change is not provided, but it does not seem plausible
    that it is related to the redefinition of the SI units in terms of fundamental
    constants of nature: the very concept of what a unit is does not depend on the
    concrete way any given unit is defined. This paper is intended to open a discussion
    of whether measurement units should be defined as quantities or as quantity values,
    and provides our rationale for maintaining the definition of units as quantities.</p>'
