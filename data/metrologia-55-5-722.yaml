abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>According to the 2013 recommendation of the Consultative Committee
    for Mass and Related Quantities (CCM), the upcoming redefinition of the kilogram
    based on the value of the Planck constant specifies that ‘ at least three independent
    experiments, including work from Watt balance and XRCD experiments, yield consistent
    values of the Planck constant with relative standard uncertainties not larger
    than ’, and that ‘ at least one of these results should have a relative standard
    uncertainty not larger than ’. The consistency condition is questioned by the
    most recent measurement results for the Planck constant. To nonetheless proceed
    with the redefinition of the kilogram, the CCM proposes in its 2017 recommendation
    that the results of an ongoing key comparison are used for a correction of future
    measurement results, to ensure the consistent dissemination of the redefined kilogram.</p><p>Two
    corresponding correction procedures are presented and discussed. The procedures
    make different assumptions about the temporal behavior of potential inconsistencies
    and they are based on established models from statistics for meta-analysis. Simple
    formulas are derived which provide a reasonable approximation, and which illustrate
    the basic principles of the correction procedures. Potentials and risks in the
    application of these procedures are explored, and the procedures are applied to
    the most recent measurement results for the Planck constant. Only one of the two
    procedures produces sufficiently small uncertainties for corrected measurement
    results in the sense of the CCM 2013 recommendation. The procedures and their
    assumptions are discussed, and we critically assess the attempt to reestablish
    consistency in a redefinition of the kilogram through a statistical correction
    procedure. Finally, we draw some conclusions.</p>
