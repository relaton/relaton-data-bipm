abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The non-linear response of RAMSES hyperspectral radiometers
    was characterized in the 450 nm–800 nm spectral region. Results indicate inverse
    proportionality of the non-linearity with the output counts. The departure from
    linearity is generally within  ±1.5% with maxima at the longest wavelengths. Notably,
    the consistency of results across different instruments suggests the possibility
    of applying corrections to the entire class of RAMSES radiometers with residuals
    generally lower than 0.3%. Finally, an analysis based on field measurements from
    different water types indicates that non-linearity can contribute up to 1.5% to
    the relative uncertainties affecting spectra of remote sensing reflectance.</p>
