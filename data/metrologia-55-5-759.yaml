abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The paper describes the development and characterisation of
    metrological characteristics of reference Vickers hardness blocks for the high
    hardness range, development of the system for indentation analysis and interlaboratory
    comparison. The primary goal of the research was to develop the reference Vickers
    hardness block from nanostructured hardmetal with a hardness value of approximately
    2000 HV1. Based on long-term and extensive research, reference Vickers hardness
    blocks with optimal metrological characteristics were selected and presented in
    the paper. Two blocks were consolidated using different powder metallurgy processes;
    sintering in a hydrogen atmosphere and a sinter hot isostatic pressing (sinter-HIP)
    process were described. The surfaces of the blocks were researched in terms of
    material and metrological characteristics and prepared to maintain the requirements
    according to EN ISO 6507-3:2005, concerning flatness, parallelism and surface
    roughness. In order to achieve more accurate and precise measurements of the indentations,
    the lengths of diagonals were measured using the 1D optical measurement system
    (1D OMS) developed by the National Laboratory for Length HMI/FSB-LPMD for high
    accuracy line scale calibration. Custom software was developed in Visual Studio
    2012. To confirm the reliability of the hardness values determined by the 1D OMS
    and newly developed software for indentation analysis, the interlaboratory comparison
    was performed on the primary micro-hardness machine installed in the Physikalische-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany. From the conducted research it was concluded that
    preliminary Vickers hardness blocks were developed successfully from nanostructured
    hardmetals. Higher hardness and lower non-uniformities over the test surface were
    achieved for fully dense blocks consolidated by a sinter-HIP process. The intercomparison
    confirmed the reliability of the measured results determined on the reference
    hardness standard and 1D OMS with newly developed software.</p>
