abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Absolute measurements of water vapor densities have been carried
    out using a new concept of frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy.
    Our scheme is based on the use of a pair of phase-locked extended cavity diode
    lasers, emitting at 1.39     m, one of them being locked to a self-referenced
    optical frequency comb synthesizer. An intrinsically stable high-finesse optical
    cavity that tracks the laser frequency scans has been used. High quality, comb-calibrated,
    absorption spectra have been recorded in a certified H<sub>2</sub>O/N<sub>2</sub>
    gas mixture at different gas pressures, in coincidence with the 2     transition
    of the H<sub>2</sub> <sup>18</sup>O       +       band. Water vapor mole fractions
    have been determined with a statistical uncertainty of 0.6. Systematic deviations
    have been identified and carefully quantified, thus leading to an overall uncertainty
    of 0.8.</p>
