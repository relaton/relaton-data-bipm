abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When employing gravimetric or volumetric methods for calibrating
    volumetric measures, proving tanks, pipe provers and flowmeters, water is often
    used as the calibration medium. Knowledge of the density of water is required
    along with other properties such as compressibility, viscosity and speed of sound.
    In the scientific literature, different formulae are proposed to express these
    properties of water. This is particularly noticeable for formulae for the density
    of water where different formulae have been taken into International Standards
    from ISO, OIML, API and the EI. The difference in formulae does not generally
    give rise to significant differences in density however even small inconsistencies
    may cause problems for trade when differences in the value of a product occur.
    It has also been evident that some formulae are being specified and used outside
    their range of applicability. In this paper, some of the most commonly referenced
    expressions have been summarised and compared. As initially the referenced formulae
    are all for pure water, the paper recognises that impure water, from potable drinking
    water through to brine may be used. Formulae to express the properties of saline
    water have therefore also been identified. The aim of the paper is to provide
    a set of practical formulae which can be used to reduce differences in measurement,
    ensure low uncertainties for measurement, and provide a reference source to identify
    un-attributed formulae where they occur. Practical formulae have been proposed
    and will apply equally to measurement at the highest levels of volume determinations
    through to industrial and scientific volume and flow measurement applications
    using water across a temperature range 0 °C–90 °C and salinity 0 to 120 g kg<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
