abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper reviews the recent evolution of the measurement techniques
    in the area of impedance measurement from the Wheatstone bridge to the most advanced
    Josephson-based digital impedance bridge. The progress in the development of high
    sampling rate, high accuracy digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters
    has led to the development of digital impedance bridges that have profoundly modified
    the landscape of impedance metrology. Although these new bridges do not yet outperform
    the traditional transformer-based bridge in terms of accuracy, they significantly
    improve their measurement capabilities and flexibility by allowing a complete
    automation, a full coverage of the complex plane, arbitrary bridge ratios and
    extended frequency range. In addition, after the redefinition of the International
    System of Unit, they will contribute to the realization of the henry and the farad
    by establishing a direct link between the quantized Hall resistance and the capacitance
    or inductance standards.</p>
