abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We review the waveform metrology program developed over many
    years at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The goal of this
    program is to provide a measurement service capable of characterizing both temporal
    and frequency-domain instrumentation used with high-speed communication systems.
    Under our program, full waveforms as functions of both time and frequency are
    the target measurands. From these functional waveforms, traditional parametric
    descriptions can be derived. Furthermore, we give temporal waveforms and their
    frequency-domain representations consistent and equal consideration, with traceability
    to the International System of Units. To support this traceability, we emphasize
    voltage and current waveforms, their relationships, and the ability to transform
    both nominal values and their uncertainties from one domain to the other.</p>
