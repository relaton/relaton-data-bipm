abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For decades, the quantum behavior of Josephson junctions has
    been employed as intrinsic standards for voltage metrology. Conventional dc Josephson
    voltage standards have been the primary standards for voltage, programmable Josephson
    voltage standards have been implemented in calibration services and precision
    measurements, such as the Planck constant, and Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizers
    have been employed in ac voltage calibrations and precision measurements of the
    Boltzmann constant. With the anticipated redefinition of the Système International
    d’Unités, all types of Josephson voltage standards will become intrinsic standards
    and equivalent realizations of the unit volt. Here we review the state-of-the
    art performance, best practices, and current impact of these systems for various
    applications, with an emphasis on ac voltage metrology. We explain the limitations
    of each system, especially regarding the many potential systematic errors that
    affect their accuracy and performance for specific applications.</p>
