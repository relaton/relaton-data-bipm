abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Metrological traceability is the property of a measurement result
    whereby it can be related to a stated reference through a documented unbroken
    chain of calibrations, each contributing to the measurement uncertainty. The stated
    reference can be the International System of Units, and more specifically a realisation
    of a primary standard with its value and uncertainty expressed in SI units, which
    offers many benefits such as long term stability and the ability to reproduce
    the standard within its stated uncertainty at any time. Alternatively, measurements
    can be made traceable to an empirical scale, an approach that has evolved for
    practical reasons to meet the needs of certain measurement communities. We explore
    the benefits and drawbacks of these two measurements systems as they have evolved
    for greenhouse gas measurements at background levels and outline the advantages
    of using elements from each to secure a more robust measurement infrastructure.
    In particular, this work examines the importance of compatibility, the accuracy
    of measurement results and the benefits of comparisons with independent primary
    standards.</p>
