abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Cold atoms are excellent metrological tools; they currently
    realize SI time and, soon, SI pressure in the ultra-high (UHV) and extreme high
    vacuum (XHV) regimes. The development of primary, vacuum metrology based on cold
    atoms currently falls under the purview of national metrology institutes. Under
    the emerging paradigm of the ‘quantum-SI’, these technologies become deployable
    (relatively easy-to-use sensors that integrate with other vacuum chambers), providing
    a primary realization of the pascal in the UHV and XHV for the end-user. Here,
    we discuss the challenges that this goal presents. We investigate, for two different
    modes of operation, the expected corrections to the ideal cold-atom vacuum gauge
    and estimate the associated uncertainties. Finally, we discuss the appropriate
    choice of sensor atom, the light Li atom rather than the heavier Rb.</p>
