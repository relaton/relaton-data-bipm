abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Frequency domain spectroscopy allows an experimenter to establish
    optical properties of solids in a wide frequency band including the technically
    challenging 10 THz region, and in other bands enabling metrological comparison
    between competing techniques. We advance a method for extracting the optical properties
    of high-index solids using only transmission-mode frequency domain spectroscopy
    of plane-parallel Fabryâ€“Perot optical flats. We show that different data processing
    techniques yield different kinds of systematic error, and that some commonly used
    techniques have inherent systematic errors which are underappreciated. We use
    model datasets to cross-compare algorithms in isolation from experimental errors,
    and propose a new algorithm which has qualitatively different systematic errors
    to its competitors. We show that our proposal is more robust to experimental non-idealities
    such as noise or apodization, and extract the complex refractive index spectrum
    of crystalline silicon as a practical example. Finally, we advance the idea that
    algorithms are complementary rather than competitive, and should be used together
    as part of a toolbox for better metrology.</p>
