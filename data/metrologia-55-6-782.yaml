abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the operation of a Cs fountain primary frequency
    standard using as a reference for its microwave source a hydrogen maser located
    in a remote laboratory up to hundreds of kilometres away. The 10 MHz reference
    signal for the microwave synthesizer is transferred via a dedicated optical fibre
    link with an electronically stabilized time delay. Such referencing to a remote
    maser was first tested with a 50 km spooled fibre on two separate fountain systems
    using either a quartz-based microwave source or an ultrastable optically-derived
    one. We subsequently ran two fountains with quartz-based local oscillators, one
    co-located with a referencing maser and the second linked to it by 34 km of buried
    optical fibre forming part of telecommunication infrastructure. Finally, the second
    fountain was referenced to a different maser located much farther away via a link
    extended to 390 km. We find that in all configurations the addition of the delay-stabilized
    fibre link, delivering the remote 10 MHz reference, does not degrade the short-term
    stability of the fountain standard—as long as the bandwidth of a servo locking
    the local oscillator to the maser reference is optimized.</p>
