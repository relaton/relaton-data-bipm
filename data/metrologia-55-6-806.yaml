abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Frequency response functions (FRFs) are routinely used within
    experimental structural dynamics, among other fields. The uncertainty associated
    with their measurement is typically modelled on the simplified assumption that
    additive uncorrelated noise is present. This treatment of FRF uncertainty is questioned
    here by demonstrating that the notion of operator uncertainty (i.e. the uncertainty
    due to inconsistent force excitation) introduces a correlation between measured
    FRFs which is not accounted for under the assumption of additive noise. The origin
    of this correlation is illustrated and its experimental presence verified. The
    importance of this correlation on the propagation of uncertainty is subsequently
    investigated as part of a numerical and experimental case study, where its influence
    on the inversion of an uncertain FRF matrix is considered. It is shown that the
    neglect of such correlations can lead to large errors in uncertainty estimates,
    for example in dynamic sub-structuring and the solution of inverse problems.</p>
