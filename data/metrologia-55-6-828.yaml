abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This paper presents a novel dual-polarized refractive index
    sensor based on D-shaped photonic crystal fiber. Unlike the traditional D-shaped
    structures, we use a micro-opening of the deposited gold film as microfluidic
    channel to excite the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) mode. The fiber consists
    of two layers of circular pores arranged in an octagonal lattice structure. By
    optimizing the structural parameters of the fiber, the proposed sensor detection
    range: the refractive index of the analyte changes from 1.26 to 1.36. Numerical
    simulation based on the finite element method shows that the average sensitivities
    in the x- and y- polarization modes are 1182 nm RIU<sup>−1</sup> and 5736 nm RIU<sup>−1</sup>,
    respectively. When the refractive index of the analyte to be measured is 1.36,
    the highest sensitivity of the x and y polarization directions is 1298 nm RIU<sup>−1</sup>
    and 11 039 nm RIU<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Among them, the resonance wavelength
    and the resonance intensity increase with the refractive index of the sample to
    be tested. In addition, we further analyzed the effects of microfluidic channel
    size, deposited gold film thickness, sensing region length and the overall structure
    of the fiber (polishing depth, inner cladding pore size, etc) on sensor transmission
    characteristics.</p>'
