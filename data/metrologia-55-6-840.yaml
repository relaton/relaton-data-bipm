    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A new robust pairwise statistic, the pairwise median scaled difference (MSD), is proposed for the detection of anomalous location/uncertainty pairs in heteroscedastic interlaboratory study data with associated uncertainties. The distribution for the IID case is presented and approximate critical values for routine use are provided. The determination of observation-specific quantiles and <italic>p</italic>-values for heteroscedastic data, using parametric bootstrapping, is demonstrated by example. The theoretical breakdown point is high due to the use of a median, offering strong resistance to extreme secondary location/uncertainty pairs. Short simulations are used to illustrate test power and robustness for some simple cases; these suggest good power and very good resistance to the effects of secondary outlying values.</p>
