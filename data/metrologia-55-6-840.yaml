abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A new robust pairwise statistic, the pairwise median scaled
    difference (MSD), is proposed for the detection of anomalous location/uncertainty
    pairs in heteroscedastic interlaboratory study data with associated uncertainties.
    The distribution for the IID case is presented and approximate critical values
    for routine use are provided. The determination of observation-specific quantiles
    and p-values for heteroscedastic data, using parametric bootstrapping, is demonstrated
    by example. The theoretical breakdown point is high due to the use of a median,
    offering strong resistance to extreme secondary location/uncertainty pairs. Short
    simulations are used to illustrate test power and robustness for some simple cases;
    these suggest good power and very good resistance to the effects of secondary
    outlying values.</p>
