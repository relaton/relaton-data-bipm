abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Uncertainty formulae are derived for propagating both correlated
    and uncorrelated components of uncertainty in spectral responsivity measurements
    directly through the Planck integrals for the radiation thermometry range of the
    international temperature scale of 1990 (ITS-90) and for absolute radiometry.
    These formulae are compared to those obtained using the Sakuma–Hattori equation
    as an approximation to the Planck integrals. It is shown that for typical spectral
    responsivity bandwidths, the differences are negligible, confirming that the Sakuma–Hattori
    approximation provides an excellent model for the basis of uncertainty propagation
    for radiation thermometry, resulting in simpler and more intuitive uncertainty
    equations.</p>
