abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The indicated value on the displaying device of a digital measuring
    instrument is usually considered as the resultant of rounding the measurand value
    to the nearest indication. This hypothesis is conventional and forms the basis
    of estimating the resolution uncertainty associated with digital indications.
    However, the essential quantization process needed in converting the measurand
    analog signal into a digital form makes the precise estimation of the resolution
    uncertainty shift from the one based on the aforementioned hypothesis. In this
    study, the effect of the quantization process on the resolution uncertainty was
    analyzed, a proposed algorithm for the estimation process was presented, and finally
    the impact of noise presence was considered. Based on the current study, the measurement
    result usually has a shift from the indicated value. In the presence of noise,
    the resolution uncertainty of stable indications can be reduced if the peak-to-peak
    noise could be quantified with adequate accuracy.</p><p>Also, the current study
    recommends the revision of the broad applicability of the conventional estimation
    method of the resolution uncertainty and encourages standardization bodies to
    specify the main requirements in digital measuring instruments that guarantee
    their indicating behavior.</p>
