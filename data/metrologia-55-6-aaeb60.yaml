abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Charged functional groups on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals
    (CNCs) are important for controlling the colloidal stability of suspensions and
    the interaction of the material with its environment. Quantification of surface
    groups is therefore an important metric for reproducible production of this nanomaterial.
    Here we report the results of an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) with twelve
    participants piloted by National Research Council Canada (NRC) that evaluated
    two methods for determining the sulfur content for an NRC reference material (CNCD-1)
    produced from CNCs extracted by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of wood pulp. Inductively
    coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was used to measure the
    total sulfur content of CNCs after microwave assisted digestion in strong acid.
    Conductometric titration quantified the negatively charged sulfate half-ester
    groups on the CNC surface after dialysis and protonation using ion exchange resin.
    The data was analyzed with an ASTM method that employs h and k statistics to identify
    data sets for which the laboratory mean or standard deviation show excessive variation
    from the overall mean or standard deviation and the NIST consensus builder (NICOB)
    engine using the DerSimonian–Laird meta-analysis to determine a consensus estimate
    of the mean and its associated measurement uncertainty. The consensus estimates  ±  uncertainty
    for total sulfur and sulfate half ester content were (8771  ±  94) mg kg<sup>−1</sup>
    and (252.0  ±  8.2) mmol kg<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Neither approach identified
    any outliers in the data sets and the consensus estimates were in agreement with
    values obtained during certification of the reference material. The results confirmed
    that the difference between the sulfur content measured by conductometric titration
    and ICP-OES is larger than the combined 95% expanded uncertainties. The higher
    sulfur content measured by ICP-OES may reflect the presence of sulfur impurities
    that are not detected by titration. Overall the ILC provides validation for the
    protocols for the two methods and indicates that both are reasonably tolerant
    of small variations from the protocol. A more reliable method of assessing the
    titration endpoint and a quality control (QC) sample were identified as potential
    improvements to reduce variability for the conductometric titration.</p>
