abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Phosphorus is an essential element in the human body and an
    important clinical biomarker in serum. However, the lack of reference method that
    is traceable to the International System of Units and matrix-matched certified
    reference material (CRM) pose a major challenge in the assessment of the accuracy
    of phosphorus measurements. A higher order measurement procedure for total phosphorus
    in human serum by standard addition method using high-resolution sector field
    inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was established. In this method,
    germanium and gallium are used as internal standards. The accuracy of the measurement
    was evaluated by comparing the results with the certified values of Trace Elements
    in Tea Leaf Powder (NMIJ CRM 7505-a) and Trace Elements in Milk Powder (NMIJ CRM
    7512-a), as well as the reference value of Electrolytes in Frozen Human Serum
    (NIST SRM 956d). This method had also been applied in an international interlaboratory
    comparison (CCQM-K139 Elements in Human Serum). The results of this comparison
    showed that this method is comparable with the methods used by other established
    national metrology institutes or designated institutes. In addition, the first
    human serum reference material that is certified for total phosphorus was produced.
    This reference material is valuable for method development as well as the assessment
    of the accuracy of phosphorus measurements in clinical laboratories (as quality
    control).</p>
