abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Supplement one of the ‘Guide to the Expression of Uncertainties
    in Measurements (GUM)’ recommends to estimate measurement uncertainties by Monte
    Carlo calculations. For computationally expensive models, Monte Carlo sampling
    can be often only realized for a small number of samples. This may cause inaccurate
    or even useless results for problems with a slow convergence rate. In this paper
    we apply a recently developed method that enables the Bayesian approach to determine
    the geometry of photo masks from measurements in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scatterometry.
    The key idea of this approach is the construction of an efficient surrogate model
    which reduces the computational costs of sampling steps by several orders of magnitude.
    This allows us to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to determine the posterior
    distribution of desired critical dimensions of the photo mask geometry. The Bayesian
    approach leads to substantially larger uncertainties of the critical dimension
    than the previously employed maximum likelihood approach. The results for critical
    dimensions and line edge roughness are consistent with independent atomic force
    measurements of a test photo mask arrays from which scatterometric data were used.</p>
