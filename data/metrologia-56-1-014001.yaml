abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recently, following an alert regarding possible problems of
    toxicity issued by national medicine authorities, thousands of patients with hip
    implants have been recalled for a set of analysis, including cobalt determinations
    in blood and urine. Within this framework, additional measurements of cobalt levels
    in hair are recommended to monitor the release of metals in the body after surgery.
    Aiming at a clinical application, the standardization of the hair washing protocol
    used to remove possible external contamination is essential. To this aim, a method
    suggested by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and based on repeated
    washings with acetone and deionized water was tested. Specifically, hair samples
    of two healthy subjects and three patients were measured at different steps of
    the washing sequence to observe the decrease in the level of cobalt to the plateau
    corresponding to the bound component. The data confirmed the suitability of the
    washing method and proved high levels of bound cobalt in the hair of two patients
    requiring revision hip surgery. Moreover, the cobalt bound component was not affected
    by the neutron exposure of hair. As a result, the use of instrumental neutron
    activation analysis might be advantageous compared to other analytical techniques.</p>
