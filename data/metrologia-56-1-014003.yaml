abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present protocols for feedback control and stabilization
    of a single qubit undergoing Rabi oscillations. Using a hybrid quantum-classical
    Bayesian estimation technique we simulate monitoring of the dynamical parameter
    (Rabi frequency) of the governing Hamiltonian in real-time. We numerically demonstrate
    feedback control of the system parameter using a classical proportional-integral
    feedback control scheme and show that by implementing a unitary reversal of the
    back-action of the weak measurement the loop response time is dramatically reduced.
    This reversal is chosen by assuming the system is already executing the targeted
    dynamics, an approach called self-fulfilling prophecy. In addition, self-fulfilling
    prophecy reduces measurement induced noise, leading to stabilized dynamics.</p>
