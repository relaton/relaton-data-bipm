abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the field of interferometry for high-precision length measurements
    the influence of the refractive index of air can either be eliminated by completely
    measuring in a vacuum or by the application of a refractometer cell which enables
    the precise in situ determination of the refractivity. In the latter case, systematic
    effects can occur in connection with the operation of the refractometer cell due
    to mechanical stress induced at different pressures. Operation at a pressure range
    beyond the usual atmospheric pressure variation is needed when, for instance,
    the compressibility of a material measure is investigated or the pressure dependence
    of the refractive index of gases is aimed at. In this work an approach is shown
    for the correction of pressure-induced effects for the type of interference refractometer
    being used at PTB when starting from a reference state in vacuum. The required
    correction of the refractivity’s value was found to be of the order of  for a
    refractometer cell of 420 mm length which corresponds to a relative contribution
    of  when determining the air refractivity  at standard laboratory conditions.
    For instance, in the application of high-precision length measurements (up to
    1000 mm) the effect amounts to a length correction of several nanometers.</p>
