abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Recently several European National Measurement Institutes have
    established traceable calibration methods for dynamic mechanical quantities, e.g.
    dynamic force, torque and pressure. However, the use in industry and elsewhere
    of dynamic calibration information provided on certificates is not straightforward.
    Typically it is necessary to employ deconvolution techniques to obtain estimates
    of measurands, and the deconvolution method itself and the associated algorithms
    are sources of uncertainty that must be included in uncertainty budgets. There
    is a need for practical guidance for end users on how to use the newly-available
    dynamic calibration information. To this end we set out an approach to the evaluation
    of uncertainties associated with dynamic measurements that we believe covers the
    most relevant cases. The methods have been embodied in publicly-available software
    and we show how they can be used to tackle some example problems. We believe that
    the methods lead to more reliable estimates of the relevant measurands and their
    associated uncertainties.</p>
