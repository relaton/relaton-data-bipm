abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Salinity is an essential quantity to calculate many of the physical
    properties of oceans, but it is also a quantity hard to define considering the
    complexity of this material in its bio-geo-chemical composition and the imperfections
    of the existing measurement techniques. The TEOS-10 gives several definitions
    to the notion of absolute salinity, usable in the function of the properties to
    study, but they are based on the concept of a constant elemental composition of
    seawater, so that, if its major inorganic components are well known, its real
    composition varies in time and space and its determination is still a challenge.</p><p>Most
    salinity calculations are based on conductivity measurements. This publication
    reviews other techniques which are used or could be used to assess the absolute
    salinity of seawater and questions the measurand of these techniques and the possibility
    to redefine the concept of salinity from physical properties.</p>
