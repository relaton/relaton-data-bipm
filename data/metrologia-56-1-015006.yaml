abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the evaluation of the performance of optical time
    transfer links connecting a facility of Deutsche Telekom in Bremen with the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig. In the current configuration three links have been
    established, two via a hub in Hannover and one using an independent alternate
    route. They are equipped with electronically stabilized fiber optic time and frequency
    transfer systems and parallel operation is maintained since December 2016. A novel
    method of link calibration, composed of two steps (one performed in the laboratory
    and the second one in the field), to accurately determine the influence of fiber
    chromatic dispersion is discussed in detail, and a thorough analysis of the uncertainty
    budget is given. We show that the time transfer performance achieved is difficult
    to characterize based on measurements with time interval counters that are the
    standard equipment in timing laboratories and in the telecommunications sector.
    In our experiments, values of TDEV at the low ps-level at averaging times between
    10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> s have been achieved. The uncertainty of time
    transfer (including all kinds of delays) is of the order of 50 ps in a cascade
    of links. The results obtained show that such a kind of link is capable to deliver
    signals to a remote end with an instability being at least two orders of magnitude
    below the current requirements included in relevant Recommendations of the International
    Telecommunication Union—Telecommunication Sector (ITU-T). Moreover, the current
    implementation would allow primary Cs fountain clocks to be compared at the level
    of their performance, that is characterized by an uncertainty at the low 10<sup>−16</sup>
    level and a frequency instability of the same order of magnitude at 1 d averaging.</p>
