abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To develop a 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> hydrogen chloride (HCl)
    primary standard gas mixture in a high-pressure cylinder, pure HCl gas was diluted
    in two or three steps with pure N<sub>2</sub> in high-pressure aluminum and nickel-coated
    manganese steel cylinders. To check the consistency between the HCl gas mixtures
    in the different cylinders, the HCl mixing ratios were analyzed by Fourier transform
    infrared spectroscopy. Four cylinders of 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> HCl gas mixtures
    agreed within 0.2 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. A previous study showed that 0.29 μmol
    mol<sup>−1</sup> of HCl was adsorbed on the inner surface of aluminum cylinders
    that contained 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> HCl gas mixtures. The long-term stability
    test showed that the 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> HCl gas mixture in the aluminum
    cylinder decreased by 0.8 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> over 2 years, whereas that in
    the nickel-coated manganese steel cylinder decreased by 6 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>.
    This result suggested that the nickel-coated manganese steel cylinder is not suitable
    for developing 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> HCl gas mixtures. From the verification
    test between gas cylinders and the long-term stability test, the 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>
    HCl standard gas mixture in the aluminum cylinder was successfully developed with
    an expanded uncertainty of 1.65 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> (k  =  2%, 95% confidence
    level). The 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> HCl standard gas mixture was validated using
    an online ion chromatograph with a liquid Cl<sup>−</sup> certified reference material
    (CRM). The HCl gas mixture agreed with the liquid Cl<sup>−</sup> CRM within an
    expanded uncertainty of 1.5%.</p>
