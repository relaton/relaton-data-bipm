abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>It is widely recognized that the Mercury triple point (MTP)
    being situated very close to the Water triple point (WTP) constitutes a weakness
    in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), in addition to safety
    concerns related to the use and transportation of Mercury. As such, a substitution
    for a safer, high-quality fixed point about half way between the Argon and Water
    triple points would be highly desirable. Now, a direct comparison is described
    of a Xenon cell filled in 2005 by the National Research Council Canada (NRC) and
    a more recently produced cell of the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica
    (INRIM). The present paper discusses the INRiM 2017 measurements on both the INRiM
    and NRC cells, with a follow-up measurement at NRC, and presents the difference
    between the two cells, (0.17  ±  0.08) mK with the uncertainties of each cell’s
    realization of the Xenon triple point (XeTP), 0.11 mK for the INRiM cell and 0.07
    mK for the NRC cell (k  =  1). In addition, the effect of substituting Mercury
    with Xenon on Type 1 non-uniqueness (‘SRI’, subrange inconsistency), Type 3 non-uniqueness
    (‘NU3’, cSPRT variability) and propagation of fixed point realization uncertainty
    is shown and discussed.</p>
