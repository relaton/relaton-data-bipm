abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Light sources are typically assumed to be monochromatic when
    these are used for length measurements by interferometry, especially for the primary
    realization of the length. From the calibrated frequency of the light source,
    the (vacuum-) wavelength can be calculated which is generally assumed to be identical
    with the path length which corresponds to a single interference order (). While
    this assumption is correct for an ideal interference of two plane waves, it does
    not hold when the light is not perfectly monochromatic. This paper demonstrates
    that a certain amount of ‘parasitic light’, originating from an unwanted mode
    of a laser’s resonator, can lead to a relative error in the order of 10<sup>−7</sup>
    in a length measurement although the light frequency of the main mode was calibrated
    on a relative level of 10<sup>−12</sup>. The theoretical concept comprising a
    four-beam interference was confirmed experimentally by comparative length measurements
    in vacuum. Moreover, for a single parasitic light mode it was demonstrated that
    the maximum effect onto a length measurement is approximately given by interference
    orders, in which is the ratio between the intensity of the main light mode with
    respect to that of the parasitic light mode. As a conclusion it seems necessary
    to formulate additional requirements for light sources to be used in length measurements
    by interferometry, especially when these are intended to be used for the primary
    realization of the length.</p>
