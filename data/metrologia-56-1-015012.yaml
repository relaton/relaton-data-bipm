abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A detailed analysis of the uncertainties obtained in ac–dc difference
    measurements with an AC Josephson voltage standard (ACJVS) is presented. For audio
    frequencies and for voltages less than 200 mV, ac–dc transfers with the ACJVS
    may reduce the combined uncertainty by factors of 2–10, compared with conventional
    methods based on thermal converters. Type A uncertainties are predominantly limited
    by the thermal transfer standard (TTS), or the digital voltmeter used to acquire
    the output voltage from the TTS. In agreement with earlier work, the transmission
    line is the primary contributor to Type B errors for frequencies above 10 kHz.
    A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis is used to demonstrate how the uncertainties
    of transmission line impedance and on-chip inductance impact the accuracy of the
    rms amplitude conveyed to the TTS.</p>
