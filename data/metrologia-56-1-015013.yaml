abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The leakage flow rate represents an important input quantity
    in the measurement model for the gas flow rate in a clearance-sealed piston prover,
    especially when measuring small flow rates. This study deals with the experimental
    identification of leakage flow effects. The following influences were examined:
    the flow rate supplied to the piston prover, the inclination of the flow cell,
    the type of gas and the temperature of the gas. The leakage flow rate was measured
    during the typical operation of the piston prover using the dynamic summation
    method. The tests were carried out in a climate chamber to ensure stable and homogenous
    temperature conditions. It is demonstrated that the leakage flow rate is significantly
    affected by the piston prover’s inclination and the viscosity of the gas, which
    depends mainly on the type and the temperature of the gas. Based on the experimental
    findings that confirm the leakage flow rate is inversely proportional to the gas
    viscosity, a correction model was proposed. The uncertainty analysis shows that
    reproducibility is the most important component in the combined uncertainty of
    the leakage flow rate.</p>'
