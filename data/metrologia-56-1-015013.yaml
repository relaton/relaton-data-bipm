    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The leakage flow rate represents an important input quantity in the measurement model for the gas flow rate in a clearance-sealed piston prover, especially when measuring small flow rates. This study deals with the experimental identification of leakage flow effects. The following influences were examined: the flow rate supplied to the piston prover, the inclination of the flow cell, the type of gas and the temperature of the gas. The leakage flow rate was measured during the typical operation of the piston prover using the dynamic summation method. The tests were carried out in a climate chamber to ensure stable and homogenous temperature conditions. It is demonstrated that the leakage flow rate is significantly affected by the piston prover’s inclination and the viscosity of the gas, which depends mainly on the type and the temperature of the gas. Based on the experimental findings that confirm the leakage flow rate is inversely proportional to the gas viscosity, a correction model was proposed. The uncertainty analysis shows that reproducibility is the most important component in the combined uncertainty of the leakage flow rate.</p>
