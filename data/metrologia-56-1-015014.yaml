abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The uncertainty for calibrating M and G resistors using the
    NPL high-resistance CCC bridge has been re-evaluated, resulting in combined uncertainties
    of  ∼, considerably smaller than the CMC entries of and respectively. This re-evaluation
    supports measurement of single electron pump currents with combined uncertainties
    of a few parts in.</p>
