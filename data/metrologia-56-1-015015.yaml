abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Relative fugacity (RF), or relative activity, of water in humid
    air has recently been suggested as a real-gas generalisation for relative humidity,
    the latter being conventionally defined as a ratio of partial pressures of water
    vapour. The RF definition covers the entire temperature-pressure region below
    the critical point of water, where humid air remains a gas, in an unambiguous
    and continuous manner. However, while thermodynamically rigorous, the theoretical
    definition of RF does not provide experimental methods of measuring RF of given
    samples of humid air, nor of preparing reference materials of specified RF, such
    as for humidity-sensor calibration purposes. In this paper, the osmotic pressure
    of humid air with respect to pure water in different phases, mutually separated
    by a semi-permeable membrane, is proposed as an SI-traceable measurand for the
    calculation of RF over the full range of sub-saturated states. The method of osmotic
    pressures offers a theoretical option for the experimental determination of the
    RF of humid-air samples without use or knowledge required on their actual or saturation
    composition, without exploiting an empirical equation for the fugacity, or an
    equation of state of humid air.</p>
