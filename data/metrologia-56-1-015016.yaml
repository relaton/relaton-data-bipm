abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This work reports on the pilot study, performed by INRIM, NPL
    and PTB, on the measurement of the parameter in the visible spectral range of
    a test single-photon source based on a colour centre in diamond. The development
    of single-photon sources is of high interest to the metrology community as well
    as the burgeoning quantum technologies industry. Measurement of the parameter
    plays a vital role in characterising and understanding single-photon emission.
    This comparison has been conducted by each partner individually using their own
    equipment at INRIM laboratories, which were responsible for the operation of the
    source.</p>
