    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p><sup>252</sup>Cf neutron sources are particularly convenient, and therefore widely used, to characterize and calibrate many kinds of neutron detectors for both scientific and technological applications. An emerging interest is the use of <sup>252</sup>Cf to calibrate neutron correlation counters for the verification and assay of Pu-items as part of the international effort to safeguard nuclear materials. Passive neutron correlation counting (PNCC) methods, combined with knowledge of the fission neutron multiplicity distribution, can be used as an absolute technique to determine the neutron emission rate of <sup>252</sup>Cf sources. This means that common equipment used by the safeguards community can, in principle, be used to self-certify, to high accuracy, the strength of physically small <sup>252</sup>Cf sealed sources for use in calibration. This is the first step in using <sup>252</sup>Cf in place of extensive Pu reference materials for experimental calibration by the safeguards community. The theoretical foundation is already clear but the present work presents the first systematic attempt at demonstrating the practical utility of the concept across a variety of typical instruments. We compare four emission rate estimators for four detector configurations on a common source previously certified by the MnSO<sub>4</sub>-bath technique. We find that the estimator based on the singles to doubles rate ratio provides consistent and precise results across all of the instruments and that these agree with the MnSO<sub>4</sub>-bath technique within combined uncertainties. This success suggests that the absolute PNCC method could become a technically defensible and commonly used, method capable of sub 1% accuracy for routine calibration work.</p>
