abstract:
- content: Abstract<p><sup>252</sup>Cf neutron sources are particularly convenient,
    and therefore widely used, to characterize and calibrate many kinds of neutron
    detectors for both scientific and technological applications. An emerging interest
    is the use of<sup>252</sup>Cf to calibrate neutron correlation counters for the
    verification and assay of Pu-items as part of the international effort to safeguard
    nuclear materials. Passive neutron correlation counting (PNCC) methods, combined
    with knowledge of the fission neutron multiplicity distribution, can be used as
    an absolute technique to determine the neutron emission rate of<sup>252</sup>Cf
    sources. This means that common equipment used by the safeguards community can,
    in principle, be used to self-certify, to high accuracy, the strength of physically
    small<sup>252</sup>Cf sealed sources for use in calibration. This is the first
    step in using<sup>252</sup>Cf in place of extensive Pu reference materials for
    experimental calibration by the safeguards community. The theoretical foundation
    is already clear but the present work presents the first systematic attempt at
    demonstrating the practical utility of the concept across a variety of typical
    instruments. We compare four emission rate estimators for four detector configurations
    on a common source previously certified by the MnSO<sub>4</sub>-bath technique.
    We find that the estimator based on the singles to doubles rate ratio provides
    consistent and precise results across all of the instruments and that these agree
    with the MnSO<sub>4</sub>-bath technique within combined uncertainties. This success
    suggests that the absolute PNCC method could become a technically defensible and
    commonly used, method capable of sub 1% accuracy for routine calibration work.</p>
