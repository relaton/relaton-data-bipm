abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Determination of the thermal properties of a material is an
    important task in many scientific and engineering applications. How a material
    behaves when subjected to high or fluctuating temperatures can be critical to
    the safety and longevity of a systemâ€™s essential components. The laser flash experiment
    is a well-established technique for indirectly measuring the thermal diffusivity,
    and hence the thermal conductivity, of a material. In previous works, optimization
    schemes have been used to find estimates of the thermal conductivity and other
    quantities of interest which best fit a given model to experimental data. Adopting
    a Bayesian approach allows for prior beliefs about uncertain model inputs to be
    conditioned on experimental data to determine a posterior distribution, but probing
    this distribution using sampling techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
    can be incredibly computationally intensive. This difficulty is especially true
    for forward models consisting of time-dependent partial differential equations.
    We pose the problem of determining the thermal conductivity of a material via
    the laser flash experiment as a Bayesian inverse problem in which the laser intensity
    is also treated as uncertain. We introduce a parametric surrogate model that takes
    the form of a stochastic Galerkin finite element approximation, also known as
    a generalized polynomial chaos expansion, and show how it can be used to sample
    efficiently from the approximate posterior distribution. This approach gives access
    not only to the sought-after estimate of the thermal conductivity but also important
    information about its relationship to the laser intensity, and information for
    uncertainty quantification. Moreover, this approach leads to significant speed
    up over traditional methods by orders of magnitude. We also investigate the effects
    of the spatial profile of the laser on the estimated posterior distribution for
    the thermal conductivity.</p>
