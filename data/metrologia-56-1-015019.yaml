abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Estimating the probability density function (pdf) from a limited
    sample of data is a challenging data analysis problem. Furthermore, determining
    which pdf best describes the available data involves an extra layer of complexity
    to the analysis, which if ignored, can have considerable consequences.</p><p>We
    propose a combined maximum entropy (MaxEnt) moments and Bayesian model selection
    method to address this problem. The MaxEnt moments component is used to formulate
    a set of possible pdf models, each constrained by a different set of moments and
    parameterised by a set of Lagrangian multipliers. The Bayesian model selection
    component makes an inference about the most probable model, from the set of MaxEnt
    moment models. The structure of the prior pdf for the Lagrangian multipliers is
    determined from an expansion of the free energy functional for each MaxEnt model,
    and corresponding hyperparameters are calculated empirically.</p><p>Numerical
    experiments were used to test the proposed method on samples taken from Gaussian
    and (more complex) non-Gaussian distributions, over a range of sample sizes. The
    results clearly demonstrate that the method can discriminate between simple and
    complex MaxEnt models for sample sizes approximately greater than 60. Our results
    demonstrate that MaxEnt and Bayesian methods are complementary. More critically,
    Bayesian inference is necessary when a set of competing MaxEnt models can be derived
    for a single dataset from a range of assumptions.</p>
