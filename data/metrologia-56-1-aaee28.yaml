abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Demand for calibration at infrasonic frequencies has emerged
    in response to earth monitoring problems. The primary standard for sound pressure
    is defined through the reciprocity calibration method specified in the International
    Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 61094-2:2009. This method is based
    on the use of closed couplers and is routinely applied by the National Metrology
    Institutes for a large frequency range; however, infrasonic frequencies below
    2 Hz have not been explored until recently. The acoustic transfer admittance of
    the coupler, including the heat conduction effects of the fluid, must be modelled
    precisely to obtain accurate microphone sensitivity. IEC 61094-2:2009 provides
    two standardised solutions for the correction of heat conduction. However, researchers
    have noted significant deviations between these corrections at low frequencies
    in plane wave couplers, indicating that one or both techniques incorrectly calculate
    the influence of heat conduction. In this paper, the limitations of the standardised
    formulations at infrasonic frequencies are identified and two alternative solutions
    are proposed. An experiment is also reported, which highlights the discussed limitations
    of the standardised formulations for acoustic transfer admittance, while also
    demonstrating the validity of the proposed alternative formulations at frequencies
    down to 0.04 Hz.</p>
