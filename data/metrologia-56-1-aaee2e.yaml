abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The traceable optical measurement of spatial angles is taking
    on an increasingly important role in the modern form measurement of high quality
    optical surfaces. In many cases, autocollimators are utilised to measure the local
    tilt of a surface in two perpendicular directions. Autocollimators have up to
    now been traceably calibrated using plane angle standards like sine bars or divided
    circles. Here we present recent advances of the spatial angle autocollimator calibrator
    (SAAC) of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). The SAAC consists of
    an innovative Cartesian arrangement of three autocollimators facing a central
    reflector cube. This arrangement effectively divides the spatial angle measurement
    of the autocollimator to be calibrated into two separate measurements of plane
    angles of the two reference autocollimators. The reference autocollimators serve
    as transfer standards and are traceably calibrated by using the WMT 220, which
    is the primary plane angle standard of PTB.</p><p>We present an optimised mathematical
    model of the SAAC which features an approximation-free description obtained by
    using a minimal set of parameters. The model is used for the in situ determination
    and correction of the alignment errors of the opto-mechanical components.</p><p>The
    uncertainty of an autocollimator calibration when using the SAAC is evaluated
    by means of the Monte Carlo approach. The uncertainty of the calibration of the
    reference autocollimators is the dominant contribution. In addition, we present
    an experimental validation of the model and of the uncertainty budget using an
    error separation technique.</p>
