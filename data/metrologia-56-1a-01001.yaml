- content: |-
    <p></p><p>In 2017 the Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM) commissioned a key comparison of electrical capacitance standards, the second time this quantity has been compared since the implementation of the Mutual Recognition Agreement by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM—MRA) in 1999. This comparison—CCEM-K4.2017—was piloted by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and included seven National Metrology Institutes (NMI) belonging to four Regional Metrology Organizations.</p><p>The measuring scheme adopted for the comparison was that of a star comparison consisting of a set of bilateral comparisons between the participating NMIs and the BIPM, whose capacitance reference base served as a common reference. For each of the bilateral comparisons, the measurands were the capacitance values of 10 pF travelling standard capacitors belonging to the NMIs and, optionally, the values of 100 pF standards.</p><p>All the participants have been chosen from those able to realize and maintain a representation of the farad at the best known level of accuracy. Four of them, including the BIPM, were taking their traceability from dc or ac quantum Hall effect standards and, the four others, from a calculable capacitor.</p><p>The comparison results analysis have evidenced an agreement within about ±5 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> for the mandatory 10 pF measurements and within about ±10 parts in 10<sup>8</sup> for the optional 100 pF measurements. Also, excepted for one of the participants, a good agreement has been found for the ratio 100 pF:10 pF (within ±5 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>).</p><p>In addition to the comparison, it has been possible to evaluate the difference between the value of R<sub>K</sub> (von Klitzing constant) measured by electrical means from calculable capacitors and its last CODATA recommended value (CODATA 2014 adjustment). A difference of (43 ± 23) parts in 10<sup>9</sup> (k = 1) has been found which is consistent with the difference that can be computed from the experimental data used in the CODATA 2014 adjustment of fundamental constants.</p><p>This report presents the details of the measurements and analysis having led to these results.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
