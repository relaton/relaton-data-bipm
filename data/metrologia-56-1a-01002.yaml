    <p></p><p>The ongoing on-site comparison BIPM.EM-K12 is part of the BIPM programme implemented to verify the international coherence of the primary resistance standards. It allows National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) to validate their implementations of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) for dc resistance traceability by comparison to the reference maintained at the BIPM.</p><p>In this comparison, the realization of the ohm from the QHE-based standard of the NMIs at 100 Ω is compared with that realized by the BIPM from its own transportable quantum Hall resistance standard. This comparison is completed by scaling measurements from 100 Ω to 1 Ω and 10 kΩ through the measurement of the resistance ratios 100 Ω/1 Ω and 10 kΩ/100 Ω, respectively.</p><p>In June 2018 a new BIPM.EM-K12 on-site comparison was carried out at the National Research Council Canada (NRC-CNRC). It was the first time the NRC-CNRC participated in this comparison program.</p><p>Measurements of the 100 Ω transfer standard in terms of the conventional value of the von Klitzing constant, RK-90, agreed to 5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with a relative combined standard uncertainty  u<sub>c</sub> = 23 × 10<sup>-10</sup>. Measurements of 10 kΩ/100 Ω and 100 Ω/1 Ω ratios agreed to 13 parts in 10<sup>10</sup> with  u<sub>c</sub> = 21 × 10<sup>-10</sup> and to 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup> with  u<sub>c</sub> = 40 × 10<sup>-10</sup>, respectively.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Quantum Hall Effect, key comparison, resistance standard, resistance ratio</p><p></p><p> Main text</p><p>
