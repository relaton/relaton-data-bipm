    <p>A supplementary comparison of two fixed attenuators (3 dB HP 8491B and 20 dB HP 8491B) for RF attenuation and two mismatched loads (Maury 2562C and Maury 2561A) for voltage reflection coefficient was carried out between three AFRIMETS members namely NMISA (South Africa, the pilot laboratory), DEFNAT (Tunisia) and NIS (Egypt). The motivation for the comparison was to verify the consistency and equivalence of RF attenuation and reflection measurements between the participants. The agreement between the participants' measurements was good as evidenced by the normalised error, which was less than unity for all the specified frequency points for both the attenuation measurements and voltage reflection coefficient measurements.</p>
