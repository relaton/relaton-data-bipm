  content: "<p></p>\n<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.b,
    a comparison of the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National
    Standards Authority of Ireland - National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI - NML), Dublin,
    Ireland, was carried out in May and June 2018. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling
    standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_E (ZE) and BIPM_F (ZF), were transported by freight
    to NSAI-NML. At NSAI-NML, the reference standard for DC voltage at the 10 V level
    consists of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic voltage standards.
    The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured
    by direct comparison with the group standard.</p>\n<p>At the BIPM the travelling
    standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at NSAI-NML, with
    the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for
    the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature
    and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p>\n<p>The final result of the comparison is
    presented as the difference between the value assigned to DC voltage standard
    by NSAI-NML, at the level of 10 V, at NSAI-NML, <italic toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n
    \              <sub>NML</sub>, and that assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n               <sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference dates
    of 20 May 2018.</p>\n<p>\n               <italic toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n               <sub>NML</sub>

    10 V</p>\n<p>where <italic toggle=\"yes\">u</italic>\n               <sub>c</sub>
    is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference,
    including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM, at NSAI-NML,
    and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p>\n<p>The comparison result is
    within the claimed uncertainties despite the fact that one of the NSAI NML results
    (for standard ZF) differed from the BIPM value by -1.66 μV.</p>\n<p>The voltage
    standards maintained by NSAI-NML and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated
    standard uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p>\n<p>KEY WORDS
