abstract:
- content: "<p></p><p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.b, a
    comparison of the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National
    Standards Authority of Ireland - National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI - NML), Dublin,
    Ireland, was carried out in May and June 2018. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling
    standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_E (ZE) and BIPM_F (ZF), were transported by freight
    to NSAI-NML. At NSAI-NML, the reference standard for DC voltage at the 10 V level
    consists of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic voltage standards.
    The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured
    by direct comparison with the group standard.</p><p>At the BIPM the travelling
    standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at NSAI-NML, with
    the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for
    the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature
    and ambient atmospheric pressure.</p><p>The final result of the comparison is
    presented as the difference between the value assigned to DC voltage standard
    by NSAI-NML, at the level of 10 V, at NSAI-NML, U<sub>NML</sub>, and that assigned
    by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference dates of 20 May 2018.</p><p>\n
    \              U<sub>NML</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = - 1.21 μV, \tu<sub>c</sub>
    = 1.38 μV,   at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty
    associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation
    of the volt at the BIPM, at NSAI-NML, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>The
    comparison result is within the claimed uncertainties despite the fact that one
    of the NSAI NML results (for standard ZF) differed from the BIPM value by -1.66
    μV.</p><p>The voltage standards maintained by NSAI-NML and the BIPM were equivalent,
    within their stated standard uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.</p><p>KEY
