    <p></p><p>From April to June 2018, a bilateral comparison of energy standards at 50/60 Hz was conducted by SIM and AFRIMET.</p><p>The comparison includes measurements of active energy at two frequencies and power factors 1.0 and 0.5 lead/lag. Aiming to evaluate the stated uncertainty and degrees of equivalence between CENAMEP AIP-Panamá and NIS-Egypt.</p><p>This work presents the results of the SIM.EM-S14 supplementary comparison.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Active Energy, Power Factor, Normalized Error</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
