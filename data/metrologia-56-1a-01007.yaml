    <p></p><p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance between the NPLI (India) and the BIPM carried out in 2012-2013. Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements. The standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about three months, then for a period of about two months at the NPLI, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13.b (for 10 kΩ).</p><p>The results from the NPLI and the BIPM were found to be in agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence, k = 2) of 0.52 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 1 Ω and 0.28 × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Resistance; ohm; CIPM MRA; comparison; K13; electricity</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
