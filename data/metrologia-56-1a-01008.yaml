    <p></p><p>The Supplementary Comparison COOMET.EM-S20 was carried out to allow for a clear and unequivocal comparison of the measurement results and shows the equivalence of measurement results obtained with the measurement systems for voltage in the participating national metrology institutes.</p><p>COOMET.EM-S20 was conducted within the Regional Metrology Organization (ROM) "Euro-Asian Cooperation of National Metrological Institutions" known as COOMET, and has the RMO project number of 686/MD-a/16.</p><p>Two NMIs from two ROMs (COOMET and EURAMET) participated in the comparison which is: PTB, Germany (link laboratory) and INM-MD, Moldova (pilot laboratory).</p><p>This report describes the measurement results of the DC voltages of the four plug-ins at 1,018 V and 10 V.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>DC voltage, voltage standard, measurement capabilities</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
