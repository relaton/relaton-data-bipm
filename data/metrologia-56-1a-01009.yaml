    <p></p><p>A key comparison of DC voltage at 10 V and 1.018 V has been conducted from 2013 to 2014 between NMIJ, CMS and KRISS. In this comparison, PJVS systems were compared via Zener travelling standards. All the results agree well to the key comparison reference values, which are provided by a conventional JVS system at KRISS, within 1 part in 10<sup>7</sup> for 10 V and 2 parts in 10<sup>7</sup> for 1.018 V, respectively.</p><p> Main text</p><p>
