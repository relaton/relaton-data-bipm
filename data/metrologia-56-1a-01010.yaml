- content: |-
    <p></p><p>An intercomparison for electrical standards of low-frequency 50 Hz/60 Hz power has taken place within the framework of COOMET. The intercomparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'-UMTS (Ukraine), has involved thirteen laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization: EURAMET, APMP, GULFMET, and AFRIMETS. NIM (China) and VNIIM (Russia) are linking NMIs as far as they participated in CCEM-K5. The results presented in this report appear to show that there are significant differences between some laboratories' representations of the watt. However, the agreement demonstrated by the intercomparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for the power at 50 Hz and 53 Hz for 1.0, 0.5 Lag, 0.5 Lead, 0.0 Lag, 0.0 Lead power factors.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
