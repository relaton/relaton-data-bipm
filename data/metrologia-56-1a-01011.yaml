    <p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance between the NIM (The People's Republic of China) and the BIPM carried out at the end of 2018, beginning of 2019. Two 1 Ω  and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a period of one month at the NIM, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13.b (for 10 kΩ).</p>
    <p>The results from the NIM and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainties (95% confidence, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) for both 1 Ω and 10 kΩ standards. Relative differences are + 0.010 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for 1 Ω and − 0.001 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for 10 kΩ with a relative expanded uncertainty of 0.034 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for 1 Ω and 0.032 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p>
