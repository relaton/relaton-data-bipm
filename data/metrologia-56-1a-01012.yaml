    <p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison between the SMD, Belgium, and the BIPM, which was carried out using two 10 pF and two 100 pF travelling standards belonging to the BIPM following an "A-B-A" pattern. The comparison at 10 pF forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a and that at 100 pF of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b, where BIPM is the pilot laboratory for both of these comparisons.</p>
    <p>The standards were measured during a total time of 18 weeks, from August 2018 to December 2018. The measurand of this comparison was the two terminal-pair capacitance of the travelling capacitors at a frequency of 1000 Hz, and a measuring rms voltage of 15 V.</p>
    <p>The results from the SMD and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, within a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty of the comparison.</p>
