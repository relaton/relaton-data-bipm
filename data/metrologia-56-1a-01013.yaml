    <p></p><p>An intercomparison of inductance at 10 mH and 100 mH at 1 kHz has taken place within the framework of GULFMET. The intercomparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'-UMTS (Ukraine), has involved three laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization-COOMET (UMTS, Ukraine). The results presented in this report appear to show that there are significant differences between some laboratories' representations of the henry. However, the agreement demonstrated by the intercomparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for the inductance at 10 mH and 100 mH.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Intercomparison, inductance, traceability, regional metrological organization</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
