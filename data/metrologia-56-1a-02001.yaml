    <p></p><p>The Laboratoire National de Métrologie et d'Essais, LNE-CNAM (France) and The National Institute of Metrology, RCM LIPI (Indonesia) agreed in December 2013 to conduct a bilateral comparison on luminous flux using a group of lamps as transfer standards.</p><p>The aims of the comparison were:</p><p>• To link the RCM LIPI realized lumen to the CCPR K4 reference value</p><p>• To demonstrate the RCM LIPI capability in calibrating tungsten standards lamps.</p><p>The comparison and its protocol were approved by the CCPR and registered with KCDB with the comparison number: EURAMET.PR-K4.2.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Luminous flux, PR K4, Bilateral Comparison</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
