    <p>The Supplementary Comparison COOMET.PR-S2 was carried out to ensure the correctness and comparability of angle of rotation of plane of polarization measured by the Participants of the comparison within the uncertainties claimed for their measuring facility.</p>
    <p>COOMET.PR-S2 was conducted within the Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) "Euro-Asian Cooperation of National Metrological Institutions" known as COOMET and has the RMO project number of 438/RU/08.</p>
    <p>The Comparison was piloted by the All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI). Four NMIs from two RMOs (COOMET and EURAMET) participated in the comparison.</p>
    <p>This report describes the measurement results of three quartz control plates (QCP) with different value of optical rotations at the wavelength of He-Ne laser (632.8 nm).</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
    <p>Polarimetry, angle of rotation of plane of polarization, quartz control plates, optical rotation</p>
