    <p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of luminous flux between the Instituto de Óptica, IO-CSIC (Spain) and the Ulusal Metroloji Enstitüsü, TUBITAK UME (Turkey). This bilateral comparison is intended to link the TUBITAK UME realized lumen to the CCPR K4 reference value. The measurement artefacts were specially developed transfer standard lamps for luminous flux of the Polaron LF200W type.</p>
    <p>The comparison and its protocol were approved by the CCPR and registered with KCDB with the comparison number: EURAMET.PR-K4.3.</p>
