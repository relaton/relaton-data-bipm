    <p></p><p>A bilateral comparison of the spectral irradiance in wavelengths range from 200 nm to 350 nm was carried out between VNIIOFI (Russia) and PTB (Germany) using 30W deuterium lamps as artefacts. The purpose of the comparison is to provide VNIIOFI a link to the results of the key comparison CCPR-K1.b. PTB was a link laboratory, but VNIIOFI served as a pilot. The degree of equivalence (DoE) of VNIIOFI, i.e. the difference of spectral irradiance values measured by VNIIOFI from the key comparison reference value (KCRV), varied from -2.5 % to 1.6 % and was within the standard uncertainty.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
