    <p>The COOMET.T-K3-3 comparison is the regional comparison of ITS-90 fixed point realizations in the range from the triple point of water to the freezing point of aluminum. Six national metrology institutes: VNIIM (Russian Federation), BelGIM (Belarus), NSC IM (Ukraina), KazInMetr (Kazakhstan), NIM (Republic of Moldova), GEOSTM (Georgia) participated in this regional COOMET comparison. VNIIM was appointed as the pilot laboratory and the coordinator of the comparison. The link between the regional and key comparisons was provided by VNIIM.</p>
    <p>Two standard platinum resistance thermometers (25 ohm), manufactured at VNIIM, was used as a transfer standards.</p>
    <p>The degree of equivalence of measurement standards of the national metrology institutes participating in the COOMET comparison is determinated relative to the reference values of the CCT-K3 through the measurement results received by VNIIM, which took part in comparison. The report presents the results of this comparison and gives detailed information about the method of estimation of the degree of equivalence of NMI standards and its uncertainties.</p>
    <p>The comparison results have confirmed the uncertainty values, claimed by NMIs</p>
