    <p>An International Comparison on the calibration of noble metal thermocouples from 419 °C up to 1100 °C has been carried out among the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of Spain, FYR Macedonia and Chile. Measurements were performed from March 2016 to June 2017. One type R thermocouple circulated between the participants that was calibrated by using fixed points or by comparison, depending of the capabilities of the laboratories. The Centro Español de Metrología (Spanish NMI), CEM, acted as the pilot laboratory providing the reference value of the comparison.</p>
    <p>The thermocouple shown an acceptable behavior throughout the comparison, with no critical deterioration of its homogeneity and a maximum drift lower than 2 μV in the worst case. The results of the comparison were quite satisfactory. The three institutes are compatible with a coverage factor <italic toggle="yes">k</italic>= 2 in all the calibration points and in the case of aluminum and zinc they are even compatible for a coverage factor <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 1.</p>
    <p>This report presents the results of this comparison and provides detailed information of the measurements performed by the participating laboratories.</p>
