    <p></p><p>The COOMET.T-S2 comparison is a regional comparison in which the national metrological institutes of Moldova, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey participate.</p><p>Two standard platinum resistance thermometers (100 ohm), manufactured at VNIIM, was used as a transfer standards. National Metrology Institute (NMI) of Republic of Moldova is a pilot laboratory in this comparison.</p><p>The purpose of the comparisons is to verify equivalence between the participating laboratories in the calibration of industrial platinum resistance thermometers by direct comparison in the range from minus 40 °C to 420 °C. The comparison results are used to confirm the calibration and measurement capabilities in this range.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
