    <p>This Bilateral Comparison of gauge blocks calibration by interferometry was held in 2017. The gauge blocks measured in the comparison, are short (2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, 50 mm, 80 mm and 100 mm) and long gauge blocks (200 mm, 500 mm and 600 mm).</p>
    <p>The blocks were inspected and illustrated prior and after the comparison according to the stability. The degree of equivalence is calculated for each of the gauge blocks and the results show that there is a degree of equivalence within 1. The latest comparison, which UME had participated, is EURAMET.L-K1.2011, calibration of short and long gage blocks by interferometry. Since GULFMET is a new RMO, this comparison can provide a link to the EURAMET key comparison.</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
