    <p></p><p>The COOMET Project No 569/UA/12 "Comparison of length standards in the range of 0.001 to 1 mm", KCDB Reference COOMET.L-S14, was organized by TC 1.5 "Length and Angle" of COOMET. This comparison started in July 2015 and finished in August 2016. It was piloted by the National Scientific Center "Institute of Metrology", Kharkov, Ukraine with other participants as follows VNIIM (Russia), SKS RSE KazInMetr (Kazakhstan).</p><p>This supplementary comparison is carried out with the purpose of confirming calibration and measurement capabilities of the corresponding national metrology institutes of Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan.</p><p>Standard measuring instruments are taking part in comparison with the aim of providing validity of linear dimensions of measurements, of CMCs in the field of measurements of length.</p><p>The reference line gauge of comparison with a length of 1 mm scale is measured in the NSC "Institute of Metrology", thereafter it is successively delivered to all participants of comparison. After the measurement by the last participant, the reference line gauge is measured at the NSC "Institute of Metrology" for checking its stability.</p><p>By the end of comparison, the reference line gauge is not used for any other purposes except comparisons.</p><p>According to the results of the analysis provided by all participants of the data comparisons, the value of criterion χ<sup>2</sup> does not exceed the critical value (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>0.95</sub> = 5.99) for all measured intervals of the comparison measure, that is the objective confirmation of the announced uncertainties.</p><p>The comparison results help to support the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the laboratories involved in the CIPM MRA.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>reference line, interval length, deviation</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
