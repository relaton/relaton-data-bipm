    <p></p><p>The COOMET Project No 765/UA/18 (The bilateral comparison of length standards for measuring end measures in the range up from 0.5 mm to 100 mm), was organized by TC 1.5 (Length and Angle) of COOMET. This comparison started in December 2018 and finished in February 2019. Participants of the comparisons: the NSC "Institute of Metrology", Kharkov, Ukraine (pilot), and Department of Geometric Measurements Institute of Metrology GEOSTM, Tbilisi, Georgia.</p><p>These comparisons are supplementary bilateral. The purpose of the comparisons is to determine the equivalence of the measurement standards being compared.</p><p>Comparison participants should have the possibility to measure the end measures of lengths from steel with a nominal size of 1.28 mm; 70 mm; 100 mm by the mechanical method. Whatever measuring instruments are used by the participants of comparisons, they should be traceable to the measurement standard of meter.</p><p>For bilateral comparisons it is sufficient to establish a pairwise degree of equivalence, i.e. the difference in results between measurements and the corresponding expanded uncertainty with a coverage factor of 2 and a confidence level of 0.95. Calculations approve that discrepancies between the measurement results of deviations are significantly less than the expanded uncertainty, which confirms a good degree of equivalence of the measuring installations of NSC "Institute of Metrology" of Ukraine and YuLOP "Georgian National Agency for Standards and Metrology" (GEOSTM) Institute of Metrology.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>length, end measures of length, mechanical method, deviation</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
