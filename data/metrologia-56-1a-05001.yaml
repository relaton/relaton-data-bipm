    <p>In this bilateral comparison the pre-defined time intervals between two pulses have been measured by using both the high speed oscilloscope and the time interval counter. The pulses used in the measurements have been generated by a modified delay generator which is commercially available.</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
    <p>Time interval measurement, time interval comparison, delay generator</p>
