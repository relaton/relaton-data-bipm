    <p>A key comparison has been carried out of the absorbed dose to water standards of the Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS), Switzerland, and the BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 6.6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
