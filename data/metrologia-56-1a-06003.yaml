    <p></p><p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NPL, UK, and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 3.4 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>, with some evidence of a dependence on radiation quality. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Radiation dosimetry, air kerma, comparison, medium-energy x-rays</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
