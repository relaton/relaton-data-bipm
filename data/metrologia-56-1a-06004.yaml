    <p></p>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NPL, UK and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results indicate a progressive drift of the NPL standard, now lower than the BIPM standard by around 1 part in 10<sup>2</sup>. The expanded uncertainty (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) of the comparison is 4.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
