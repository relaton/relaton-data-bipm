    <p></p><p>A comparison of calculations of the activity of a<sup>3</sup>H2O liquid scintillation source using the same experimental data set collected at the LNE-LNHB with a triple-to-double coincidence ratio (TDCR) counter was completed. A total of 17 laboratories calculated the activity and standard uncertainty of the LS source, using the files with experimental data. The results, as well as relevant information on the computation techniques are presented and analysed in this paper. All results are compatible, even if there is a significant dispersion between the reported uncertainties. An output of this comparison is the estimation of the dispersion of TDCR measurement results when measurement conditions are well defined.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Radionuclide metrology, supplementary comparison, tritium, liquid scintillation</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
