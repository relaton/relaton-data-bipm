    <p></p><p>A key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), United Kingdom and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2017. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the NPL and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9996 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.0×10<sup>-3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Radiation dosimetry, air kerma, key comparison, Co-60 gamma radiation</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
