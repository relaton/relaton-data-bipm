    <p>In the Force Key Comparison CCM.F-K3 the measurand force was compared at the two force steps 500 kN and 1 MN. 12 laboratories participated in this comparison which was organised by PTB as the pilot laboratory in two laboratory groups (group A and B). In group A, the comparison was carried out with two 1 MN compression force transducers at the two force steps 500 kN and 1 MN (CCM.F-K3a) and with 6 participating laboratories. In group B, the comparison was carried out with two 500 kN compression force transducers at one force step of 500 kN (CCM.F-K3b) and with 9 participating laboratories. The key comparison reference values were determined as the weighted mean of all results for the two force steps and set to 500 kN and 1 MN, respectively, with the associated uncertainties. The degrees of equivalence were determined for all 12 laboratories for 500 kN compression force and for 6 laboratories for 1 MN compression force.</p>
