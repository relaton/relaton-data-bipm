    <p>This report gives the results of the APMP.M.F-K2.a and APMP.M.F-K2.b key comparison in 50 kN and 100 kN force range. This regional key comparison was conducted under the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) to establish a link to the global CCM.F-K2 (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/49/1A/07002/meta) key comparison.</p>
    <p>13 laboratories participated in this key comparison. The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) served as the pilot laboratory. The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST) and the National Metrology Institute (NIM) of China together with KRISS provided links to the CCM.F-K2.a and CCM.F-K2.b key comparison. Two pairs of force transducers of 50 kN and 100 kN nominal capacities were circulated among the participants in a star formation.</p>
    <p>The final results suggest that the nominal 50 kN force generated at one laboratory and 100 kN force at another laboratory may be different from the CCM.F-K2 key comparison reference value.</p>
