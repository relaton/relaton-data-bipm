    <p></p><p>This report gives the results of the APMP.M.F-K2.a and APMP.M.F-K2.b key comparison in 50 kN and 100 kN force range. This regional key comparison was conducted under the Asia Pacific Metrology Program (APMP) to establish a link to the global CCM.F-K2 (http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0026-1394/49/1A/07002/meta) key comparison.</p><p>13 laboratories participated in this key comparison. The Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) served as the pilot laboratory. The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ/AIST) and the National Metrology Institute (NIM) of China together with KRISS provided links to the CCM.F-K2.a and CCM.F-K2.b key comparison. Two pairs of force transducers of 50 kN and 100 kN nominal capacities were circulated among the participants in a star formation.</p><p>The final results suggest that the nominal 50 kN force generated at one laboratory and 100 kN force at another laboratory may be different from the CCM.F-K2 key comparison reference value.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Force, 50 kN, 100 kN, APMP</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
