    <p>Bilateral comparison of mass standards of 5 mg, 2 g, 50 g, 1 kg and 2 kg was carried out in 2017 between TÜBİTAK UME and SASO NMCC. TÜBİTAK UME was the pilot laboratory and the transfer standards were provided by TÜBİTAK UME. For all mass standards, the results show adequate agreement between the laboratories except 1 kg and 2 g.</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
