    <p>This report describes the results of a key comparison of pneumatic pressure standards between korea research institute of standards and science (KRISS) and national institute of metrology, china (NIM) in order to determine their degrees of equivalence at pressures in the range 0.4 mpa to 4 mpa in gauge pressure. This bilateral comparison was carried out from aug. 2012 to nov. 2012 within the framework of the asia pacific metrology programme (APMP). The pilot laboratory was kriss. The degrees of equivalence in this comparison were transferred to the corresponding cc key comparison, ccm.p-k1.c through the results of apmp.m.p-k1.c, in which kriss participated.</p>
    <p>Both of the participating institutes used pneumatic pressure balances as their pressure standards. The same piston-cylinder assembly (PCA) as one used for both pressure standards was used as a transfer standard (TS). The TS was calibrated at kriss before and after the measurement at nim. The difference was used for the characterization of TS.</p>
    <p>This reports shows that NIM results are equivalent to the CCM key comparison results within the claimed uncertainty.</p>
