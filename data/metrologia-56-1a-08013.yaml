    <p>CCQM key comparison K-153 Measurement of Specific Adsorption A [mol/kg] of N<sub>2</sub> and Kr on nonporous SiO<sub>2</sub> at LN temperature (to enable a traceable determination of the Specific Surface Area (BET) following ISO 9277) has been performed by the Surface Analysis Working Group (SAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM). The objective of this key comparison is to compare the equivalency of the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) for the measurement of specific adsorption, BET specific surface area) of nonporous substances (sorbents, ceramics, catalytic agents, etc) used in advanced technology.</p>
    <p>In this key comparison, a commercial nonporous silicon dioxide was supplied as a sample. Eight NMIs participated in this key comparison, but only five NMI's have reported in time. All participants used a gas adsorption method, here nitrogen and (or) krypton adsorption at 77.3 K, for analysis according to the international standards ISO 15901-2 and 9277.</p>
    <p>In this key comparison, the degrees of equivalence uncertainties for specific adsorption nitrogen and krypton, BET specific surface area were established.</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
