    <p>This article presents the report on the supplementary comparison COOMET.QM-S4, "C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>5</sub> components in mixtures of liquified hydrocarbons". The objective of this comparison was assessment of the analytical capabilities of COOMET NMIs for measuring the composition of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) mixtures when sampled in the liquid phase from Constant Pressure Cylinders (CPCs).</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
    <p>supplementary comparison, COOMET, Liquid Petroleum Gas, LPG, amount of substance fraction, constant pressure cylinders, ethane, propane, propene, i-butane, n-butane, 1-butene, i-pentane</p>
