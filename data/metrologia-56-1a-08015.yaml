    <p></p><p>The 2017 CCQM-K147 "Comparison of value-assigned CRMs for niacin (vitamin B<sub>3</sub>) in milk powder and infant formula matrices" is the first Key Comparison directly testing the chemical measurement services provided to customers by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) through certified reference materials (CRMs). CRMs certified for vitamin B<sub>3</sub> (as niacin or niacinamide) content in milk powder and infant formula matrices were compared using measurements made on these materials under repeatability conditions. Five NMIs/DIs submitted seven CRMs certified for niacinamide and two CRMs certified for niacin. These materials represent most of the higher-order reference materials available in 2017 for this important nutrimental measurand.</p><p>Generalized Gauss Markov Regression (GGMR) and Bayesian methods were used to establish the Key Comparison Reference Function (KCRF) relating the CRM certified values to the repeatability measurements. The niacinamide and niacin results for all nine CRMs were deemed equivalent at the 95 % level of confidence and were used to define the KCRF for vitamin B<sub>3</sub> (as niacinamide).</p><p>Monte Carlo methods and Bayesian methods were used to estimate 95 % level-of-confidence coverage intervals for the relative degrees of equivalence of materials, %d ± U95 (%d), and of the participating NMIs/DIs, %D ± U95 (%D). The Bayesian method estimates were selected as the final DoE values. For the niacinamide and niacin materials, all of the %D ± U95(%D) intervals, were within (-10 to 10) % of the consensus results and all of these are statistically equivalent. These results demonstrate that the participating institutions can value-assign CRMs for niacinamide and/or niacin in milk powder and infant formula matrices.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Niacin, Niacinamide, milk, infant formula, CRMs</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
