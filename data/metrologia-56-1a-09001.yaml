    <p>This is the final (Draft B) report for key comparison EURAMET.AUV.A-K5 on the pressure calibration of laboratory standard microphones in the frequency range from 2 Hz to 10 kHz. Twelve national metrology institutes took part in the key comparison and the National Physical Laboratory piloted the project. Two travelling standard microphones were circulated to the participants and results in the form of regular calibration certificates were collected throughout the project. The analysis used the results for one of the microphones only and values for both sensitivity level and sensitivity phase and have been linked to the CCAUV.A K5 key comparison reference value (KCRV) via two linking laboratories (NPL and INRIM).</p>
    <p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p>
    <p>acoustics, microphones, metrology, key comparison, pressure calibration</p>
