    <p>During 2014 and 2015, fourteen national metrology institutes (NMI) took part in the CIPM key comparison CCAUV.V-K3 on the primary calibration of the complex voltage sensitivity of an accelerometer in the low frequency range. The five Euramet participants in this comparison had also participated in the RMO comparison EURAMET.AUV.V-K3 involving a total of ten Euramet NMIs. The results of the five CIPM participants have been used to link the results of the remaining five NMIs to the results in the CIPM key comparison. The degrees of equivalence between the result for each NMI and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been calculated and the results are given in the form of a matrix and graph for the ten Euramet NMIs.</p>
