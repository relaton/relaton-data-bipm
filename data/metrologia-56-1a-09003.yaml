    <p></p><p>This is the final report for CIPM key comparison CCAUV.V-K4 in the area of 'vibration' (quantity of acceleration). The aim of this comparison was to measure the voltage shock sensitivity of an accelerometer measuring chain including a standard accelerometer with a charge amplifier and the charge shock sensitivity of an accelerometer at different peak acceleration values with associated pulse durations. Nine Metrology Institutes from five RMOs have participated in the comparison with National Institute of Metrology, P.R. China as pilot lab and National Metrology Institute of Japan as co-pilot lab. For voltage shock sensitivity, all the participating laboratories provided their calibration results, which were all consistent within their declared expanded uncertainties. All participants contributed to the KCRVs calculated for six peak acceleration comparison values. For charge shock sensitivity, one participant failed to contribute to the calculation of the KCRV at 5 000 m/s<sup>2</sup> and two participating laboratories were not consistent within their declared expanded uncertainties at a total of five peak acceleration comparison values. Further improvements of their calibration devices and uncertainty evaluations will provide more accurate and reliable measurement results in the future.</p><p>KEY WORDS FOR SEARCH</p><p>Key comparison; shock acceleration; low intensity shock</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
