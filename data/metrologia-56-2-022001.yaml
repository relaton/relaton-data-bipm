abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>On 16 November 2018 a revision of the International System of
    Units (the SI) was agreed by the General Conference on Weights and Measures. The
    definitions of the base units were presented in a new format that highlighted
    the link between each unit and a defined value of an associated constant. The
    physical concepts underlying the definitions of the kilogram, the ampere, the
    kelvin and the mole have been changed. The new definition of the kilogram is of
    particular importance because it eliminated the last definition referring to an
    artefact. In this way, the new definitions use the rules of nature to create the
    rules of measurement and tie measurements at the atomic and quantum scales to
    those at the macroscopic level. The new definitions do not prescribe particular
    realization methods and hence will allow the development of new and more accurate
    measurement techniques.</p>
