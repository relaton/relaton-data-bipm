abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Non-classical correlations in optical beams offer an unprecedented
    opportunity for surpassing the conventional limits of sensitivity and resolution
    in optical measurements and imaging, especially, but not only, when low photon
    flux, down to the single photon, is measured. We review the principles of quantum
    imaging and sensing techniques that exploit sub-Poissonian photon statistics and
    non-classical photon number correlation, presenting some state-of-the-art achievements
    in the field. These quantum photonics protocols have the potential to trigger
    major steps in many applications, such as microscopy and biophotonics, and represent
    an important opportunity for a new deal in radiometry and photometry.</p>
