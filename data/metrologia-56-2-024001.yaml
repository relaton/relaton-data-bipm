    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Non-classical correlations in optical beams offer an unprecedented opportunity for surpassing the conventional limits of sensitivity and resolution in optical measurements and imaging, especially, but not only, when low photon flux, down to the single photon, is measured. We review the principles of quantum imaging and sensing techniques that exploit sub-Poissonian photon statistics and non-classical photon number correlation, presenting some state-of-the-art achievements in the field. These quantum photonics protocols have the potential to trigger major steps in many applications, such as microscopy and biophotonics, and represent an important opportunity for a new deal in radiometry and photometry.</p>
