abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Although solution-state NMR is frequently used in metrologically-traceable
    quantification studies, this is not the case for solid-state NMR. However, solid-state
    NMR allows quantification of substances without the need of dissolution, providing
    a truly non-destructive approach, and extending metrologically-traceable quantitative
    NMR to sample classes that are difficult to characterize in solution. In this
    contribution we present a thorough and rigorous protocol for<sup>19</sup>F quantitative
    solid-state NMR employing a certified reference material as external calibrant
    to provide metrological traceability to absolutely quantify the content of trifluoroacetic
    acid (TFA) in a peptide sample, typically the major impurity in synthetic peptides.
    The protocol includes determining the quantitative volume of the solid-state NMR
    sample holder (rotor), the ERETIC (electronic reference to access in vivo concentrations)
    method (Akoka et al 1999 Anal. Chem. 71 2554) to compensate for variations in
    the sensitivity of the radio frequency resonant circuit when an external calibrant
    is used, and the EASY (elimination of artefacts in NMR spectroscopy) method (Jaeger
    and Hemmann 2014 Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson. 57â€“58 22) to effectively suppress
    the<sup>19</sup>F NMR background signal from the probe head. We applied the protocol
    to quantify the amount of TFA in a candidate NRC certified reference material
    of the peptide angiotensin II. The results obtained by<sup>19</sup>F quantitative
    solid-state NMR are in excellent agreement with those obtained by quantitative
    NMR in solution employing an internal calibrant.</p>
