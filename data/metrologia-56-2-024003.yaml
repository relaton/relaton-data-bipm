abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In a forecast of the revised international system of units,
    that will come into force on 20th May 2019, the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt
    is developing and establishing a strategic concept, that allows the kilogram to
    be realized and distributed on the basis of new artefacts and methods. Possible
    paths of the quantum-based kilogram from its definition based on the Planck constant
    to the macroscopic world are being elucidated, i.e. the use of silicon spheres
    of different qualities as well as the use of Kibble-Balances and new developments
    of table-top weighing instruments. Beside metrological aims the availability of
    realizations and easy handling procedures are of crucial importance within a future
    dissemination chain. Advantages and disadvantages of different approaches are
    being examined and current developments, basically on the silicon route, and their
    expected measurement uncertainty are outlined. Scientific and strategic developments
    in the use of silicon spheres in the future mass dissemination chain are accompanied
    by more than 20 national metrological institutes and designated institutes by
    testing the existing methods and doing their own investigations.</p>
