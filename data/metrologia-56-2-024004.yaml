abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Testosterone, an analyte of interest to medical testing laboratories,
    was purity assigned using a mass balance approach, to afford a certified value
    of 986  ±  3 mg g<sup>−1</sup> with established metrological traceability to the
    SI unit for mass (kg). The gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection
    (GC-FID) analysis identified the thermal degradation of testosterone as a source
    of bias, and confirmed the other four impurities to be steroids of closely related
    structure through co-elution studies. Combined with measures of water, solvent
    and non-volatile residue the total purity was in agreement with that determined
    by the complementary quantitative NMR spectroscopy, providing a high level of
    confidence that the certified value was bias free. This sample was then used to
    investigate the applicability of charged aerosol detection to the assessment of
    high accuracy, low uncertainty organic purity determination of steroids. The relative
    peak areas of testosterone and impurities varied depending on the concentration
    of the test solution, precluding the direct conversion of peak areas to an accurate
    realization of the relative mass fraction. One impurity, androst-4,6-diene-17β-ol-3-one,
    being overestimated by 155% compared to the GC-FID result. Charged aerosol detection
    (CAD) calibration curves established for testosterone and each impurity confirmed
    the detector response to vary by up to 30% at low levels (0–20 μg g<sup>−1</sup>),
    thereby challenging the view that the CAD response is independent of structure.
    Despite this, using the calibration curve of testosterone to quantify each impurity
    delivered a reasonable estimate of organic purity. The variations in detector
    response for each analyte were used to assign a conservative uncertainty to the
    calculated value, offering a way forward when CAD is to be used for a less well
    defined material.</p><p>Finally, the candidate material demonstrated a propensity
    to absorb water, highlighting the need to monitor water absorption during on-going
    stability trials.</p>
