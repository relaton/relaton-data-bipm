    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Long-term absolute gravity monitoring has a wide range of applications in the field of geodesy, geophysics, seismology, volcanology, hydrology, etc. The traditional method of long-term absolute gravity monitoring is realized by the combination of absolute gravimeter and relative gravimeter. Here we report on a new type of compact gravimeter based on atom interferometry used for long-term absolute gravity measurements. The long-term absolute gravity monitoring could be carried out with only a single instrument. Over the course of a month we took long-term absolute gravity measurements in a seismic station. With an interrogation time of 120 ms and a repetition rate of 2 Hz, the sensitivity of our cold atom gravimeter reaches 300 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metaafcc7ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> without any vibration isolation system, and the gravity residual fluctuations are within  ±60 µGal.</p>
