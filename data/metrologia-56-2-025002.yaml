abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This work describes a metrological comparison between nanonewton
    force references derived from an electrostatic force balance (EFB) and photon
    pressure from laser optical power in the 1 Watt range. An EFB is used to measure
    photon pressure force in the 10 nanonewton range from the reflection of a laser
    from a low (approximately 10<sup>−5</sup>) loss III–V semiconductor distributed
    Bragg reflector (DBR) mirror while the power of the reflected beam was simultaneously
    monitored with a traceable thermopile detector. This work demonstrates a method
    to link mass, force and laser power within the international system of units (SI)
    with explicit treatment of absorption, diffuse reflection, and a detailed uncertainty
    analysis. Additionally, it demonstrates a viable method to scale this force continuously
    using a pulsed laser technique while maintaining the constant thermal load necessary
    for precision measurement of nanonewton forces with a mechanical balance.</p>
