abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper uses the Bayesian model-selection to find the linear
    regression that is most supported by the data. It uses a hierarchical model to
    improve and to extend to weighted data from the results of a previous investigation.
    As an application example, it shows how the results can be used to investigate
    the consistency of measurements carried out to determine the central second-moment
    of the angular power-spectrum of a laser beam.</p>
