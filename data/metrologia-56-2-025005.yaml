abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) is a
    primary technique for the generation of coordinated universal time (UTC). At present,
    more than 12 timing laboratories around the world use SAtellite Time and Ranging
    Equipment (SATRE) modems in TWSTFT operations and contribute data for the realization
    of UTC. The advantages of TWSTFT are its small calibration uncertainty (⩽1.0 ns
    if the link is calibrated with a TWSTFT mobile station) and its long-term link
    stability. However, the precision of SATRE TWSTFT in the operational networks
    is degraded by a daily variation pattern (diurnal) in the TWSTFT results. The
    diurnal with varying amplitude appears virtually in all SATRE TWSTFT links. The
    observed peak-to-peak variation of the diurnals can reach 2.0 ns in some cases.
    So far, studies on the sources of the diurnal have not provided conclusive understanding
    of the diurnal’s dominant origin.</p><p>Therefore, efforts have been made to reduce
    the impact of the diurnal variation in TWSTFT for UTC computation. The BIPM has
    been using the combination of SATRE TWSTFT results and GPS carrier-phase precise
    point positioning solutions (GPSPPP) for UTC computation since 2010. The combination
    adjusts the GPSPPP results to long-term averages of TWSTFT and is effectively
    free from the diurnal variations because the GPSPPP results contain almost no
    diurnal. Lately, the use of software-defined radio receivers (SDR) in TWSTFT has
    shown one way of how to reduce the diurnal variations by a factor of two to three
    in most of the inner-continental SATRE TWSTFT links, and furthermore, how the
    short-term stability for all UTC SDR TWSTFT links can be improved. In addition,
    there has been research on the full use of the redundancy in the TWSTFT network
    to improve the TWSTFT link stability. Recent studies on evaluating indirect links
    revealed that it is possible to apply a simplified procedure to use the redundancy,
    in a most effective way, to reduce the diurnal variations in the Europe-to-Europe
    SATRE TWSTFT links by a factor of two to three. Based on these findings, we gained
    new insights about the diurnals and its dominant origin(s) which are discussed
    in this paper. The methods of the combination of SATRE TWSTFT and GPSPPP as well
    as the indirect SATRE TWSTFT links utilize the redundancy in the UTC time transfer
    network. SDR TWSTFT can largely reduce the diurnal in SATRE TWSTFT, but noticeable
    residual diurnal remains. In this paper, we provide the analyses of using the
    combination of SDR TWSTFT and GPSPPP results, as well as using the indirect SDR
    TWSTFT links. This paper concludes that the use of SDR TWSTFT redundant links
    can further improve the stabilities of UTC TWSTFT links. In addition, the use
    of SDR TWSTFT indirect links is a pure TWSTFT solution. The independence of the
    TWSTFT results to GPS results can improve the robustness of UTC computation.</p>
