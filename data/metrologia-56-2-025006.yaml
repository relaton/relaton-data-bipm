abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We investigate an estimation strategy for multiple clock systems,
    which is in particular resilient against clock anomalies. The clock anomalies,
    including frequency or phase jumps, can potentially degrade the estimation performance
    for multiple clock systems. While the conventional Kalman filter is known as one
    of the powerful methods for the estimation problem of multiple clock systems,
    we will show that it is vulnerable to the effects of clock anomalies. In this
    paper, we overcome this issue by employing an alternative approach to the Kalman
    filter, which is based on solving the -norm optimization problem. The estimation
    method employs a multiple clock model that includes only phase states. Nevertheless,
    the approach is shown to have more resilience against clock anomalies than the
    Kalman filter, because the deviation of the state from the apriori estimate is
    evaluated based on the -norm instead of the -norm. Moreover, the approach is shown
    to be competitive with many reset algorithms, since it does neighter require special
    stability assumptions about the reference clock, nor require any threshold for
    detecting the anomalies. The usefulness of the proposed method is validated through
    several numerical examples using actual clock data.</p>
