- content: Abstract<p>A low-temperature low-pressure humidity chamber has been developed
    at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science for the calibration of
    radiosonde humidity sensors. The humidity generator operates in a two-temperature
    and two-pressure mode in which a saturator and a test chamber are separately immersed
    in two baths. The saturation performance of the saturator is first evaluated at
    a low temperature (−75 °C) and at atmospheric pressure. In this condition, the
    uncertainty of the frost-point temperature by the saturator is 53 mK with the
    coverage factor k  =  2. Then, a chilled mirror hygrometer is calibrated for the
    compensation of low-pressure effects such as a pressure drop along the tubing
    line inside the hygrometer. Significant differences between the frost-point temperature
    at the hygrometer inlet and that measured by the hygrometer are observed at a
    pressure lower than 20 kPa. An empirical formula for compensating the low-pressure
    effects on the hygrometer is obtained and, subsequently, is used for the validation
    of the frost-point temperature generated at a low temperature and low pressure
    in the test chamber. The corresponding uncertainty due to the calibration of the
    hygrometer including the compensation of low-pressure effects is 306 mK at k  =  2.
    A representative humidity generation and its validation by the hygrometer is demonstrated
    at a temperature (−70 °C) and two pressures (4.6 kPa and 20 kPa) in the test chamber.
    Uncertainty budgets on relative humidity in the test chamber are presented from
    10 %rh to 40 %rh with a 10 %rh interval at both pressures. Consequently, the combined
    uncertainty is less than 2%rh (k  =  2) which includes uncertainty factors such
    as the saturation efficiency, the adsorption/desorption hysteresis, the validation
    by the hygrometer measurement at low pressures, and so on. The newly developed
    humidity chamber enables the calibration of radiosonde humidity sensors at low
    temperature and low pressure conditions that mimic upper air environments in a
    traceable manner to the International System of Units (SI).</p>
