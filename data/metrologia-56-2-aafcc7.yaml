abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Long-term absolute gravity monitoring has a wide range of applications
    in the field of geodesy, geophysics, seismology, volcanology, hydrology, etc.
    The traditional method of long-term absolute gravity monitoring is realized by
    the combination of absolute gravimeter and relative gravimeter. Here we report
    on a new type of compact gravimeter based on atom interferometry used for long-term
    absolute gravity measurements. The long-term absolute gravity monitoring could
    be carried out with only a single instrument. Over the course of a month we took
    long-term absolute gravity measurements in a seismic station. With an interrogation
    time of 120 ms and a repetition rate of 2 Hz, the sensitivity of our cold atom
    gravimeter reaches 300  without any vibration isolation system, and the gravity
    residual fluctuations are within  ±60 µGal.</p>
