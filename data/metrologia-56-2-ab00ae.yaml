abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Optical (e.g. interferometric or laser focus probe) measurement
    of dimensions must be corrected to take into account phase change on reflection
    and the influence of surface roughness in order to be compatible with mechanical
    dimension measurement methods (e.g. tactile probes). One typical example is interferometric
    measurement of a gauge block; while a correction of only a few nanometres is needed
    for standard interferometric measurement of a gauge block wrung on a platen made
    of the same material, a correction of tens of nanometres is needed when different
    materials are used (e.g. a steel gauge block on a glass platen) and even a total
    correction of up to a hundred nanometres is needed for some gauges when a double-ended
    interferometer is used. Here we describe and evaluate a Newton’s rings method
    that enables direct estimation of such correction. The implementation of this
    method is described, the sensitivities to experimental adjustments are discussed,
    and the results are compared with standard measurements within EURAMET project
    No. 1272. The resulting central length measured with a double-ended interferometer
    and corrected using the Newton’s rings method agrees well with the standard measurement
    results within a total uncertainty of     20 nm for both steel and ceramic gauges.
    Unlike the stack method, the Newton’s rings method enables measurement of the
    correction for an individual sample (e.g. gauge block) and can easily be done
    for both short and long gauges with equal speed and uncertainty.</p>
