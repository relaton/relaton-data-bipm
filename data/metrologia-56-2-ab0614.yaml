abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two approaches to steering clocks to a reference standard via
    frequency steers have been explored in the literature, the pole placement (PP)
    approach and the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) approach. The PP method sets
    the response time of the controlled clock. LQG minimizes a user-selected cost
    function, which is a linear combination of the expected variances of the phase,
    frequency, and control effort (frequency steers). This paper unifies these techniques
    by developing an analysis that quantifies what time constants follow from the
    LQG-derived gains, and what costs are incurred by the PP-derived gains. With this
    analysis, one can compute how sensitive the outcomes would be to variations of
    the steering constants. Another outcome we present is a quantification of the
    degradation due to a common form of suboptimal state estimation, as well as that
    due to delays before steering decisions can be implemented into the system.</p>
