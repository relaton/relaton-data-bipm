abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The isotopic composition of isotopically enriched materials
    is essential for isotope dilution mass spectrometry and calibrated mass spectrometry,
    which are considered to be potential primary methods/authority methods of the
    highest metrological quality for the analysis of elemental content or isotopic
    compositions. In this study, a total evaporation (TE) technique was developed
    for accurate determination of isotopic compositions for seven enriched molybdenum
    materials with the utilization of negative ion-thermal ionization mass spectrometry
    (NTIMS). By using La(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> as an activator, the sample was
    efficiently ionized into      for NTIMS measurement. To achieve highly precise
    results, the oxygen isotope interference in      on Mo isotopic analysis was corrected
    by using the IUPAC recommended isotopic compositions for atmospheric O<sub>2</sub>.
    Various sources of uncertainty to TE-NTIMS, such as measurement repeatability,
    oxide interference correction, and the ion loss before and after measurement were
    discussed with respect to the determination of their uncertainty contribution
    and their influence on the results. As a result, the major isotope abundance for
    each enriched Mo material were determined as ( k   =  2):  x (<sup>92</sup>Mo)  =  0.974 69  ±  11
    for enriched Mo-92,  x (<sup>94</sup>Mo)  =  0.920 26  ±  11 for enriched Mo-94,  x
    (<sup>95</sup>Mo)  =  0.965 50  ±  20 for enriched Mo-95,  x (<sup>96</sup>Mo)  =  0.967 59  ±  12
    for enriched Mo-96,  x (<sup>97</sup>Mo)  =  0.942 06  ±  13 for enriched Mo-97,  x
    (<sup>98</sup>Mo)  =  0.984 56  ±  11 for enriched Mo-98, and  x (<sup>100</sup>Mo)  =  0.993 655  ±  12
    for enriched Mo-100, respectively. These measurement results have been compared
    to those determined by a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
    via the mathematical iteration method in our previous work. Identical major isotope-abundance
    values were achieved within their combined standard uncertainties, indicating
    that the TE technique is a powerful and alternative tool for accurate determination
    of the isotopic composition for isotopically enriched materials. The potential
    influence owing to the variations of O isotopic compositions during NTIMS measurements
    were also investigated by applying the ‘In-run O’ isotope-abundance values reported
    in recent literatures for O isotope interference correction. The corrected Mo
    isotope abundances of either the major or the minor isotopes were in good agreement
    with that corrected by using the IUPAC atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> isotopic compositions.</p>'
