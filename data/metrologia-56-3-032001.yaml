abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The principles and techniques of primary refractive-index gas
    thermometry (RIGT) are reviewed. Absolute primary RIGT using microwave measurements
    of helium-filled quasi-spherical resonators has been implemented at the temperatures
    of the triple points of neon, oxygen, argon and water, with relative standard
    uncertainties ranging from 9.1  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> to 3.5  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>.
    Researchers are now also using argon-filled cylindrical microwave resonators for
    RIGT near ambient temperature, with relative standard uncertainties between 3.8  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>
    and 4.6  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>, and conducting relative RIGT measurements on isobars
    at low temperatures. RIGT at optical frequencies is progressing, and has been
    used to perform a Boltzmann constant measurement at room temperature with a relative
    standard uncertainty of 1.2  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>. Uncertainty budgets from implementations
    of absolute primary microwave RIGT, relative primary microwave RIGT and absolute
    primary optical RIGT are provided.</p>
