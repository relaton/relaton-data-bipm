    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The principles and techniques of primary refractive-index gas thermometry (RIGT) are reviewed. Absolute primary RIGT using microwave measurements of helium-filled quasi-spherical resonators has been implemented at the temperatures of the triple points of neon, oxygen, argon and water, with relative standard uncertainties ranging from 9.1  ×  10<sup>−6</sup> to 3.5  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>. Researchers are now also using argon-filled cylindrical microwave resonators for RIGT near ambient temperature, with relative standard uncertainties between 3.8  ×  10<sup>−5</sup> and 4.6  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>, and conducting relative RIGT measurements on isobars at low temperatures. RIGT at optical frequencies is progressing, and has been used to perform a Boltzmann constant measurement at room temperature with a relative standard uncertainty of 1.2  ×  10<sup>−5</sup>. Uncertainty budgets from implementations of absolute primary microwave RIGT, relative primary microwave RIGT and absolute primary optical RIGT are provided.</p>
