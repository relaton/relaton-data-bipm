abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Approaches from metrology can assist earth observation (EO)
    practitioners to develop quantitative characterisation of uncertainty in EO data.
    This is necessary for the credibility of statements based on Earth observations
    in relation to topics of public concern, particularly climate and environmental
    change. This paper presents the application of metrological uncertainty analysis
    to historical Earth observations from satellites, and is intended to aid mutual
    understanding of metrology and EO. The nature of satellite observations is summarised
    for different EO data processing levels, and key metrological nomenclature and
    principles for uncertainty characterisation are reviewed. We then address metrological
    approaches to developing estimates of uncertainty that are traceable from the
    satellite sensor, through levels of data processing, to products describing the
    evolution of the geophysical state of the Earth. EO radiances have errors with
    complex error correlation structures that are significant when performing common
    higher-level transformations of EO imagery. Principles of measurement-function-centred
    uncertainty analysis are described that apply sequentially to each EO data processing
    level. Practical tools for organising and traceably documenting uncertainty analysis
    are presented. We illustrate these principles and tools with examples including
    some specific sources of error seen in EO satellite data as well as with an example
    of the estimation of sea surface temperature from satellite infra-red imagery.
    This includes a simulation-based estimate for the error distribution of clear-sky
    infra-red brightness temperature in which calibration uncertainty and digitisation
    are found to dominate. The propagation of these errors to sea surface temperature
    is then presented, illustrating the relevance of the approach to derivation of
    EO-based climate datasets. We conclude with a discussion arguing that there is
    broad scope and need for improvement in EO practice as a measurement science.
    EO practitioners and metrologists willing to extend and adapt their disciplinary
    knowledge to meet this need can make valuable contributions to EO.</p>
