abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A detailed review and analysis of literature values for the
    absorption cross-section of ozone at room temperature at the mercury-line wavelength
    (253.65 nm, air) is reported. Data from fourteen independent sets of measurements
    spanning the years 1959–2016 were considered. The present analysis is based upon
    a revised assessment of all Type A and Type B uncertainty components for each
    previously reported cross-section. A consensus value for the absorption cross-section
    of 1.1329(35)  ×  10<sup>−17</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> molecule<sup>−1</sup> is recommended
    based on statistical analysis of the weighted data. This new cross-section value
    is 1.23% lower and its uncertainty sixfold smaller than the uncertainty of the
    conventionally accepted reference value reported by Hearn (1961 Proc. Phys. Soc.
    78 932–40).</p>
