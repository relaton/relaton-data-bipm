abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Metrological traceability to the International System of Units
    (SI) is required to ensure reliability of analytical results. For this purpose,
    SI-traceable standard solutions of respective analytes are essential for common
    analytical methods such as chromatography. However, it is not so easy to fulfill
    demands due to the existence of a vast number of targets, especially in the case
    of organic analysis. Because high-purity organic materials which are raw materials
    of standard solutions must be characterized by compound-independent methods, the
    mass balance approach (subtraction method) and the primary methods of measurement
    (e.g. the freezing point depression method and titrimetry) are used. Recently,
    quantitative NMR (qNMR) has been popularized.</p><p>The National Metrology Institute
    of Japan, the National Institute of Advanced Industry, Science and Technology
    (NMIJ/AIST) has been supplying many types of reference materials including high-purity
    organic materials and organic standard solutions. In 2015, the demand of traceable
    reference materials for drinking water analyses rose by an amendment of a notification
    under the Waterworks Act of Japan. In this manuscript, NMIJâ€™s efforts such as
    supplying certified reference materials and providing calibration services in
    this field are outlined. Among them, direct characterization of multi-components
    standard solutions by qNMR/chromatography or post-column reaction gas chromatography
    is an efficient approach to realize new traceability schemes without the step
    of a purity assessment of each reference material.</p>
