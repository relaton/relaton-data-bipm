    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The <italic>Working Group on Electrochemical Analysis and Classical Chemical Methods</italic> (EAWG) of the <italic>Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology</italic> conducts regular pilot studies and key comparisons to ensure international consistency of electric conductivity measurement results of electrolyte solutions with an uncertainty of around 0.02% at the highest level. Apart from supporting the international calibration infrastructure, comparison measurements have also been used to investigate specific metrological issues related to conductivity measurements which will be reviewed in this paper. First, two different metrological references coexist for conductivity measurements, namely the SI and recipe-based primary conductivity standards, the implications of which will be discussed. Furthermore, pilot study P142 and subsequent investigations by an EAWG expert group have revealed significant inconsistencies in the equivalence of conductance ratios. Such conductance ratios are the basis for assigning conductivity values to secondary standards and conductivity measurements in the field. The activities of the EAWG to investigate this fundamental issue will be reviewed. Finally, the metrological support for conductivity measurements of new kinds of conductivity standards will be outlined.</p>
