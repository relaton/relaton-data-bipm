abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The Working Group on Electrochemical Analysis and Classical
    Chemical Methods (EAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance:
    Metrology in Chemistry and Biology conducts regular pilot studies and key comparisons
    to ensure international consistency of electric conductivity measurement results
    of electrolyte solutions with an uncertainty of around 0.02% at the highest level.
    Apart from supporting the international calibration infrastructure, comparison
    measurements have also been used to investigate specific metrological issues related
    to conductivity measurements which will be reviewed in this paper. First, two
    different metrological references coexist for conductivity measurements, namely
    the SI and recipe-based primary conductivity standards, the implications of which
    will be discussed. Furthermore, pilot study P142 and subsequent investigations
    by an EAWG expert group have revealed significant inconsistencies in the equivalence
    of conductance ratios. Such conductance ratios are the basis for assigning conductivity
    values to secondary standards and conductivity measurements in the field. The
    activities of the EAWG to investigate this fundamental issue will be reviewed.
    Finally, the metrological support for conductivity measurements of new kinds of
    conductivity standards will be outlined.</p>'
