abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To ensure the accurate measurement of the water content in various
    materials, certified reference materials (CRMs) which are traceable to the International
    System of Units (SI) are required. The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ)
    has developed a CRM, water in methylcyclohexane (0.02 mg g<sup>−1</sup>), for
    quality control of trace water analyses in liquids. The water content of the CRM
    was determined by coulometric Karl Fischer titration as a primary method of measurements.
    The traceability of the electric charge applied on the titration was ensured to
    realize metrological traceability of the certified value to the SI. The uncertainties
    due to the analytical method, homogeneity, and long-term and short-term stabilities
    were evaluated and reflected in the uncertainty of the certified value. The certified
    value of the CRM was 0.018 mg g<sup>−1</sup> and its expanded uncertainty, calculated
    using a coverage factor of k  =  2, was 0.005 mg g<sup>−1</sup>. The new CRM can
    be applied for the validation of measurement instruments and procedures used in
    analyzing trace water. The technical details of the characterization of water
    in NMIJ CRM 4229-a are described in this paper.</p>
