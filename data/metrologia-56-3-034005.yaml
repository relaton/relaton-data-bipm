abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>ICP-MS has played a key role in inorganic chemical metrology
    for 25 years, from the 1993 CIPM feasibility study which led to establishment
    of the CCQM. Since that time, the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of the CCQM
    has organised 56 international comparisons involving measurements by ICP-MS and,
    in a recent comparison, 16 different national institutes submitted their results
    using the technique. Metrological applications of ICP-MS currently address an
    enormous range of measurements using a wide variety of instrumentation, calibration
    strategies and methodologies. This review provides an overview of the ICP-MS field
    with an emphasis on developments which are of particular relevance to chemical
    metrology. Examples from CCQM comparisons and the services available from the
    participants are used to illustrate how the capability and scope of ICP-MS methods
    have expanded far beyond the expectations of 1993. This is due in part to the
    research and development programmes of the national institutes which participate
    in the CCQM. They have played a key role in advancing new instrumentation and
    applications for elemental analysis, isotope dilution mass spectrometry, determination
    of isotopic ratio or composition, and speciation of organometallic compounds.
    These developments are continuing today, as demonstrated by work in new fields
    such as heteroatom quantitation of proteins, characterisation and counting of
    nanoparticles using spICP-MS, and LA-ICP-MS analysis of solid materials.</p>
