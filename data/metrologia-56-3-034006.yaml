abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We present the global research landscape which aims to deliver
    a measurement infrastructure to underpin atmospheric observations of key greenhouse
    gases governing changes in the Earthâ€™s climate. These measurements present a significant
    challenge to the metrological community, analytical laboratories and major producers
    of reference materials. The review focuses on the progress made in the Gas Analysis
    Working Group of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology
    in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM-GAWG) in establishing the primary realisation of
    the amount-of-substance fraction for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide
    in an air matrix. It also focuses on the importance of providing traceable measurements
    of isotopic composition of these components for commutability of reference materials
    and for isotope ratio measurements for greenhouse gas source attribution. The
    review examines the developments in the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme
    of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for providing the framework for
    the development and implementation of integrated greenhouse gas observations,
    which is vital for understanding the global carbon cycle and the role greenhouse
    gases play in climate change. The developments in analytical techniques are also
    discussed which have shaped the direction of the metrology required to meet the
    evolving and future needs of stakeholders.</p>'
