abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>There are many interlaboratory studies for which the commonly
    employed random effects model is not adequate as the heterogeneous discrepant
    data indicate quite different (larger) variances for some participating laboratories.
    Motivated by such examples we provide methods to choose a more flexible paradigm
    with a number of different clusters each consisting of laboratories having the
    same heterogeneity variance. Then the largest homogeneous (consistent) data subset
    corresponds to zero heteroscedasticity. The paper is focused on its determination
    when all heterogeneous observations are put into one class so that there is just
    one positive heterogeneity variance. The likelihood based procedures which determine
    the clusters are obtained in the general case. A Bayes rule against a non-informative
    prior is suggested for model averaging.</p>
