abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We demonstrate the measurement of detection efficiency, the
    probability for the successful detection of a single photon incident on a detector,
    in a wide wavelength range from 250 nm to 1000 nm. The method is based on the
    responsivity comparison of two detectors by using a tunable monochromatic light
    source at a radiant power controlled to the pico-Watt level. As the reference
    detector, a photodiode with a switched integrating amplifier is used, whose spectral
    responsivity is calibrated at a photo-current level of pico-Ampere. A fibre-based
    spatial filter is used to form a beam focus that is focused to a diameter of less
    than 100 µm at the detector under test. The typical uncertainty of the detection-efficiency
    measurement for a Si-based single photon avalanche photodiode is evaluated to
    be less than 1% as a relative standard uncertainty (k  =  1), which is currently
    limited by the characteristics of the tunable source.</p>
