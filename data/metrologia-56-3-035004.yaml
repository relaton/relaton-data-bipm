abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The measurement of the time difference between two heterogeneous
    electrical sources is a necessary task in several branches of metrology. In particular
    the dissemination of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) around the world requires
    one to quantify the synchronization between two or more co-located time scales.
    The task is usually carried out using a time interval counter, by directly measuring
    the time difference between signals at its inputs. We found that special care
    must be taken when a total uncertainty significantly smaller than 1 ns is desired.
    The goal of this paper is to present a complete analysis of the total uncertainty
    for the measurement of time differences between co-located time scales, with considerations
    for improvement.</p>
