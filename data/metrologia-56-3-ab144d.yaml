abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Clock steering is an important discipline within the time and
    frequency community as well as in cognate disciplines such as global navigation
    satellite systems (GNSSs). In the latter, clock steering is a mandatory tool for
    realizations of time scales, which first are typically created by algorithms forming
    a paper clock. Often, this software solution of a time scale is already sufficient.
    However, sometimes a realization in the form of a frequency signal is feasible
    or even necessary. Future GNSSs concepts plan to use composite clocks consisting
    of several different clocks to achieve synchronization of satellites within one
    orbit with the system time. In this approach, a real clock output in the microwave
    regime is indispensable. Therefore, a real clock has to be steered against the
    paper clock to realize the composite clock. Consequently, steering techniques
    are an essential piece for obtaining a realization. Besides the number of algorithms
    to choose from, there are several parameters that need to be defined by the user
    to achieve the best performance for distinct scenarios. In this paper we compare
    the realization performance and applicability of two different steering techniques,
    namely linear-quadratic Gaussian control and pole placement, in a simplified hardware
    setup. The studied scenario consists of a steerable clock consisting of a micro
    phase stepper which changes the frequency of the output of an oven-controlled
    quartz oscillator (OCXO) and a rubidium atomic clock (RB). The OCXO in turn is
    steered to follow the free-running RB as closely as possible. Steering the output
    of the OCXO introduces a new process in the clock. As a result, the Allan deviation
    of the steered clock shows a bump which location is dependent on the chosen control
    interval and steering technique. This has to be considered for the designated
    operation. We compare simulations of the clock steering with both techniques to
    real-data results from our laboratory.</p>
