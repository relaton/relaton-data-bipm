abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has considerably changed in
    recent years. The evolution of UTC follows the scientific and industrial progress
    by developing appropriate models, more adapted calculation algorithms, more efficient
    and rapid dissemination processes and a well defined traceability chain. The enormous
    technical progress worldwide has resulted in an impressive number of atomic clocks
    now available for UTC calculation. The refined time and frequency transfer techniques
    are approaching the accuracy requested for the new definition of the SI second.
    The more regular operation of primary frequency standards (PFS) increases the
    accuracy of UTC and opens a possible new development for time scale algorithms.
    From the metrological point of view all the ingredients are available for major
    improvements to UTC. Dissemination of UTC is done by the monthly publication of
    results in BIPM Circular T. This document makes a quality evaluation of local
    representations of UTC, named UTC(k), in national institutes, and other organizations,
    by giving the evolution of their offsets relative to UTC and their respective
    uncertainties. The clock models adopted and the time transfer techniques have
    progressively improved over the years, assuring the long-term stability of UTC.
    Each computation of UTC processes data over one month with five-day sampling and
    publication. A rapid solution of UTC (UTCr) has existed since 2013, and consists
    of the processing of daily sampled data over four consecutive weeks, computed
    and published weekly. It gives quick access to UTC, and allows participating laboratories
    to better monitor the offsets of their realizations to the reference UTC. The
    traditional monthly publication, containing results of all the laboratories contributing
    data to the BIPM for the computation of UTC was complemented after the establishment
    of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement of the International Committee on Weights
    and Measures (CIPM MRA). This time comparison, which has been the responsibility
    of the BIPM since 1988, added as a complement the key comparison on time defined
    by the Consultative Committee for Time and Frequency (CCTF) in 2006 as CCTF-K001.UTC,
    where the results published are those of national metrology institutes (NMIs)
    signatories of the CIPM MRA, or designated institutes (DIs). The traceability
    issues are formalized in the framework of the CIPM MRA. The development of time
    metrology activities in the different metrology regions, supports the actions
    of the BIPM time department to improve the accuracy of [UTC–UTC(k)], where the
    coordination with the Regional Metrology Organizations (RMOs) has a key role.
    This paper presents an overview of UTC.</p>
