    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The status of angles within The International System of Units (SI) has long been a source of controversy and confusion. We address one specific but crucial issue, putting the case that the idea of angles necessarily being length ratios, and hence dimensionless, is not valid. By making a clear distinction between the definition of a quantity and the process of making a measurement of that quantity, we show that the usual arguments for angles being length ratios are problematic. An appreciation of this point should clear away a major obstacle preventing a more proper treatment of the angle problem.</p>
