abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measuring the number concentration (NC) of nanoparticles (NPs)
    in suspension has become important because of its use as an index of the quality
    and efficacy of medical and industrial products. Although scanning electron microscopy
    (SEM) can reveal individual particles, it is not commonly used for measurement
    owing to difficulties in sample preparation. We used a micro-liquid dispenser
    to prepare a specimen of a gold NP suspension, and by combining SEM and gravimetry
    we measured the NC. The dispenser places a small droplet of suspension onto a
    Si substrate without splashing, confining the particles in a small area. This
    method enabled us to observe and count all particles in the area by SEM without
    loss. The average weight of droplets was determined from weight increments of
    multiple ejections from the dispenser into a reservoir on an analytical balance.
    Dividing the NP number by single droplet weight gives NC in g<sup>−1</sup>. Our
    simple method gave a precise measurement of the NC of Au NPs with a relative expanded
    uncertainty of  &lt;6% (k  =  2) by identifying all particles in a droplet.</p>
