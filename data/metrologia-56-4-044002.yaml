    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Following the revision of the International System of Units (SI), that takes effect on 20 May 2019, the unit mole is defined by using a fixed number of elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, which is the defining constant of the unit mole. This definition was made possible because the determination of the Avogadro constant had reached a level of relative uncertainty that allowed its value to be fixed and, at the same time, safeguard continuity of measurement results before and after the definition. The motivation for the revision of the SI and the mole in particular will be explained and the experimental work that allowed it is summarized.</p>
