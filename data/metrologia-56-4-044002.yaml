abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Following the revision of the International System of Units
    (SI), that takes effect on 20 May 2019, the unit mole is defined by using a fixed
    number of elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the
    Avogadro constant, which is the defining constant of the unit mole. This definition
    was made possible because the determination of the Avogadro constant had reached
    a level of relative uncertainty that allowed its value to be fixed and, at the
    same time, safeguard continuity of measurement results before and after the definition.
    The motivation for the revision of the SI and the mole in particular will be explained
    and the experimental work that allowed it is summarized.</p>
