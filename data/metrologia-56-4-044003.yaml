abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The nitrogen content of amidosulfuric acid was first measured
    directly by coulometric titration. Ammonium ions generated by decomposition of
    amidosulfuric acid were oxidized with electrogenerated hypobromite ions to nitrogen
    gas, and the amount of which was linked to the International System of Units (SI)
    based on Faradayâ€™s laws of electrolysis. Conditions of the decomposition in an
    acidic medium were examined under different periods of heating. The comprehensive
    evaluation of the measurement uncertainties for amidosulfuric acid as an acid
    and as nitrogen was carried out, resulting in the establishment of a certified
    reference material (CRM) for both measurands with SI traceability. A novel measurement
    method for nitrogen content of amidosulfuric acid was ascertained. The relationship
    of three materials, amidosulfuric acid, ammonium chloride and sodium chloride,
    was also presented. The traceability among three materials was clarified through
    three different reactions, neutralization, oxidation-reduction and precipitation
    reactions. The assays of these materials were all consistent; consequently, the
    accuracy of measurement methods used was ascertained. Providing the CRM with the
    SI traceable nitrogen content enables one to obtain reliable analytical data in
    several applications such as the Kjeldahl method.</p>
