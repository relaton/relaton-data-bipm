    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We review recent precision measurements on semiconductor tunable-barrier electron pumps operating in a ratchet mode. Seven studies on five different designs of pumps have reported measurements of the pump current with relative total uncertainties around 10<sup>−6</sup> or less. Combined with theoretical models of electron capture by the pumps, these experimental data exhibits encouraging evidence that the pumps operate according to a universal mechanism, independent of the details of device design. Evidence for robustness of the pump current against changes in the control parameters is at a more preliminary stage, but also encouraging, with two studies reporting robustness of the pump current against three or more parameters in the range of  ∼<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab29a5ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> to  ∼<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab29a5ieqn002.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>. This review highlights the need for an agreed protocol for tuning the electron pump for optimal operation, as well as more rigorous evaluations of the robustness in a wide range of pump designs.</p>
