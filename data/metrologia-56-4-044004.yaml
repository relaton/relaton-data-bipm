abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We review recent precision measurements on semiconductor tunable-barrier
    electron pumps operating in a ratchet mode. Seven studies on five different designs
    of pumps have reported measurements of the pump current with relative total uncertainties
    around 10<sup>−6</sup> or less. Combined with theoretical models of electron capture
    by the pumps, these experimental data exhibits encouraging evidence that the pumps
    operate according to a universal mechanism, independent of the details of device
    design. Evidence for robustness of the pump current against changes in the control
    parameters is at a more preliminary stage, but also encouraging, with two studies
    reporting robustness of the pump current against three or more parameters in the
    range of  ∼ to  ∼. This review highlights the need for an agreed protocol for
    tuning the electron pump for optimal operation, as well as more rigorous evaluations
    of the robustness in a wide range of pump designs.</p>
