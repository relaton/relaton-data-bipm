    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The precision of optically based techniques for long term CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring in the atmosphere is approaching the  ±0.02 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> level, however biases of potentially up to fifteen times greater than this can arise due to differences in isotopic composition of sample and calibration gases used. We have developed and describe a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method for CO<sub>2</sub> mole fraction measurements, using an instrument configured with a liquid N<sub>2</sub>-cooled mid-infrared indium antimonide (InSb) detector and a 10.01 m multipass Whitetype gas cell (0.75 l) and fitting of the <sup>12</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub> isotopologue absorption in the wavenumber region (3500–3800) cm<sup>−1</sup> where the measurement bias resulting from isotopic variation between sample and calibration gases can be corrected for. The method was completed with a comprehensive uncertainty budget from which considerations on the importance of spectroscopic specific biases could be deduced. The method was validated using 29 standards produced by 15 National Metrology Institutes/Designated Institutes, including the Central and a Regional Calibration Laboratory (McClenny <italic>et al</italic> 2002 <italic>J. Air Waste Manag. Assoc</italic>. <bold>52</bold> 542–62) from the World Meteorological Organization (2011 WMO/TD-No. 1560, Ed.: Hohenpeissenberg Metrological Observatory), with <italic>δ</italic><sup>13</sup>C values in CO<sub>2</sub> ranging from  −0.4‰ to  −67‰ versus VPDB. The standards were all produced with CO<sub>2</sub> mole fractions typical of background atmosphere calibration gases (either 380 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> or 480 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup>), and reference values for each of them were established during a comparison performed with a GC-FID analyzer, insensitive to their isotopic composition. Measurements have confirmed that a Δ<italic>δ</italic><sup>13</sup>C of 1‰ between sample and calibration gases can bias the CO<sub>2</sub> mole fraction measurements made by FTIR by 4 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> and a Δ<italic>δ</italic><sup>18</sup>O of 1‰ by 2 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. These biases can be corrected with the method described here, allowing FTIR based measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> mole fraction with standard uncertainties reaching 0.05 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to be achieved, even if sample and calibration gases isotopic ratios differ. These findings have significant implications for the use of CO<sub>2</sub> calibration mixtures in particular for the atmospheric community, when high accuracy measurements are required.</p>
