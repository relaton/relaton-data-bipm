abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The meeting forum called Standardisation of Genome Amplification
    Technologies (SoGAT) was established 25 years ago, with the purpose of improving
    the quality of infectious disease diagnostic data generated by polymerase chain
    reaction (PCR) and related techniques. This meeting has provided an expert forum
    to identify and prioritise the needs of the diagnostic community for reference
    materials established by the World Health Organisation Expert Committee for Biological
    Standardisation. Reference materials for 30 different infectious agents have been
    established and are available upon request. The improvement in the measurement
    of specific nucleic acid sequences of pathogens arising from the availability
    of their cognate standard and the challenges going forward in this field are discussed.</p>
