    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The meeting forum called Standardisation of Genome Amplification Technologies (SoGAT) was established 25 years ago, with the purpose of improving the quality of infectious disease diagnostic data generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and related techniques. This meeting has provided an expert forum to identify and prioritise the needs of the diagnostic community for reference materials established by the World Health Organisation Expert Committee for Biological Standardisation. Reference materials for 30 different infectious agents have been established and are available upon request. The improvement in the measurement of specific nucleic acid sequences of pathogens arising from the availability of their cognate standard and the challenges going forward in this field are discussed.</p>
