abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Despite the numerous important applications of hafnium isotopes
    in geological science, and the advances in multi-collector inductively coupled
    plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS), hafnium still lacks calibrated measurements
    of its isotope ratios and, in turn, isotopic abundances and atomic weight. In
    this study, we determined the isotopic composition of hafnium in four commercial
    hafnium reagents, including a commonly used hafnium standard (JMC-475) and a NRC
    candidate isotopic reference material (HALF-1) by MC-ICPMS. The state-of-the-art
    regression model with NIST SRM 989 isotopic rhenium as calibrator was used to
    correct instrumental isotopic fractionation without reliance on other hafnium
    standards, normalizing isotope ratios, or exponential mass-bias fractionation
    model.</p>
