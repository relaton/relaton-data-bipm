abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>According to the CIPM mutual recognition arrangement, a calibration
    and measurement capability (CMC) uncertainty for a laboratory offering a particular
    calibration or measurement service is normally expressed at a 95 % level of confidence.
    When laboratories’ CMC claims are unsupported by the relevant key comparison (KC),
    after publishing the final report of the KC, modified values may have to be assigned
    to their CMC uncertainties. In many cases when CMCs apply to a continuous interval
    of values such as mass fraction or wavelength, KCs are carried out for selected
    discrete values of the quantity concerned. Since the comparison at each discrete
    value may only support the CMC uncertainty at that point, it is not immediately
    apparent how to modify the CMC uncertainties. Under realistic assumptions, we
    developed a method that is applicable in such an instance and for which the reported
    CMC uncertainties are amplified so that they are underpinned by the results of
    the KC. The amplification factors depend on the laboratories’ degrees of equivalence
    (DoEs) for these discrete values, judiciously adjusted to achieve consistency
    with the key comparison reference values. The method is based on the patterns
    in the individual behaviour of the DoEs of the participating laboratories for
    the discrete values, implying the presence of correlation associated with the
    DoE values. It applies when the weighted mean of some or all of the measured values
    reported by the participating laboratories in the KC is used to obtain the KC
    reference value.</p>
