abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, the fisheye camera method is validated for spatial
    non-uniformity corrections in luminous flux measurements with integrating spheres.
    The method was tested in eight integrating spheres with six LED lamps, and the
    determined angular intensity distributions and spatial non-uniformity correction
    factors were compared with the results of five goniophotometers. The average closeness
    score, describing the similarity between any two distributions, was 94.6 out of
    100 for the distributions obtained using the fisheye camera method when compared
    with the goniophotometric results. The average closeness score for the five goniophotometers,
    when each goniophotometer was compared with the other four, was. On average, the
    relative deviation between the two methods was 0.05% when calculating the spatial
    corrections. The most significant sources of uncertainty for the fisheye camera
    method were large, view-obstructing sphere elements residing close to the camera
    port.</p>
