abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>One of the aspirations of quantum metrology is to deliver primary
    standards directly to end-users thereby significantly shortening the traceability
    chains and enabling more accurate products. Epitaxial graphene grown on silicon
    carbide (epigraphene) is known to be a viable candidate for a primary realisation
    of a quantum Hall resistance standard, surpassing conventional semiconductor two-dimensional
    electron gases, such as those based on GaAs, in terms of performance at higher
    temperatures and lower magnetic fields. The bottleneck in the realisation of a
    turn-key quantum resistance standard requiring minimum user intervention has so
    far been the need to fine-tune the carrier density in this material to fit the
    constraints imposed by a simple cryo-magnetic system. Previously demonstrated
    methods, such as via photo-chemistry or corona discharge, require application
    prior to every cool-down as well as specialist knowledge and equipment. To this
    end we perform metrological evaluation of epigraphene with carrier density tuned
    by a recently reported permanent molecular doping technique. Measurements at two
    National Metrology Institutes confirm accurate resistance quantisation below 5
    nΩ Ω<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, samples show no significant drift in carrier concentration
    and performance on multiple thermal cycles over three years. This development
    paves the way for dissemination of primary resistance standards based on epigraphene.</p>
