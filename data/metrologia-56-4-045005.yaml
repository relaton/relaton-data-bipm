abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The liquidus temperatures of two tin fixed-point ingots having
    different impurity compositions have been determined using the adiabatic heat
    pulse-based melting technique; the employed samples were analyzed at three different
    chemical assay laboratories for characterization of the impurities present. The
    shape of the melting curves, which showed a rapid increase in the early part of
    the melt and subsequent gradual and nearly linear increase in the later part,
    were found to be qualitatively well described by the Scheil–Gulliver solidification
    model corresponding to the detected impurities of the two samples; it was understood
    that the impurities having distribution coefficients (k<sub>i</sub>) less than
    1 resulted in a rapid melting temperature change in the early part of the melt,
    and impurities having k<sub>i</sub>  &gt;  1 manifested themselves in the later
    part as a gradual increase in the melting temperature. The liquidus temperatures
    of the different tin samples were then determined by extrapolating the melting
    temperatures in the later parts of the melting range, where the variations of
    the melting temperatures were satisfactorily described by the corresponding parts
    of the Scheil–Gulliver model, to the melted fraction of unity. The determined
    liquidus temperatures of the two samples were corrected for the effect of the
    detected impurities, resulting in an agreement between the corrected temperatures
    within the claimed uncertainties. It was concluded that with the aid of the consistent
    chemical assays, the liquidus temperatures determined by the heat pulse-based
    melting and corrected for the impurity effect were able to produce the closest
    approximation to the ideal definition of the fixed-point temperature of the ITS-90,
    which is the melting temperature of the pure fixed-point substance.</p>
