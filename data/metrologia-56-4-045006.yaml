    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report speed of sound measurements in helium at 273.16 K and at eight temperatures in the range between 236 K and 430 K. These results determine the difference (<italic>T</italic>  −  <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>) between the thermodynamic temperature <italic>T</italic> and its approximation <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> by the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). The uncertainty of our measurements of (<italic>T</italic>  −  <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>) spans between a minimum of 0.25 mK near 247 K and a maximum of 0.89 mK at the freezing point of indium (429.75 K) with comparable contributions from the uncertainty of our acoustic determination of <italic>T</italic> and from the uncertainty of our laboratory realization of ITS-90. On the overlapping temperature ranges these results are consistent with other recent acoustic determinations of (<italic>T</italic>  −  <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>). We also present evidence that (<italic>T</italic>  −  <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>) can be determined with comparably small uncertainties by the alternative, time-saving procedure of measuring the speed-of-sound in helium using only a single, judiciously-chosen, pressure on each isotherm.</p>
