abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report speed of sound measurements in helium at 273.16 K
    and at eight temperatures in the range between 236 K and 430 K. These results
    determine the difference (T  −  T<sub>90</sub>) between the thermodynamic temperature
    T and its approximation T<sub>90</sub> by the International Temperature Scale
    of 1990 (ITS-90). The uncertainty of our measurements of (T  −  T<sub>90</sub>)
    spans between a minimum of 0.25 mK near 247 K and a maximum of 0.89 mK at the
    freezing point of indium (429.75 K) with comparable contributions from the uncertainty
    of our acoustic determination of T and from the uncertainty of our laboratory
    realization of ITS-90. On the overlapping temperature ranges these results are
    consistent with other recent acoustic determinations of (T  −  T<sub>90</sub>).
    We also present evidence that (T  −  T<sub>90</sub>) can be determined with comparably
    small uncertainties by the alternative, time-saving procedure of measuring the
    speed-of-sound in helium using only a single, judiciously-chosen, pressure on
    each isotherm.</p>
