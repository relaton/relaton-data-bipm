abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The most common method to measure direct current high voltage
    (HV) down to the ppm-level is to use resistive high-voltage dividers. Such devices
    scale the HV into a range where it can be compared with precision digital voltmeters
    to reference voltages sources, which can be traced back to Josephson voltage standards.
    So far the calibration of the scale factors of HV dividers for voltages above
    1 kV could only be done at metrology institutes and sometimes involves round-robin
    tests among several institutions to get reliable results. Here we present a novel
    absolute calibration method based on the measurement of a differential scale factor,
    which can be performed with commercial equipment and outside metrology institutes.
    We demonstrate that reproducible measurements up to 35 kV can be performed with
    relative uncertainties below. This method is not restricted to metrology institutes
    and offers the possibility to determine the linearity of high-voltage dividers
    for a wide range of applications.</p>
