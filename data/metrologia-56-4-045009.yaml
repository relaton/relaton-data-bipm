abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In several disciplines, measurement results occasionally are
    expressed using coverage intervals that are asymmetric relative to the measured
    value. The conventional treatment of such results, when there is the need to propagate
    their uncertainties to derivative quantities, is to replace the asymmetric uncertainties
    by ‘symmetrized’ versions thereof. We show that such simplification is unnecessary,
    illustrate how asymmetry may be modeled and recognized explicitly, and propagated
    using standard Monte Carlo methods. We present three distributions (Fechner, skew-normal,
    and generalized extreme value), among many available alternatives, that can be
    used as models for asymmetric uncertainties associated with scalar input quantities,
    in the context of the measurement model considered in the GUM. We provide an example
    where such uncertainties are propagated to the uncertainty of a ratio of mass
    fractions. We also show how a similar, model-based approach can be used in the
    context of data reductions from interlaboratory studies and other consensus building
    exercises where the reported uncertainties are expressed asymmetrically, illustrating
    the approach to obtain consensus estimates of the absorption cross-section of
    ozone, and of the distance to galaxy M83 in the Virgo cluster.</p>
