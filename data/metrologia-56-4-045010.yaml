abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A laser diode-based flowmeter based on the infrared absorption
    method that can measure in situ micro flow rates from 0.2 to 20 ml h<sup>−1</sup>
    was developed. A 1450 nm laser absorbed in water was irradiated to form a heated
    spot at 0 mm, and the temperature was measured upstream and downstream of the
    heated spot. The flow rate was measured by the temperature difference obtained
    by two diode lasers and photodetectors upstream and downstream of the heated spot.
    We measured the temperature profile of the flow rate by changing the temperature
    measurement position and the heating laser energy upstream and downstream of the
    heated spot, and compared the measurements with the simulation results. As the
    flow rate increased, the temperature profile shifted downstream, and the measured
    temperature upstream and downstream were analyzed according to the flow rate.
    The flow measurement range was adjusted according to the temperature measurement
    position. Increasing the energy of the heating laser also improved the measurement
    accuracy in the lower flow range. The developed flowmeter was calibrated by the
    gravimetric method, and the deviation and measurement uncertainty according to
    the flow rate were obtained. The maximum measurement uncertainty was 6.8% at a
    1 ml h<sup>−1</sup> flow rate, and the minimum measurement uncertainty was 1.78%
    at 8 ml h<sup>−1</sup>. Thus, it was confirmed that the flow rate can be measured
    through the temperature difference gauged using a simple diode laser set. Using
    the laser diode-based flowmeter developed in this study, one can measure the flow
    rate in situ without injecting contaminants, such as particles, for measurements
    without cutting the piping. In addition, it can be manufactured in a miniaturized
    form at a low cost, and thus, it can be used for multi-drug infusion analysis,
    semiconductor process monitoring, etc.</p>
