abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization (O-DNP) can significantly
    boost the intensity of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal in comparison
    to the thermal magnetization for field strengths in the microtesla range. We demonstrate
    the development and use of an Overhauser spin-echo magnetometer using a superconducting
    quantum interference device-based microtesla NMR system and dissolved nitroxide
    radicals in deoxygenated tetramethylsilane liquid. A spin-echo train with an enhanced
    signal was successfully obtained with the O-DNP technique. A magnetic field strength
    of about 0.92 T was measured with an uncertainty of 0.7 pT in the presence of
    a field gradient of 0.038 T cm<sup>−1</sup>. The Overhauser proton spin-echo magnetometer
    will be useful for the measurement of low magnetic fields by minimizing the generation
    of disturbing magnetic fields without the need to compensate for residual field
    gradients.</p>
