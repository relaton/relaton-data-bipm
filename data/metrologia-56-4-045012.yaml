    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report on the realization and evaluation of the <sup>85</sup>Rb mobile atom absolute gravimeter named WAG-H5-1. With a distinctive Raman laser implementation, two new systematic errors, ac Stark shift imbalance and Raman laser chirp, are found and evaluated. The robustness of the instrument was tested during 1200 km-long transportation for the 10th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters at Beijing in October 2017. We acquire the degree of equivalence of 3 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab2f01ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>Gal after the comparison. Its performance was further assessed by comparing with an absolute gravimeter (FG5X) in Wuhan. With high mobility and environmental adaptability, the gravimeter reaches a sensitivity of 30 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab2f01ieqn002.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>Gal (Hz)<sup>−1/2</sup>, stability of 1 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab2f01ieqn003.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>Gal@ 4000 s and accuracy within 10 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab2f01ieqn004.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>Gal.</p>
