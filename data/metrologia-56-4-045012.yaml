abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the realization and evaluation of the<sup>85</sup>Rb
    mobile atom absolute gravimeter named WAG-H5-1. With a distinctive Raman laser
    implementation, two new systematic errors, ac Stark shift imbalance and Raman
    laser chirp, are found and evaluated. The robustness of the instrument was tested
    during 1200 km-long transportation for the 10th International Comparison of Absolute
    Gravimeters at Beijing in October 2017. We acquire the degree of equivalence of
    3 Gal after the comparison. Its performance was further assessed by comparing
    with an absolute gravimeter (FG5X) in Wuhan. With high mobility and environmental
    adaptability, the gravimeter reaches a sensitivity of 30 Gal (Hz)<sup>âˆ’1/2</sup>,
    stability of 1 Gal@ 4000 s and accuracy within 10 Gal.</p>
