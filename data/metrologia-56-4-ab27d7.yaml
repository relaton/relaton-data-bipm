abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The status of angles within The International System of Units
    (SI) has long been a source of controversy and confusion. We address one specific
    but crucial issue, putting the case that the idea of angles necessarily being
    length ratios, and hence dimensionless, is not valid. By making a clear distinction
    between the definition of a quantity and the process of making a measurement of
    that quantity, we show that the usual arguments for angles being length ratios
    are problematic. An appreciation of this point should clear away a major obstacle
    preventing a more proper treatment of the angle problem.</p>
