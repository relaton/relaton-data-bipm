abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The health of their populations and efficient health care systems
    are of critical importance to the economic and social well-being of nations. Accurate
    and comparable peptide/protein measurements are required in support of diagnosis,
    prognosis, monitoring and treatment of widespread diseases (e.g. diabetes). The
    required consistency of measurement results can be achieved by making them traceable
    to stated references and through the development of Reference Measurement Systems.
    The review mainly concentrates on the progress made in the Protein Analysis Working
    Group of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry
    and Biology (CCQM-PAWG) in establishing Primary Calibration Reference Services
    in the emerging area of health markers such as peptides/proteins. Primary Calibration
    Reference Services are technical capabilities for composition assignment, commonly
    as the mass fraction content, of pure substances or solutions thereof. It is a
    core technical competency for National Measurement Institutes (NMIs). A limited
    number of key comparisons, foreseen by the CCQM-PAWG strategy, are discussed that
    enable NMIs providing measurement services in peptide/protein analysis to test
    and demonstrate their capabilities. In addition, the review examines the development
    and improvement of analytical methods and metrological models that are required
    to meet the needs of NMIs and associated clinical stakeholders.</p>'
