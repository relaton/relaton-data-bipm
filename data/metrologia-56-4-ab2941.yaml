abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The precision of optically based techniques for long term CO<sub>2</sub>
    monitoring in the atmosphere is approaching the  ±0.02 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> level,
    however biases of potentially up to fifteen times greater than this can arise
    due to differences in isotopic composition of sample and calibration gases used.
    We have developed and describe a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
    method for CO<sub>2</sub> mole fraction measurements, using an instrument configured
    with a liquid N<sub>2</sub>-cooled mid-infrared indium antimonide (InSb) detector
    and a 10.01 m multipass Whitetype gas cell (0.75 l) and fitting of the<sup>12</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub>
    isotopologue absorption in the wavenumber region (3500–3800) cm<sup>−1</sup> where
    the measurement bias resulting from isotopic variation between sample and calibration
    gases can be corrected for. The method was completed with a comprehensive uncertainty
    budget from which considerations on the importance of spectroscopic specific biases
    could be deduced. The method was validated using 29 standards produced by 15 National
    Metrology Institutes/Designated Institutes, including the Central and a Regional
    Calibration Laboratory (McClenny  et al  2002  J. Air Waste Manag. Assoc.  52  542–62)
    from the World Meteorological Organization (2011 WMO/TD-No. 1560, Ed.: Hohenpeissenberg
    Metrological Observatory), with  δ<sup>13</sup>C values in CO<sub>2</sub> ranging
    from  −0.4‰ to  −67‰ versus VPDB. The standards were all produced with CO<sub>2</sub>
    mole fractions typical of background atmosphere calibration gases (either 380
    µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> or 480 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup>), and reference values for
    each of them were established during a comparison performed with a GC-FID analyzer,
    insensitive to their isotopic composition. Measurements have confirmed that a
    Δ δ<sup>13</sup>C of 1‰ between sample and calibration gases can bias the CO<sub>2</sub>
    mole fraction measurements made by FTIR by 4 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> and a Δ δ<sup>18</sup>O
    of 1‰ by 2 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. These biases can be corrected with the method
    described here, allowing FTIR based measurements of the CO<sub>2</sub> mole fraction
    with standard uncertainties reaching 0.05 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to be achieved,
    even if sample and calibration gases isotopic ratios differ. These findings have
    significant implications for the use of CO<sub>2</sub> calibration mixtures in
    particular for the atmospheric community, when high accuracy measurements are
    required.</p>'
