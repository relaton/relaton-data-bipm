abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, we propose a real-time free-running time scale
    based on four remote hydrogen masers. The clocks in the ensemble were scattered
    around Beijing, connected by urban fiber links using a novel frequency synchronization
    system. The remote clock ensemble prevents the time scale from potential problems
    caused by correlation among co-located clocks. Insofar as it is real-time, it
    fulfills the requirements for applications such as navigation, telecommunications
    and so on. The free-running time scale is updated every 1200 s, and a disturbance-resistant
    algorithm makes it robust to fiber link disturbances and clock malfunctions. The
    results of a continuous experiment over 224 d are reported. The stability of the
    time scale outperformed any clock in the ensemble for averaging times of more
    than approximately 10<sup>4</sup> s.</p>
