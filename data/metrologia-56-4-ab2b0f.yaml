abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this work we describe the spectral purity transfer between
    a 1156 nm ultrastable laser and a 1542 nm diode laser by means of an Er:fiber
    multibranch comb. By using both the master laser light at 1156 nm and its second-harmonic
    at 578 nm, together with the 1542 nm slave laser, we investigate the residual
    noise between the main comb output, the octave-spanning output, and a wavelength
    conversion module including non-linear fibers, second-harmonic generation crystal
    and amplifiers. With an ultimate stability of the system at the level of  at 1
    s and accuracy of, this configuration can sustain spectral transfer at the level
    required by the contemporary optical clocks with a simple and robust setup.</p>
