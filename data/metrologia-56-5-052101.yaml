    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The signal recorded in absolute ballistic gravimeters and used to track the trajectory of the free-falling corner-cube was recently studied for the first time in full agreement with relativistic effects. The outcome was an original phase-time equation describing the optical interference as a function of initial position, initial speed, dimensions and refractive index of the corner-cube. This offers the unique possibility to check possible systematic errors affecting data collected using the conventional position-time equation coupled to the debated ‘speed of light’ correction. To this aim, I simulated and processed threshold-crossing times anticipated by the phase-time equation in typical experimental conditions of working gravimeters. In addition, the fictitious condition when a mirror replaces the corner-cube is investigated to probe the significant correction suggested by the developer of the phase-time equation. The results are given in terms of position and gravity acceleration errors.</p>
