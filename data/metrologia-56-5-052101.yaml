abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The signal recorded in absolute ballistic gravimeters and used
    to track the trajectory of the free-falling corner-cube was recently studied for
    the first time in full agreement with relativistic effects. The outcome was an
    original phase-time equation describing the optical interference as a function
    of initial position, initial speed, dimensions and refractive index of the corner-cube.
    This offers the unique possibility to check possible systematic errors affecting
    data collected using the conventional position-time equation coupled to the debated
    ‘speed of light’ correction. To this aim, I simulated and processed threshold-crossing
    times anticipated by the phase-time equation in typical experimental conditions
    of working gravimeters. In addition, the fictitious condition when a mirror replaces
    the corner-cube is investigated to probe the significant correction suggested
    by the developer of the phase-time equation. The results are given in terms of
    position and gravity acceleration errors.</p>
