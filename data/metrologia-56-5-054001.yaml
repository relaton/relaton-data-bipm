abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Newtonian constant of gravitation, G, stands out in the
    landscape of the most common fundamental constants owing to its surprisingly large
    relative uncertainty, which is attributable mostly to the dispersion of the values
    measured for it by different methods and in different experiments, each of which
    may have rather small relative uncertainty.</p><p>This study focuses on a set
    of measurements of G comprising results published very recently as well as older
    results, some of which have been corrected since the original publication. This
    set is inconsistent, in the sense that the dispersion of the measured values is
    significantly larger than what their reported uncertainties suggest that it should
    be. Furthermore, there is a loosely defined group of measured values that lie
    fairly close to a consensus value that may reasonably be derived from all the
    measurement results, and then there are one or more groups with measured values
    farther away from the consensus value, some appreciably higher, others lower.</p><p>This
    same general pattern is often observed in many other interlaboratory studies and
    meta-analyses. In the conventional treatments of such data, the mutual inconsistency
    is addressed by inflating the reported uncertainties, either multiplicatively,
    or by the addition of ‘random effects’, both reflecting the presence of dark uncertainty.
    The former approach is often used by CODATA and by the Particle Data Group, and
    the latter is common in medical meta-analysis and in metrology. However, both
    achieve consistency ignoring how the measured values are arranged relative to
    the consensus value, and measured values close to the consensus value often tend
    to be penalized excessively, by such ‘extra’ uncertainty.</p><p>We propose a new
    procedure for consensus building that models the results using latent clusters
    with different shades of dark uncertainty, which assigns a customized amount of
    dark uncertainty to each measured value, as a mixture of those shades, and does
    so taking into account both the placement of the measured values relative to the
    consensus value, and the reported uncertainties. We demonstrate this procedure
    by deriving a new estimate for G, as a consensus value m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>
    s<sup>−2</sup>, with m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−2</sup>.</p>
