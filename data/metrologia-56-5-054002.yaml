abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>It has been recognized for a long time that nuclear magnetic
    resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used for quantification; the resonance peak
    area is known to be proportional to the number of nuclei contributing to the peak.
    However, quantification by Fourier transformation (FT) NMR was believed to be
    only accurate to within a few percent to 10%, and in general, analytical chemists
    thought the level of accuracy was not satisfactory. However, about 20 years ago,
    chemical metrologists began to recognize the usefulness of quantitative applications
    of NMR for determining the purity of organic materials. Here, we present a brief
    review on purity assessment of the quantitative NMR (qNMR) and its contribution
    to the consultative committee for amount of substance: metrology in chemistry
    and biology (CCQM) working group on organic analysis (OAWG).</p>'
