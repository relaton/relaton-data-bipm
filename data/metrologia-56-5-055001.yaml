abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a method for characterising spatial responsivity
    of hyperspectral cameras. Knowing the responsivity of the camera as a function
    of pixel coordinates allows applying a flat-field correction on image data. The
    method is based on scanning the field of view of the camera with a broadband radiance
    source, based on an integrating sphere, and combining the captured frames to synthesise
    a uniform radiance source filling the whole field of view of the camera at the
    focus distance. The method was compared with a traditional approach where the
    aperture of an integrating sphere is imaged from a close distance, filling the
    entire field of view of the camera. The measurement setup was tested with a hyperspectral
    camera, based on a tunable Fabry–Pérot interferometer. Without the flat-field
    correction, the average standard deviation of the pixel responsivities across
    all the spectral channels of the camera was 3.78%. After the correction, the average
    standard deviation was reduced to 0.40% and 3.25% for the aperture-scanning method
    and the close-distance method, respectively. The expanded uncertainty (k  =  2)
    for the flat-field correction obtained using the scanning method was 0.68%–0.78%,
    depending on the spectral channel of the camera.</p>
