abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Uncertainty propagation software can have unknown, inadvertent
    biases introduced by various means. This work treats bias identification and reduction
    in one such software package, the microwave uncertainty framework (MUF). The MUF
    provides automated multivariate statistical uncertainty propagation and analysis
    on a Monte Carlo (MC) basis. is a key module in the MUF, responsible for merging
    data, raw or transformed, to accurately reflect the variability in the data and
    in its central tendency. In this work the performance of ’s MC replicates is analytically
    compared against its stated design goals. An alternative construction is proposed
    for ’s MC replicates and its performance is compared, too, against ’s design goals.
    These comparisons reveal that ’s MC uncertainty results with the current construction
    method are biased except under restrictive conditions. The bias with the proposed
    alternative construction, by contrast, is, without restriction, asymptotically
    zero (in the large MC sample size limit), and this construction is recommended.</p>
