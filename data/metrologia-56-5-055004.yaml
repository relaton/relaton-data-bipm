abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When laser beams are used for length measurements by interferometry
    and the realisation of the meter, they are approximated by plane waves. Hence,
    from the measured frequency, the dispersion relation of plane waves gives the
    wavelength in a vacuum and, consequently, the period of the interference signal.
    However, this relation does not hold exactly and the wavelength is not a well-defined
    quantity. Aberrations of the wavefront and intensity profile bias the phase accumulation
    and originate measurement errors. This paper gives the corrections for the period
    of the integrated interference of aberrated paraxial beams.</p>
