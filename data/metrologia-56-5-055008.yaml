abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Relative humidity in upper air is frequently measured using
    radiosondes at an altitude of up to roughly 35 km. In this study, the calibration
    of a radiosonde humidity sensor was demonstrated using a humidity generator that
    can mimic the humidity, temperature, and pressure conditions in upper air. The
    calibration of the radiosonde humidity sensor was conducted in terms of relative
    humidity at a temperature range of  −70 °C to 20 °C, and at a pressure range of
    5 kPa to 101 kPa. Consequently, it was revealed that the radiosonde humidity sensor
    presents a significant temperature dependency in such a way that indicates lower
    humidity values than the reference values measured by the generator as temperature
    is lowered. The deviation from the reference humidity was measured at about 30%rh
    at  −70 °C. However, the effect of low pressure (5 kPa) on the sensor measurement
    was less than 1%rh. The uncertainty budget on the calibration of the radiosonde
    humidity sensor, including factors due to humidity generation, correction of temperature
    effect, pressure effect, and sensor reproducibility, are presented. Consequently,
    the calibration uncertainty of the humidity sensor was 3.8%rh at the coverage
    factor k  =  2. The calibration capability of the radiosonde humidity sensor demonstrated
    in this study will provide traceability to the International System of Units (SI)
    in the humidity measurement in upper air.</p>
