abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two types of high-temperature fixed points (HTFPs) were evaluated
    by VNIIOFI, NIM, KRISS and NMIJ. WC–C peritectic point cells manufactured independently
    in different National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) were compared for the first
    time, and agreement of the melting temperatures for three high-quality cells at
    the level of 0.05 °C was demonstrated. This confirms, in conjunction with previous
    results that verified their long-term stability, high repeatability and reproducibility,
    the high potential of the WC–C cell as the highest-temperature reference point
    for radiation thermometry.</p><p>The performance of the Ru–C eutectic fixed point
    was verified by evaluating Ru–C cells manufactured from 99.999% purity Ru materials
    from different manufacturers. These cells used considerably purer materials than
    those used in previous studies. New Ru–C cells were constructed from the best
    performing materials, and the t<sub>90</sub> values of these cells were measured
    at the four NMIs on their locally-realized ITS-90 scale. The values agreed within
    0.25 °C among the four NMIs, and the t<sub>90</sub> value of Ru–C was determined
    to be 1953.64 °C with an expanded uncertainty of 0.20 °C. Both results confirmed
    that performance of WC–C and of Ru–C is comparable to or exceeds that of the HTFPs
    evaluated in the Consultative Committee for Thermometry’s HTFP project, and both
    fixed points have capability as a reference fixed points to be included in the
    future MeP-K in terms of thermodynamic temperature T.</p>
