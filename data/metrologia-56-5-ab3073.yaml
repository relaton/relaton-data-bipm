abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The question of how to relate particle sizes measured using
    a fixed-angle dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument with those measured using
    a multi-angle DLS instrument is addressed. A series of nearly monodisperse polystyrene
    latex (PSL) particles with nominal diameters of 100 nm, 70 nm, 50 nm, and 30 nm
    were measured using two different types of DLS instruments: one owned by the National
    Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) of the multi-angle type and the other owned
    by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the fixed-angle
    type. The mean particle size of the PSL particles was measured using the multi-angle-type
    instrument at various scattering angles and at various concentrations of particle
    suspension. These data were used to establish the functional dependence of the
    measured particle size on the scattering angle and particle concentration through
    the least-squares fitting method. The established function was then used to predict
    the mean particle sizes that would have been obtained if the same scattering angle
    and particle concentrations as those used at NIST had been selected at NMIJ. The
    mean particle sizes obtained at NIST and at NMIJ agreed quite well for all four
    PSL particle samples after compensating for the angle and concentration differences.
    The result of this study clearly demonstrates that consideration for the dependence
    of measured particle sizes on the scattering angle and particle concentration
    is crucial in intra-method comparisons of mean particle sizes obtained using DLS.</p>'
