abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The assumption that the reflectance of white diffuse reflectance
    standards is identical to that of the perfect reflecting diffuser (PRD) allows
    these standards to be used to characterize reflectance or radiance factors of
    any surface at any irradiation/collection geometry simply by comparison. However,
    this assumption is only true within certain limits, and, for some applications,
    requirements may be out of those limits. PTB and IO-CSIC have studied the variation
    of the reflectance with respect to the bidirectional geometry for the four most
    typical white diffuse materials (barium sulfate, opal glass, ceramic and Spectralon),
    at in- and out-of plane geometries and at spectral range from 380 nm to 1700 nm.
    We have defined descriptors in order to more clearly quantify the spectral reflectance
    variation with the bidirectional geometries. The values obtained for these descriptors
    have been separately presented for the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges.
    In both spectral ranges, deviations of white diffuse reflectance standards with
    respect to the PRD were found, regarding both Lambertian behaviour and spectral
    constancy. The observed deviation from the BRDF is in general very large for high
    incidence and collection angles (reaching in many cases 20%). Therefore, it is
    not possible to assume Lambertianity in standards at those geometries when calibrating
    measuring systems.</p>
