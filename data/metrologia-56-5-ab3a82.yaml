abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The current SI second based on the atomic hyperfine transition
    in the ground state of<sup>133</sup>Cs is expected to be replaced by a new definition
    based on optical frequency standards, whose estimated uncertainty has now been
    established two orders of magnitude lower than the accuracy of the best Cs primary
    standards. However, such a redefinition of the second is hindered by the fact
    that many atomic species are potential contenders to become the new primary frequency
    standard. In this paper, we propose to resolve this issue by defining a composite
    frequency unit based on the weighted geometric mean of the individual frequencies
    of different atomic transitions. This unit has the property to be realisable with
    any single clock whose transition composes the unit, provided that at least a
    few frequency ratios are available, with an accuracy that marginally differs from
    the nominal clock uncertainty. We show that the unit can be updated as the performances
    of the contributing transitions evolve, without incurring a drift on the unit
    itself.</p>
