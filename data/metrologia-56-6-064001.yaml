abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The evaluation of seven internal standard reference materials
    (ISRMs) to act as a ‘universal’ SI-traceable calibrator suite for organic compound
    purity determination by quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy
    is described. The set of compounds demonstrated to constitute such a suite are:
    potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP), maleic acid (MA), 3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl
    benzoic acid (BTFMBA), dimethyl sulfone (DMSO<sub>2</sub>), dimethyl terephthalate
    (DMTP), 1,4-bis-trimethlsilyl benzene (BTMSB or BTMSB-d<sub>4</sub>) and perdeuterated
    sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-1-propanesulfonate (DSS-d<sub>6</sub>). The compounds
    were selected such that at least one ISRM should be suitable for use as the internal
    standard for the qNMR purity assignment of an organic compound soluble in a given
    deuterated solvent. They allow for the selection for use as the internal reference
    for quantitative integration from a set of simple, sharp NMR signals dispersed
    over the proton chemical shift range.</p><p>Optimized conditions for acquiring
    qNMR spectra were developed and are described, as well as the results of an extensive
    series of studies validating the use of the ISRM suite to assign mass fraction
    values in four representative solvents (D<sub>2</sub>O, DMSO-d<sub>6</sub>, CD<sub>3</sub>OD
    and CDCl<sub>3</sub>). Proper use and application of these ISRMs result in standard
    uncertainties in the assigned values of the analyte of interest of the order of
    1 mg g<sup>−1</sup> in optimal cases. These materials are of particular interest
    for the mass fraction purity determinations by qNMR of organic compound reference
    materials required as analyte specific calibrators to underpin the SI-traceability
    of the results for routine laboratory analysis based on techniques such as gas
    and liquid chromatography.</p>'
