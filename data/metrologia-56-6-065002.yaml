    <title>Abstract:</title>
    <p>This work presents precision measurements of quantized Hall array resistance devices using superconducting, crossover-free and multiple interconnections as well as graphene split contacts. These new techniques successfully eliminate the accumulation of internal resistances and leakage currents that typically occur at interconnections and crossing leads between interconnected devices. As a result, a scalable quantized Hall resistance array is obtained with a nominal value that is as precise and stable as that from single-element quantized Hall resistance standards.</p>
