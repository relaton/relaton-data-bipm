abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper studies the use of multiple GNSS constellations for
    time transfer. The performances of each constellation are compared to one another.
    We show that, with its current constellation, Galileo already provides time transfer
    results with the same or better performances than GPS, for which some time links
    are affected by a diurnal variation. The paper also investigates different ways
    of combining the constellations into one global time transfer solution. We show
    that in a global AV solution, only one constellation should be calibrated, due
    to the inherent inter-system biases in the multi-GNSS clock products. Our results
    show that the best combination is to use the Galileo solution as a reference,
    and to combine the observations applying one bias (with respect to Galileo) per
    satellite of the other constellations. This allows reducing the impact of diurnal
    variations present in some GPS clock solutions. Combining Galileo and GPS satellites
    in this way improves the time transfer link with respect to the GPS-only or Galileo-only
    solutions. Adding moreover BeiDou-2 and GLONASS satellites gives, depending on
    the link, a solution similar or worse than the solution obtained from GPS and
    Galileo.</p>
