abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on an improved systematic evaluation of the JILA SrI
    optical lattice clock, achieving a nearly identical uncertainty compared to the
    previous strontium record set by the JILA SrII optical lattice clock at. This
    improves upon the previous evaluation of the JILA SrI optical lattice clock in
    2013, and we achieve a more than twenty-fold reduction in systematic uncertainty
    to. A seven-fold improvement in clock stability, reaching for an averaging time
    in seconds, allows the clock to average to its systematic uncertainty in under
    10 min. We improve the systematic uncertainty budget in several important ways.
    This includes a novel scheme for taming blackbody radiation-induced frequency
    shifts through active stabilization and characterization of the thermal environment,
    inclusion of higher-order terms in the lattice light shift, and updated atomic
    coefficients. Along with careful control of other systematic effects, we achieve
    low temporal drift of systematic offsets and high uptime of the clock. We additionally
    present an improved evaluation of the second order Zeeman coefficient that is
    applicable to all Sr optical lattice clocks. These improvements in performance
    have enabled several important studies including frequency ratio measurements
    through the boulder area clock optical network (BACON), a high precision comparison
    with the JILA 3D lattice clock, a demonstration of a new all-optical time scale
    combining SrI and a cryogenic silicon cavity, and a high sensitivity search for
    ultralight scalar dark matter.</p>
