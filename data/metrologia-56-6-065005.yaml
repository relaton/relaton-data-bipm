abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Hyperspectral cameras capture the spectral power distribution
    of the objects in the imaged view via dozens of narrow-band spectral channels
    of the camera. Knowledge of the spectral responsivity of the channels is essential
    when interpreting the acquired hyperspectral data and assessing its reliability.
    The spectral responsivity of the camera channels may vary within the image area.
    This paper presents a measurement setup and data analysis routine for characterising
    the spectral responsivity of a hyperspectral camera. This method was used to characterise
    the spectral responsivity of a Fabry–Pérot-interferometer-based hyperspectral
    camera. The characterisation method implemented in this study was able to reveal
    several channel leaks in the measured wavelength range. In the image area there
    is an approximately 1.5 nm shift in the channel wavelengths, and up to 10% variation
    in the channel bandwidths. The expanded uncertainties (k  =  2) for the measured
    channel bandwidths, sensitivities and wavelengths were 7.9%, 9.5% and 0.64 nm,
    respectively.</p>
