abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, we discuss the effects of loading mass deformation
    and contact stiffness by giving various mass loadings in high-frequency primary
    calibration of the back-to-back accelerometer up to 20â€‰kHz. The experimental contradiction
    of sensitivity and phase shift with respect to the mass loading effect described
    in the international standard document ISO 16063-11 indicates that there is no
    deformation of the loading mass, but only the effect of contact stiffness. In
    order to explain the validity of the contact stiffness according to the experimental
    results, it was verified by using a physical model and the finite element method
    with COMSOL software. As a result, the screw-joint function of the screw in the
    software agreed with the experimental result concerning the contact stiffness.</p>
