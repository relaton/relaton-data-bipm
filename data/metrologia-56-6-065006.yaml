    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this paper, we discuss the effects of loading mass deformation and contact stiffness by giving various mass loadings in high-frequency primary calibration of the back-to-back accelerometer up to 20â€‰kHz. The experimental contradiction of sensitivity and phase shift with respect to the mass loading effect described in the international standard document ISO 16063-11 indicates that there is no deformation of the loading mass, but only the effect of contact stiffness. In order to explain the validity of the contact stiffness according to the experimental results, it was verified by using a physical model and the finite element method with COMSOL software. As a result, the screw-joint function of the screw in the software agreed with the experimental result concerning the contact stiffness.</p>
