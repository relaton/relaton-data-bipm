abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Accurate determination of the bidirectional transmittance distribution
    function (BTDF) of transmissive diffusers is critical for the on-orbit spectral
    radiance calibration of several satellite-based, Earth remote sensing instruments.
    This study presents the results of the comparison of BTDF measurements by NASA
    Goddard Space Flight Center’s Diffuser Calibration Laboratory and the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology’s Spectral Tri-function Automated Reference
    Reflectometer facility on two transmissive diffusers: HOD-500, a synthetic fused
    silica sample manufactured by Hereaus Quarzglas, and Spectralon-250, a sintered
    polytetrafluoroethylene sample manufactured by Labsphere, Incorporated. BTDF measurements
    were acquired at seven wavelengths from 290 nm to 740 nm, at incident elevation
    angles of 0° and 30°, and at scatter elevation angles from 1° to 15°. Comparison
    of the measurements made by the two facilities revealed excellent agreement within
    their combined standard uncertainties. NASA chose the parameters for the BTDF
    measurements to be identical to those NASA used when measuring the BTDF of the
    flight diffusers to be flown onboard the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of
    Pollution (TEMPO) and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS)
    satellite instruments. Successful agreement between NASA and NIST of BTDF results,
    therefore, effectively validates the BTDF measurements NASA made for these satellite
    flight programs.</p>'
