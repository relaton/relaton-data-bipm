    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Accurate determination of the bidirectional transmittance distribution function (BTDF) of transmissive diffusers is critical for the on-orbit spectral radiance calibration of several satellite-based, Earth remote sensing instruments. This study presents the results of the comparison of BTDF measurements by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Diffuser Calibration Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Spectral Tri-function Automated Reference Reflectometer facility on two transmissive diffusers: HOD-500, a synthetic fused silica sample manufactured by Hereaus Quarzglas, and Spectralon-250, a sintered polytetrafluoroethylene sample manufactured by Labsphere, Incorporated. BTDF measurements were acquired at seven wavelengths from 290 nm to 740 nm, at incident elevation angles of 0° and 30°, and at scatter elevation angles from 1° to 15°. Comparison of the measurements made by the two facilities revealed excellent agreement within their combined standard uncertainties. NASA chose the parameters for the BTDF measurements to be identical to those NASA used when measuring the BTDF of the flight diffusers to be flown onboard the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) and the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) satellite instruments. Successful agreement between NASA and NIST of BTDF results, therefore, effectively validates the BTDF measurements NASA made for these satellite flight programs.</p>
