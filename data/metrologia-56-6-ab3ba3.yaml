abstract:
- content: Abstract:<p>This work presents precision measurements of quantized Hall
    array resistance devices using superconducting, crossover-free and multiple interconnections
    as well as graphene split contacts. These new techniques successfully eliminate
    the accumulation of internal resistances and leakage currents that typically occur
    at interconnections and crossing leads between interconnected devices. As a result,
    a scalable quantized Hall resistance array is obtained with a nominal value that
    is as precise and stable as that from single-element quantized Hall resistance
    standards.</p>
