abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The article analyzes the arguments that have become the basis
    for the 1980 CIPM recommendations declaring plane and solid angles as dimensionless
    derived quantities. This decision was the result of an incorrect interpretation
    of mathematical relationships that connect the ratio of two lengths with the plane
    angle, and the ratio of area to square of length with the solid angle. The analysis
    of these relationships, presented in the article, showed that they determine neither
    the dimensions of the angles nor their units, but only the numerical values of
    the angles expressed in radians and steradians. It is shown that the series expansions
    of trigonometric functions sometimes used to prove the dimensionless character
    of the plane angle is also incorrect because in this case the trigonometric functions
    of two different types, independent of each other, are offen confused. It is established
    that the plane angle is an independent quantity and therefore should be assigned
    to the base quantities and its unit, the radian, should be added to the base SI
    units. It is shown that the solid angle is the derived quantity of a plane angle.
    Its unit, the steradian, is a coherent derived unit equal to the square radian.</p>
