abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The paper firstly argues from conservation principles that,
    when dealing with physics aside from elementary particle interactions, the number
    of naturally independent quantities, and hence the minimum number of base quantities
    within a unit system, is five. These can be, for example, mass, charge, length,
    time, and angle. It also highlights the benefits of expressing the laws of physics
    using equations that are invariant when the size of the chosen unit for any of
    these base quantities is changed. Following the pioneering work in this area by
    Buckingham, these are termed ‘complete’ equations, in contrast with equations
    that require a specific unit to be used. Using complete equations is shown to
    remove much ambiguity and confusion, especially where angles are involved. As
    an example, some quantities relating to atomic frequencies are clarified. Also,
    the reduced Planck constant  ħ,  as commonly used, is shown to represent two distinct
    quantities, one an action (energy x time), and the other an angular momentum (action/angle).
    There would be benefits in giving these two quantities different symbols. Lastly,
    the freedom to choose how base units are defined is shown to allow, in principle,
    measurements of changes over time to dimensional fundamental constants like  c.</p>
