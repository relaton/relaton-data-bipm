abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this work the most intense x-ray lines of the L-emission
    spectrum of gadolinium with respect to line energies, natural line widths, and
    relative transition probabilities were investigated using monochromatized synchrotron
    radiation. The measurements were realized in the PTB laboratory at BESSY II by
    means of an in-house built von Hamos spectrometer based on up to two full-cylinder
    HAPG mosaic crystals. The von Hamos spectrometer is calibrated by means of elastically
    scattered photons from the employed synchrotron radiation beamline leading to
    a well-defined energy scale and an experimentally determined spectrometer response.
    A selective excitation of the gadolinium L subshells was carried out to ensure
    a robust deconvolution of neighboring emission lines of different L subshells.
    The experimental results are discussed in the context of existing data from common
    databases and published values since significant deviations, especially for the
    L     and L     emission lines, are observed. We further substantiate and discuss
    two satellite lines at the low-energy side of the L     and L     emission lines
    arising from the N<sub>4,5</sub> subshell.</p>
