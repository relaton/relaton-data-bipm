abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Within the Working Group on Inorganic Analysis (IAWG) of the
    Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology
    (CCQM) international key comparisons and pilot studies related to inorganic analysis
    are carried to ensure consistency in this field at the highest level. Some of
    these comparisons deal directly with the preparation and characterization of monoelemental
    solutions or with topics, closely related. The importance of monoelemental solutions
    lies in the fact that almost every measurement in inorganic analysis relies on
    the comparison with either a reference material, or references in form of solutions,
    usually (mono)elemental solutions. All quantitative measurement approaches, e.g.
    isotope dilution or standard addition, need an accurate reference solution made
    from a well characterized reference material, prepared under full gravimetric
    control. These primary (monoelemental) solutions do not only serve as arbitrary
    references/calibration solutions, but they also link up measurement results to
    the International System of units (SI), this way establishing the so-called metrological
    traceability to a measurement unit of the SI. Without such solutions on the highest
    possible level of accuracy and with the smallest possible associated uncertainties
    (for e.g. element content and/or impurities), an analysis itself can never be
    as good as it could be with appropriate reference solutions. This article highlights
    select key comparisons and pilot studies dealing with monoelemental solution-related
    topics within the IAWG from the foundation of CCQM—25 years ago—up to latest achievements
    in the field of inorganic analysis.</p>'
