    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Within the <italic>Working Group on Inorganic Analysis (IAWG)</italic> of the <italic>Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM)</italic> international key comparisons and pilot studies related to inorganic analysis are carried to ensure consistency in this field at the highest level. Some of these comparisons deal directly with the preparation and characterization of monoelemental solutions or with topics, closely related. The importance of monoelemental solutions lies in the fact that almost every measurement in inorganic analysis relies on the comparison with either a reference material, or references in form of solutions, usually (mono)elemental solutions. All quantitative measurement approaches, e.g. isotope dilution or standard addition, need an accurate reference solution made from a well characterized reference material, prepared under full gravimetric control. These primary (monoelemental) solutions do not only serve as arbitrary references/calibration solutions, but they also link up measurement results to the International System of units (SI), this way establishing the so-called <italic>metrological traceability to a measurement unit of the SI</italic>. Without such solutions on the highest possible level of accuracy and with the smallest possible associated uncertainties (for e.g. element content and/or impurities), an analysis itself can never be as good as it could be with appropriate reference solutions. This article highlights select key comparisons and pilot studies dealing with monoelemental solution-related topics within the IAWG from the foundation of CCQM—25 years ago—up to latest achievements in the field of inorganic analysis.</p>
