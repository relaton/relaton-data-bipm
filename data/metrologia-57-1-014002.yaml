abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Radiation thermometry based on the measurement of two fixed
    points, the so-called n  =  2 scheme, is studied in this work. Verification of
    the scheme was undertaken for various measurement conditions using seven radiation
    thermometers with nominal centre wavelengths of 650 nm, 890 nm, 900 nm, and 1600 nm.
    Comparison between the signals calculated using the n  =  2 scheme and the signals
    measured directly with fixed-point cells was studied. For temperatures between
    the two reference fixed points, the equivalent temperature difference was less
    than 0.14 K in the temperature range from the In to Cu fixed points, and less
    than 0.3 K in the temperature range from the Cu to Re–C fixed points. The maximum
    normalised error was 0.35, confirming the validity of the n  =  2 scheme; the
    consistency was observed not only in the interpolation temperature range, but
    also in the extrapolation range. The results also indicate that temperature realisation
    in the range from 150 °C to 2500 °C can be achieved by maintaining only the Zn,
    Cu, and Re–C fixed-point facilities. The n  =  2 scheme would be of great benefit
    to developing national metrology institutes in terms of time consumed for scale
    realisation and cost for maintenance of the measurement system.</p>
