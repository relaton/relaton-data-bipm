abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This study determined the triple point temperature of sulfur
    hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), as well as the associated uncertainty, to evaluate
    the potential use of this value as an alternative to the triple point of mercury
    as a fixed point defined in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).
    The triple point temperature was obtained using an adiabatic calorimeter incorporating
    a sealed cell made from oxygen-free copper. The cell was filled with 99.9992%
    SF<sub>6</sub> and included three standard platinum resistance thermometers that
    had been calibrated at eight fixed points defined by the ITS-90 protocol. Applying
    a thermal treatment to the solidified sample prior to determining the triple point
    temperature was found to decrease the width of the melting curve. Based on melting
    curves acquired following this thermal treatment, the triple point temperature
    of SF<sub>6</sub> was found to be 223.556â€‰47(53) K. The temperature scale constructed
    using SF<sub>6</sub> was found to be consistent with that generated using mercury
    within a maximum deviation of 70 K from 13.8033 K to 273.16 K.</p>
