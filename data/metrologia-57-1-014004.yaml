abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), as a primary
    approach used to characterize SI (International System of Units)-traceable organic
    compounds, is based on the proportionality of intensities from analyte and standard,
    which implies a fundamental requirement that the peaks to be used for quantitation
    are isolated from impurities. Therefore, sufficient dispersion or a data analysis
    method has to be used to enable isolation of the peaks for quantitation of impurities.
    This technique offers many metrological advantages, though significant challenges
    associated with factors such as calibration reference materials, experimental
    parameter optimization and isolation of quantitative peaks must be considered
    to ensure confidence in the results. This review focuses on the development of
    advanced qNMR methods (including combined qNMR methods), especially those that
    enhance measurement selectivity and mitigate biases associated with chemical interferences,
    aiming to satisfy this requirement. For this aim, in recent years, different advanced
    qNMR approaches have been developed to remove interferences spatially, mathematically,
    spectroscopically, etc. The principles, advantages, challenges and future prospects
    of these approaches are introduced in this review. These advanced approaches aim
    to improve qNMR accuracy for analytes with molecular weight up to ~6000 g/mol.
    The approaches are aimed at removing potential systematic errors in qNMR to improve
    its trueness and its application as primary metrolgical method and routine analysis
    method.</p>
