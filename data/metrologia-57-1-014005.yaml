    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>For over a century the Type S (Pt-10%Rh) and R (Pt-13%Rh) thermocouples have been used as primary or secondary reference thermometers. However, the measurement uncertainties of both types at the silver point (~962 °C) are typically limited to about 0.5 °C, due to drift caused by crystallographic ordering between 200 °C and 500 °C and rhodium oxidation between 500 °C and 900 °C. Although both processes can be reversed using an 1100 °C anneal, regular annealing can be inconvenient or impracticable. This paper follows up a prior study indicating that an alternative noble-metal thermocouple comprised of Pt-20%Rh and Pt is relatively insensitive to both drift mechanisms. Four thermocouples, assembled using wire from four different manufacturers, were evaluated using a gradient-furnace and homogeneity scanner. Measurements were also made using a salt-bath (200 °C to 500 °C) and fixed points between the indium and silver points. The experiments indicate that individual thermocouples are stable at the silver point to within 0.18 °C for periods of up to 100 h and all four thermocouples have emf versus temperature characteristics within 0.3 °C of each other. This intrinsic stability and similarity, coupled with cost, assembly and use conditions identical to a Type R or S thermocouple make the Pt-20%Rh versus Pt thermocouple an attractive alternative. Recommended annealing procedures enabling the greatest stability are also given.</p>
