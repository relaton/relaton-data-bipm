abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Laser power metrology at the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) ranges 20 orders of magnitude from photon-counting (10<sup>3</sup>
    photons s<sup>−1</sup>) to 100 kW (10<sup>23</sup> photons s<sup>−1</sup> at a
    wavelength of 1070 nm). As a part of routine practices, we perform internal (unpublished)
    comparisons between our various power meters to verify correct operation. Here
    we use the results of these intercomparisons to demonstrate an unbroken chain
    tracing each power meter’s calibration factor to the NIST cryogenic radiometer
    (our lowest uncertainty standard, whose SI traceability is established through
    the volt and ohm units). This yields the expected result that all the NIST primary
    standard measurement techniques agree with each other to within their measurement
    uncertainty. Then, these intercomparison results are re-mapped to describe the
    agreement of the various techniques with our radiation-pressure-based power measurement
    approach, whose SI traceability is established through the kilogram. Again, agreement
    is demonstrated to within the measurement uncertainty. This agreement is reassuring
    because the measurements are compared with two entirely different traceability
    paths and show expected agreement in each case. The ramifications of this agreement
    as well as potential means to improve on it are discussed.</p><p>We demonstrate
    SI measurement traceability of our single-photon power measurement through the
    kilogram with less than 3% relative expanded uncertainty (obtained for a coverage
    factor k  =  2 defining an interval having a level of confidence of approximately
    95%).</p>
