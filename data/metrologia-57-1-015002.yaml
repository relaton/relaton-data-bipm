abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We measure the detection efficiency of single-photon detectors
    at wavelengths near 851 nm and 1533.6 nm. We investigate the spatial uniformity
    of one free-space-coupled single-photon avalanche diode and present a comparison
    between fusion-spliced and connectorized fiber-coupled single-photon detectors.
    We find that our expanded relative uncertainty for a single measurement of the
    detection efficiency is as low as 0.70% for fiber-coupled measurements at 1533.6 nm
    and as high as 1.78% for our free-space characterization at 851.7 nm. The detection-efficiency
    determination includes corrections for afterpulsing, dark count, and count-rate
    effects of the single-photon detector with the detection efficiency interpolated
    to operation at a specified detected count rate.</p>
