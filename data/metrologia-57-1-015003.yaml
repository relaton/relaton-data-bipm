abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency (QE) is one of the
    important parameters to characterize photoluminescent materials especially for
    lighting and display applications. Under a few assumptions, IEC standard (IEC62607-3-1)
    provides two methods of high simplicity and moderate accuracy with an integrating
    sphere for absolute measurement of QE named ‘collimated incident light method
    (CILM)’ and ‘diffuse incident light method (DILM)’, respectively (International
    standard IEC 62607-3-1 2014 Nanomanufactureing-Key Control Characteristics Part3-1:
    Luminescent Nanomaterials-Quantum Efficiency 1st edn (Geneva: International Electrotechnical
    Commission); de Mello et al 1997 Adv. Mater. 9 230–2). However, the simplification
    unavoidably causes systematic errors, which could be significant in certain cases
    of sphere reflectance or material properties. In this paper, we numerically investigate
    the systematic errors that can occur in the standardised methods when employing
    a Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation and also present the correction method based
    on additional measurement to estimate the diffusivity of the sample reflectance
    at excitation wavelength and absorption of the sample at PL emission wavelength.</p>'
