    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We performed a precise temperature measurement of the triple point of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which is one of the secondary reference points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS–90), using an adiabatic calorimeter with five capsule-type standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs). Impurity analyses showed that the purity of the CO<sub>2</sub> sample was 99.999 37%. A thermal treatment process before the realization of the triple point reduced the width of the melting curve of the triple point of CO<sub>2</sub> and increased the linearity of the melting curves with respect to the inverse of the melting fraction <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>. We determined the triple-point temperature of CO<sub>2</sub> at the liquidus point by extrapolating the six melting curves obtained after the thermal treatment process. The triple-point temperature of CO<sub>2</sub> measured in this work is 216.590 90 K <inline-formula>

                   </inline-formula> 0.36 mK (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>  =  1). This result indicates that the triple point of CO<sub>2</sub> can potentially be used as a fixed point based on the ITS–90 to replace the triple point of mercury.</p>
