abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We performed a precise temperature measurement of the triple
    point of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which is one of the secondary reference
    points of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS–90), using an adiabatic
    calorimeter with five capsule-type standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs).
    Impurity analyses showed that the purity of the CO<sub>2</sub> sample was 99.999 37%.
    A thermal treatment process before the realization of the triple point reduced
    the width of the melting curve of the triple point of CO<sub>2</sub> and increased
    the linearity of the melting curves with respect to the inverse of the melting
    fraction F. We determined the triple-point temperature of CO<sub>2</sub> at the
    liquidus point by extrapolating the six melting curves obtained after the thermal
    treatment process. The triple-point temperature of CO<sub>2</sub> measured in
    this work is 216.590 90 K \n \n 0.36 mK (k  =  1). This result indicates that
    the triple point of CO<sub>2</sub> can potentially be used as a fixed point based
    on the ITS–90 to replace the triple point of mercury.</p>"
