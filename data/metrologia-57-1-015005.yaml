    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A key requirement for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty in metrology is its transferability. This is particularly relevant for ensuring traceability through a chain of measurements. The GUM [JCGM 100] requires that ‘ <italic>it should be possible to use directly the uncertainty evaluated for one result as a component in evaluating the uncertainty of another measurement in which the first result is used</italic>’. The GUM implements the transfer of uncertainty by applying variance propagation to linear models or models that can be well approximated through a linearization. GUM-S1 [JCGM 101] has been released to broaden the scope of uncertainty evaluation to cover also non-linear models. We demonstrate in terms of examples that the GUM-S1 type A evaluation does not satisfy the requirement of transferability, i.e. re-using the probability distribution produced by GUM-S1 in a subsequent uncertainty exercise can lead to inadequate results for non-linear models. Furthermore, already for linear models the type A evaluation of GUM-S1 is shown to produce unsatisfactory solutions. These findings are discussed and the underlying reason is identified, namely that the use of non-informative priors as in GUM-S1 does not lead to results that can always be reliably transferred. We discuss possible alternatives and finally draw some conclusions.</p>
