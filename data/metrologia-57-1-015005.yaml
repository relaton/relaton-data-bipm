abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A key requirement for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty
    in metrology is its transferability. This is particularly relevant for ensuring
    traceability through a chain of measurements. The GUM [JCGM 100] requires that
    ‘ it should be possible to use directly the uncertainty evaluated for one result
    as a component in evaluating the uncertainty of another measurement in which the
    first result is used’. The GUM implements the transfer of uncertainty by applying
    variance propagation to linear models or models that can be well approximated
    through a linearization. GUM-S1 [JCGM 101] has been released to broaden the scope
    of uncertainty evaluation to cover also non-linear models. We demonstrate in terms
    of examples that the GUM-S1 type A evaluation does not satisfy the requirement
    of transferability, i.e. re-using the probability distribution produced by GUM-S1
    in a subsequent uncertainty exercise can lead to inadequate results for non-linear
    models. Furthermore, already for linear models the type A evaluation of GUM-S1
    is shown to produce unsatisfactory solutions. These findings are discussed and
    the underlying reason is identified, namely that the use of non-informative priors
    as in GUM-S1 does not lead to results that can always be reliably transferred.
    We discuss possible alternatives and finally draw some conclusions.</p>
