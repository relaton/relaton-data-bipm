abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper investigates the characteristics and the metrological
    limits of the calibration of spring type gravimeters by using a cylindrical test
    mass moved vertically around the gravimeter by a lifting device operated in the
    Mátyáshegy Observatory. The movement of the 3100 kg iron mass generates a sinusoid-like
    calibrating signal having a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1102 nm s<sup>−2</sup>.
    The careful determination of the geometrical and physical parameters of the test
    mass combined with the analytical modeling of its gravitational effect and the
    related uncertainties provides an accuracy of 3 nm s<sup>−2</sup> in absolute
    sense. The overall accuracy, however, is influenced by several other instrumental
    and environmental factors which are investigated in detail. The conclusions are
    based on more than 400 experiments with 5 LCR G instruments. As a unique case
    a Scintrex CG-5 instrument was also involved in the tests what is probably the
    very first moving mass calibration of this type of gravimeters.</p><p>Two processing
    methods, Max-Min and Full-Fit, based on L2 norm adjustment of the observations
    were developed and applied to obtain instrumental scale factor and other related
    parameters.</p><p>The results show that the observations corrected for the disturbing
    effects still contain a systematic constituent with amplitude of (10–20) nm s<sup>−2</sup>
    regardless which LCR instrument was calibrated. It resembles the second time derivative
    of the calibrating signal that may indicate the non-uniform elastic response of
    the spring sensors to the rate of gravity change. Due to the problems mentioned
    above the overall dispersion of the resultant random and non-random residuals
    of the calibration observations provided by Full-Fit method are typically 10 nm
    s<sup>−2</sup>. The a posteriori standard deviations of the individual scale factors
    provide, however, measurement accuracy of 2 nm s<sup>−2</sup>.</p>
