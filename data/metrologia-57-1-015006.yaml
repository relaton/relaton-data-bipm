    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper investigates the characteristics and the metrological limits of the calibration of spring type gravimeters by using a cylindrical test mass moved vertically around the gravimeter by a lifting device operated in the Mátyáshegy Observatory. The movement of the 3100 kg iron mass generates a sinusoid-like calibrating signal having a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1102 nm s<sup>−2</sup>. The careful determination of the geometrical and physical parameters of the test mass combined with the analytical modeling of its gravitational effect and the related uncertainties provides an accuracy of 3 nm s<sup>−2</sup> in absolute sense. The overall accuracy, however, is influenced by several other instrumental and environmental factors which are investigated in detail. The conclusions are based on more than 400 experiments with 5 LCR G instruments. As a unique case a Scintrex CG-5 instrument was also involved in the tests what is probably the very first moving mass calibration of this type of gravimeters.</p>
    <p>Two processing methods, <italic>Max-Min</italic> and <italic>Full-Fit</italic>, based on L2 norm adjustment of the observations were developed and applied to obtain instrumental scale factor and other related parameters.</p>
    <p>The results show that the observations corrected for the disturbing effects still contain a systematic constituent with amplitude of (10–20) nm s<sup>−2</sup> regardless which LCR instrument was calibrated. It resembles the second time derivative of the calibrating signal that may indicate the non-uniform elastic response of the spring sensors to the rate of gravity change. Due to the problems mentioned above the overall dispersion of the resultant random and non-random residuals of the calibration observations provided by <italic>Full-Fit</italic> method are typically 10 nm s<sup>−2</sup>. The <italic>a posteriori</italic> standard deviations of the individual scale factors provide, however, measurement accuracy of 2 nm s<sup>−2</sup>.</p>
