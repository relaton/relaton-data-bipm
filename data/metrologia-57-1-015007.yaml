    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The unique properties of the quantum Hall effect allow one to revisit traditional measurement circuits with a new flavour. In this paper we present the first realization of a quantum Hall Kelvin bridge for the calibration of standard resistors directly against the quantum Hall resistance. The bridge design is particularly simple and requires a minimal number of instruments. The implementation here proposed is based on the <italic>bridge-on-a-chip</italic>, an integrated circuit composed of three graphene quantum Hall elements and superconducting wiring. The accuracy achieved in the calibration of a 12 906 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab581eieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> standard resistor is of a few parts in 10<sup>8</sup>, at present mainly limited by the prototype device and the interferences in the current implementation, with the potential to achieve few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>, which is the level of the systematic uncertainty of the quantum Hall Kelvin bridge itself.</p>
