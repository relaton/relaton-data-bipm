abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the experimental results that when 100 seconds
    of vibration were recorded by the digital-output (DO) MEMS accelerometer with
    the 0.04% frequency-shifted sample clock, 23.8% of amplitude distortion with 71.2°
    of phase shift and 6.3% of amplitude distortion with 35.6° of phase shift were
    respectively observed in 10 Hz and 5 Hz of calibration frequencies. Theoretic
    models are also presented for the observed amplitude distortion and the phase
    shift caused by the frequency shift of the sample clock. Using the best-fitted
    frequency shift model by the least squares method, the vibration signals that
    were incorrectly sampled with the DO MEMS accelerometer were resampled at the
    corrected time slots and the corrected results showed the improvement of the measurement
    uncertainties in the amplitude and the phase of vibration within the 0.1% and
    0.1°, respectively.</p>
