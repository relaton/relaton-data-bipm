    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper presents the experimental results that when 100 seconds of vibration were recorded by the digital-output (DO) MEMS accelerometer with the 0.04% frequency-shifted sample clock, 23.8% of amplitude distortion with 71.2° of phase shift and 6.3% of amplitude distortion with 35.6° of phase shift were respectively observed in 10 Hz and 5 Hz of calibration frequencies. Theoretic models are also presented for the observed amplitude distortion and the phase shift caused by the frequency shift of the sample clock. Using the best-fitted frequency shift model by the least squares method, the vibration signals that were incorrectly sampled with the DO MEMS accelerometer were resampled at the corrected time slots and the corrected results showed the improvement of the measurement uncertainties in the amplitude and the phase of vibration within the 0.1% and 0.1°, respectively.</p>
