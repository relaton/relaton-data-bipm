abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The unique properties of the quantum Hall effect allow one to
    revisit traditional measurement circuits with a new flavour. In this paper we
    present the first realization of a quantum Hall Kelvin bridge for the calibration
    of standard resistors directly against the quantum Hall resistance. The bridge
    design is particularly simple and requires a minimal number of instruments. The
    implementation here proposed is based on the bridge-on-a-chip, an integrated circuit
    composed of three graphene quantum Hall elements and superconducting wiring. The
    accuracy achieved in the calibration of a 12â€‰906  standard resistor is of a few
    parts in 10<sup>8</sup>, at present mainly limited by the prototype device and
    the interferences in the current implementation, with the potential to achieve
    few parts in 10<sup>9</sup>, which is the level of the systematic uncertainty
    of the quantum Hall Kelvin bridge itself.</p>
