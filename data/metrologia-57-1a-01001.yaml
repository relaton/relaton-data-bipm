    <p></p><p>This comparison covers the measurement of calibration factors (CF) of power sensors and was carried out where SASO NMCC and TUBITAK UME participated, on the frame of GULFMET.</p><p>Calibration factors are used for characterization of RF power sensors. RF power sensors are used to measure RF power, and is an important mean to achieve traceability of RF power measurements. This bilateral comparison was performed by measuring a power sensor at frequencies of 10 MHz, 50 MHz, 1 GHz, 4 GHz, 8 GHz, 12 GHz, 15 GHz, and 18 GHz, at a power level of 0 dBm.</p><p>TÜBİTAK UME was acting as the pilot laboratory. The travelling standard was provided by SASO NMCC. TUBITAK UME was responsible for monitoring standard performance during the circulation and the evaluation and reporting of the comparison results.</p><p>The comparison was carried out in accordance with the CCEM Guidelines for Planning, Organizing, Conducting and Reporting Key, Supplementary and Pilot Comparisons.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
