    <p>This is a report of the results of an Interamerican Metrology System (SIM) comparison on high resistance values, performed to compare the measurement capabilities of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and (Instituto Costarrricense de Electricidad - Laboratorio Metrológico de Variables Eléctricas) ICE-LMVE and for establishing the degree of equivalence between those laboratories.</p>
    <p>During 2018, two resistance standards were used as traveling standards for measurements in those countries, with NIST-USA acting as the pilot laboratory. Results for four measurement points are presented as errors relative to a comparison reference value together with their uncertainty.</p>
