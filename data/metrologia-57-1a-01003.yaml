    <p></p><p>An intercomparison for standards of electrical energy has taken place within the framework of GULFMET. The intercomparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard'-UMTS (Ukraine), has involved three laboratories, including one who is a member of another regional metrological organization: EURAMET and COOMET. The results presented in this report appear to show that there are significant differences between some laboratories' representations of the watt-hour. However, the agreement demonstrated by the intercomparison provides confidence in maintaining traceability for active energy and reactive energy for 1.0, 0.5 Lag, 0.5 Lead power factors at frequencies of 50 Hz and 53 Hz.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
