    <p></p><p>The ongoing on-site comparison BIPM.EM-K12 is part of the BIPM programme implemented to verify the international coherence of the primary resistance standards. It allows National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) to validate their implementations of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) for dc resistance traceability by comparison to the reference maintained at the BIPM.</p><p>The realization of the ohm from the QHE-based standard of the NMIs at 100 Ω is compared with that realized by the BIPM from its own transportable quantum Hall resistance standard. This comparison is usually completed by scaling measurements from 100 Ω to 1 Ω and 10 kΩ through the measurement of the resistance ratios 100 Ω/1 Ω and 10 kΩ/100 Ω, respectively.</p><p>In November 2018, a new BIPM.EM-K12 on-site comparison was carried out at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ-AIST). It was the first time the NMIJ-AIST participated in this comparison programme.</p><p>In the present comparison, only the measurements of the 100 Ω based on the quantum Hall effect and of the 10 kΩ/100 Ω ratio were compared. The reason why the 100 Ω/1 Ω ratio was not measured is detailed in the report.</p><p>Measurements of the 100 Ω transfer standard in terms of the conventional value of the von Klitzing constant, R<sub>K-90</sub>, agreed to 1.8 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with a relative combined standard uncertainty u<sub>c</sub> = 8.7 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. Measurements of 10 kΩ/100 Ω ratio agreed to 6.8 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with u<sub>c</sub> = 8.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup>.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
