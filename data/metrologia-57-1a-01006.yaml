    <p></p><p>An international comparison of dc resistance at 10 MΩ and 1 GΩ was carried out under the framework of the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) of the Comité Consultatif d'Électricité et Magnétisme (CCEM). The comparison was piloted by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) with the participation of 12 National Metrology Institutes (NMIs). Two 10 MΩ resistors (Measurements International, model 9331) and two 1 GΩ resistors (Measurements International, model 9331S) were used as travelling standards. Although the uncertainty at 10 MΩ was limited by the stability of the travelling standards, the comparison achieved a reduction in the uncertainties of the degrees of equivalence relative to the 2002 CCEM-K2 comparison, especially at 1 GΩ where the improvement was quite significant.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
