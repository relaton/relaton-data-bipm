- content: |-
    <p></p><p>This report describes a bilateral comparison of resistance standards organised within the frame of the EU-Indonesia Trade Support Program II (TSP2) / AWP2-2-20-5 between LNE, France and KIM-LIPI, Indonesia. This bilateral comparison registered in the KCDB as EURAMET.EM-S40 was piloted by LNE. LNE participated in CCEM Key Comparison CCEM-K10 and CCEM-K2, thus providing the link between KIM-LIPI results and CCEM-K10 and CCEM-K2. This report includes the measurement results from the participants and information about their calibration methods for measurements of 1 mΩ, 100 Ω and 100 MΩ resistors.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
