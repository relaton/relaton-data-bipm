    <p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance between the NMC A*STAR (Singapore) and the BIPM carried out in 2018-2019. Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about two months, then for a period of about one month at the NMC A*STAR, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13b (for 10 kΩ).</p>
    <p>The results from the NMC A*STAR and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95% confidence, <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) of 0.064 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for 1 Ω and 0.036 × 10<sup>−6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p>
