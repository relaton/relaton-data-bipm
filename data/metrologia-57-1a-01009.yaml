    <p>The ongoing on-site comparison BIPM.EM-K12 is part of the BIPM programme implemented to verify the international coherence of the primary resistance standards. It allows National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) to validate their implementations of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) for dc resistance traceability by comparison to the reference maintained at the BIPM.</p>
    <p>The realization of the ohm from the QHE-based standard of the NMIs at 100 Ω is compared with that realized by the BIPM from its own transportable quantum Hall resistance standard. This comparison is usually completed by scaling measurements from 100 Ω to 1 Ω and 10 kΩ through the measurement of the resistance ratios 100 Ω/1 Ω and 10 kΩ/100 Ω, respectively.</p>
    <p>In September 2019, a new BIPM.EM-K12 on-site comparison was carried out at the National Institute of Metrology of China (NIM). It was the first time the NIM participated in this comparison programme.</p>
