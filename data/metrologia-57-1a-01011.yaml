    <p>This report describes a supplementary comparison on current ratio at power frequencies. The traveling standard was a high precision current transformer. Frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz were used with a current range between 5 A and 1000 A. Participants belong to SIM, except the national metrology institute of Germany, PTB, that belongs to EURAMET. The pilot institute was UTE, from Uruguay. The measurement results and uncertainties from all national metrology institutes, that have declared CMCs, were in agreement with them. The schedule had long delays due to customs procedures, but had no influence on the results due to the very high stability of the traveling transformer.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
