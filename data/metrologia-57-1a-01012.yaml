    <p>This report presents the GULFMET key comparison (GULFMET.EM.BIPM-K11) results of DC voltages at the 1.018 V and 10 V with two travelling electronic DC reference standards. This comparison was supported by the BIPM and GULFMET associate members, KRISS and SCL, which are from the APMP. The linking difference from the BIPM.EM-K11 KCRV was calculated. The agreement between participating laboratories is good, which could support GULFMET participating laboratories in submitting new calibration and measurement capability entries.</p>
