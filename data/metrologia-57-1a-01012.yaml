    <p></p><p>This report presents the GULFMET key comparison (GULFMET.EM.BIPM-K11) results of DC voltages at the 1.018 V and 10 V with two travelling electronic DC reference standards. This comparison was supported by the BIPM and GULFMET associate members, KRISS and SCL, which are from the APMP. The linking difference from the BIPM.EM-K11 KCRV was calculated. The agreement between participating laboratories is good, which could support GULFMET participating laboratories in submitting new calibration and measurement capability entries.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
