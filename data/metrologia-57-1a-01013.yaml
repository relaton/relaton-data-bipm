- content: |-
    <p>This report presents the results of a bilateral comparison between the SASO, Saudi Arabia, and the BIPM, which was carried out using two 10 pF and two 100 pF travelling standards belonging to the BIPM following an "A-B-A" pattern. The comparison at 10 pF forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.a and that at 100 pF of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b, where BIPM is the pilot laboratory for both comparisons.</p><p>The standards were measured during a total time of 21 weeks, from October 2019 to February 2020. The measurand of this comparison was the two terminal-pair capacitance of the travelling capacitors at a frequency of 1000 Hz, and a measuring rms voltage of 10 V.</p><p>The results from the SASO and the BIPM agree within a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty of the comparison, which is dominated by the contribution of the calibration of the SASO reference capacitors.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
