    <p>This report describes a bilateral comparison of DC voltage standards organised within the frame of the EU-Indonesia Trade Support Program II n° APE12-06b between LNE, France and KIMLIPI, Indonesia. This bilateral comparison registered in the KCDB as EURAMET.EM-S41 was piloted by LNE. LNE participated in EUROMET comparison N° 429, designated EUROMET.EM.BIPM-K11 thus providing the link between KIM-LIPI results and CCEM-K11. This report includes the measurement results from the participants and information about their calibration methods for measurements of 1,018 V and 10 V.</p>
