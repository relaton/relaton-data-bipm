abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A bilateral supplementary comparison for standards of electrical
    energy has taken place within the framework of GULFMET. The comparison, piloted
    by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard' - UMTS (Ukraine), has involved two laboratories
    (UMTS and QCC EMI, United Arab Emirates) from regional metrological organizations
    GULFMET and COOMET. The results presented in this report provides confidence in
    maintaining traceability for active energy and reactive energy for 1.0, 0.5 Lag,
    0.5 Lead power factors at frequencies of 50 Hz and 53 Hz.</p><p>To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
