    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A bilateral supplementary comparison for standards of electrical energy has taken place within the framework of GULFMET. The comparison, piloted by State Enterprise 'Ukrmetrteststandard' - UMTS (Ukraine), has involved two laboratories (UMTS and QCC EMI, United Arab Emirates) from regional metrological organizations GULFMET and COOMET. The results presented in this report provides confidence in maintaining traceability for active energy and reactive energy for 1.0, 0.5 Lag, 0.5 Lead power factors at frequencies of 50 Hz and 53 Hz.</p>
