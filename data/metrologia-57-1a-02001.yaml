    <p></p><p>Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), National Institute of Metrology (NIM), and All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI)</p><p>started an international comparison on the spectral radiance over the spectral region from 250</p><p>nm to 2500 nm in 2012 and completed all measurements in 2016. The aim of this comparison was to assess the equivalence of the spectral radiance scales between the three laboratories.</p><p>This comparison was carried out according to the technical protocol listed in the KCDB under</p><p>the identifier APMP.PR-S6. The difference from the reference value (RV) and its uncertainty of each participant of this comparison were calculated by using the relative difference model recommended by the Guidelines for CCPR Comparison Report Preparation. A method (ratio method) to calculate the difference from the RV and its uncertainty was proposed to eliminate the pilot effects involved in the relative difference model. In the ratio method, spectral radiance ratios to the pilot and geometric means were used to calculate the difference from the RV and its uncertainty of each participant. Results of this comparison analyzed using the ratio method showed that differences from the RV of all participants were within their uncertainties (k = 2) except a few wavelengths for each participant.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
