    <p>This report gives the results of the COOMET.PR-K3 comparison of luminous intensity. Five laboratories took part in the comparison. COOMET.PR-K3 was piloted by Belarusian State Institute of Metrology (BelGIM). The linkage to KCRV was provided through the participation of the All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical measurement (VNIIOFI) and Slovak Institute of Metrology (SMU). Other participants were National Scientific Center "Institute of Metrology" (NSC IM), Ukraine and Kazakhstan Institute of Metrology (KazInMetr).</p>
    <p>BelGIM, NSC IM and KazInMetr were non-linked laboratories. A set of three incandescent lamps was used as traveling comparison artefact. Degrees of equivalence of all three non-linked laboratories were within their expanded uncertainties.</p>
