    <p>Justervesenet (JV, Norway) and Metrosert (Estonia) agreed in 2016 to conduct a bilateral comparison of SPRT calibrations for the fixed points from the triple point of Hg to the freezing point of Zn, with the exception of the freezing point of In which Metrosert could not realise. The aim of the comparison was to link Metrosert to the CCT-K9 via the EURAMET-T.K9. JV was the linking laboratory to the EURAMET-T.K9 and the pilot. An SPRT was first calibrated at Metrosert, shipped to JV and calibrated there, and finally returned to Metrosert for a second calibration. The measurements were carried out and completed in 2017.</p>
    <p>The results show that the laboratories involved are in agreement. At the triple point of Hg and the melting point of Ga the results are consistent and agree at all three reported measurements. At the freezing points of Sn and Zn Metrosert observes some change in W-values, although the difference is smaller than the reported uncertainty. The difference may suggest some drift either in the circulating probe or in the reference equipment at Metrosert, and this discrepancy increased the uncertainty in the degree of equivalence somewhat.</p>
    <p>The resistance of the probe was measured at the triple point of water after every fixed point, and prior to and after annealing upon reception at the laboratories. In general the resistance values are stable, but may suggest some drift between the first measurements at Metrosert and the measurements at JV.</p>
