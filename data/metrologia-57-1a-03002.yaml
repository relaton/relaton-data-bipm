- content: |-
    <p>The aim of this paper is to describe a bilateral comparison carried out by the hygrometry laboratories of the National Metrological Institutes of Brazil and Argentina, INMETRO and INTI, respectively. The comparison, registered as a bilateral key comparison of the Inter American Metrology System (SIM) as SIM.T-K6.7 - INMETRO/INTI, was performed in the range from -30 °C to 60 °C of dew/frost-point temperatures. This paper presents the facilities of the laboratories, the measurement procedures, the uncertainty analysis, the compatibility of the measurement results (by means of the normalised error and by the degree of equivalence) and the degree of equivalence for the dew-point temperatures 1 °C and 20 °C between INTI and the CCT-K6 key comparison reference value by means of a previous comparison between INMETRO and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p><p>Main text</p><p>
