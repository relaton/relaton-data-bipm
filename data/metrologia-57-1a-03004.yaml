    <p></p><p>This report describes the results of supplementary comparison COOMET.T-S3 (also known as supplementary comparison COOMET 768/GE/18) on relative humidity (RH) from 30 % rh to 90 % rh at 23 째C. The comparison was organised between the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) United Kingdom (Laboratory-coordinator) and Georgian National Agency for Standards and Metrology (GEOSTM), Georgia. The comparison started in July 2018 and finished in September 2019</p><p>The majority of the bilateral degree of equivalence values, D<sub>GEOSTM/NPL</sub>, for the two participants are low compared to the uncertainty in the DoE, U<sub>GEOSTM/NPL</sub>. With this comparison, the participant GEOSTM has demonstrated their technical competence for realization of relative humidity in the range 30 %rh to 90 %rh at 23 째C</p><p>Main text</p><p>
