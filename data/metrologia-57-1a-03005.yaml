    <p></p><p>The bilateral comparison of the ITS-90 realizations at the National Metrological Institutes of Germany (PTB) and the Russian Federation (VNIIM) in the temperature range from 273,16 K to 692,677 K was initiated by the Technical Committee on "Thermometry and thermal physics" TC1.10 of COOMET.</p><p>The purpose of the comparison was to evaluate the differences between the realizations of the national standards in the most essential temperature range with the highest requirements to the measurement uncertainty. This temperature range includes five ITS-90 fixed points: the triple point of water, the melting point of gallium, the freezing points of indium, tin and zinc.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
