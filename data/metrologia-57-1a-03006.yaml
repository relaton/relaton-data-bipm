    <p>This report present the results of the EURAMET inter-comparison carried out to compare the calibration of thermocouples from 419,527 °C (freezing point of Zn) up to 1492 °C (melting point of the Pd-C eutectic). This inter-comparison is intended to be used to support the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) of the participants in the calibration of thermocouples.</p>
    <p>The comparison was organized in three loops with nineteen participating laboratories and it allowed the performance of the measurement either in fixed points and/or by comparison. The method used to analyse the results of the comparison was the generalized weighted mean that takes into account the full covariance matrix that includes correlations between the participants which have similar traceability sources and between measurements performed by the same laboratory (i.e. the pilots that performed measurements at the beginning and at the end of each loop and the measurements performed by the same laboratory in fixed points and by comparison at the same calibration point).</p>
