    <p>A Consultative Committee on Thermometry (CCT) Key Comparison of frost point temperatures was carried out by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, USA) and the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ, Japan) between December 2015 and November, 2016. The results of this comparison are reported here, along with descriptions of the humidity laboratory standards for NIST and NMIJ/AIST and the uncertainty budget for these standards. This report also describes the protocol for the comparison and presents the data acquired. The results are analyzed, determining degree of equivalence between the frost-point standards of NIST and NMIJ.</p>
