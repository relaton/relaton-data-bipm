- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to water standards of the KRISS, Korea and the BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the comparison of 12 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
