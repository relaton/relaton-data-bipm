    <p></p><p>A comparison of the activity concentration measurement of a<sup>3</sup>H<sub>2</sub>O solution was organized by the LNE-LNHB under the auspices of the CCRI(II). The solution was sent to thirteen laboratories and eleven measurement reports were received. The results, as well as relevant information on the measurement techniques, are presented and analysed in this paper. All results are consistent within uncertainties. As the solution was traceable to the solution used in the CCRI(II)-K2.H-3 comparison in 2009, the results of both comparisons are also presented.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
