    <p>The air kerma calibration coefficients of a set of four transfer ionization chambers and the air kerma-length product calibration coefficients for a set of two transfer pencil-type ionization chambers were compared at the PTB, Germany, and the CPHR, Cuba, for 15 selected radiation qualities as used in mammography, general diagnostic radiology, computed tomography, radiation therapy and radiation protection. The CPHR performed its measurements in the period January to September 2017 and the PTB before (November 2016) and after (December 2017) that period. The comparison results for the selected beam qualities expressed as the ratio of calibration coefficients were in the range (0.98-1.01) and mostly (12 out of 18) consistent within the relative standard uncertainty of the comparison which ranged between 0.6 % and 1 %. Five results were within the extended (k=2) standard uncertainty. One result deviated relatively by 1.9%. A possible reason for the larger deviation is discussed. The results are published in the Key Comparison Data Base (KCDB) of the BIPM as supplementary comparison COOMET.RI(I)-S4.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
