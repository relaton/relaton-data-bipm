    <p>This report concerns an updated submission of a <sup>54</sup>Mn standard by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) to the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Mn-54 comparison. The result has been added to the previous results and this has produced a revised value for the key comparison reference value (KCRV), calculated using the power-moderated weighted mean. A link has been made to the CCRI(II)-K2.Mn-54 comparison held in 2003 by measurement of the K2 <sup>54</sup>Mn solution in the International Reference System (SIR). The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the KCRV have been calculated for the remaining six NMIs in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Mn-54 comparison and the fourteen other participants in the CCRI(II)-K2.Mn-54 comparison. A graphical presentation is included.</p>
