- content: |-
    <p></p><p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to water standards of the LNE-LNHB, France, and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in general agreement at the level of the expanded (k = 2) uncertainty of the comparison of 2 parts in 10<sup>2</sup>. The results are presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
