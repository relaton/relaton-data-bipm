    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NRC and the BIPM in mammography x ray beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the combined standard uncertainty of 3.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
