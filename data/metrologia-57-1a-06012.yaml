    <p>The results of a regional supplementary comparison of air kerma standards from eight standards laboratories are presented. The three transfer ionisation chambers (two model Exradin A4 chambers and one Exradin A5 chamber manufactured by Standard Imaging, Inc, Middleton, MI, USA) were measured at each laboratory over the period 2013 to 2016. Air kerma calibration coefficients for the transfer instruments were compared for the ISO 4037 narrow- and wide-spectrum series of x-ray beams, in the range from 30 kV to 300 kV. Results from the five primary standard and three secondary standard laboratories were obtained. For each radiation quality, the results were expressed as the ratio of the laboratory to the comparison reference value, which was the average of three laboratories selected for this purpose before the comparison began. The A5 transfer standard was also compared for air kerma at protection-level <sup>137</sup>Cs gamma rays. Laboratories reported their conversion coefficients for ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), and so the comparison also served as an indirect test of this quantity. Overall, the laboratories were in general agreement within the expanded uncertainties claimed by the laboratories. The comparison is designated APMP.RI(I)-S3 under the international arrangements for comparisons conducted to support the CIPM MRA.</p>
