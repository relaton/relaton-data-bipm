    <p></p><p>This force comparison was performed between IDIC (Chile), INTI (Argentina) and INM (Colombia), members of the SIM region. Each laboratory used its national standard for the established measuring range. The comparison started in August 2013 and finished in December 2013. This comparison has an overlap with the force steps used in the CIPM Key Comparison CCM.F-K2.a.1, at force points 50 kN and 100 kN.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
