    <p>The CCM.G-K2.2017 comparison was organised for the purpose of determination of the degree of equivalence of the national standards for free-fall acceleration measurement. The comparison was held in the Changping Campus of National Institute of Metrology China (NIM), from October to November in 2017. This is the first time that such a comparison is organized outside of the Europe continent and establishes a new global comparison sites in China. This comparison is also the largest ever organized with the participation of 13 instruments.</p><p>We give the list of the participants who actually performed measurements during the comparison, the data (raw absolute gravity measurements and their uncertainties) submitted by the participants as well as the results of the vertical gravity gradient at the comparison sites. The measurement strategy is briefly discussed and the data elaboration is presented. Finally, the results of the data adjustment are presented including the degrees of equivalence (DoE) of the absolute gravimeters and the key comparison reference values (KCRVs). Overall, the measurements of KC instruments are all consistent given the declared uncertainties.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
