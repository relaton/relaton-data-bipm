    <p>In order to evaluate the stated uncertainty and degrees of equivalence between CENAM-Mexico, BSJ-Jamaica, TTBS-Trinidad and Tobago and INDOCAL-Dominican Republic on mass calibration, an inter-comparison was agreed between all participating laboratories, in the range of 200 mg to 2 kg.</p><p>Results of this comparison were linked to the reference values of the key comparisons CCM.M-K4 and CCM.M-K5 trough CENAM results.</p><p></p><p>Main text</p><p>
