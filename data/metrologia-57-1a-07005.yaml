    <p></p><p>This report summarizes the results of the key comparison (KC) carried out among seven National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) five of which are member countries of Gulf Association for Metrology (GULFMET). The KC of 5 kg, 100 g, 10 g, 5 g stainless steel knob weights and 500 mg nickel silver flat pentagonal shaped weight was decided during the 11th meeting of GULFMET TC Mass held in Abu Dhabi, 2017. TÜBİTAK UME (Turkey) acted as pilot laboratory. The comparison was linked to CCM.M-K7 via INRIM (Italy) and METAS (Switzerland). The results were evaluated by the generalized least square (GLS) estimation. Majority of results were consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value of CCM.M-K7 within their expanded uncertainties with the coverage factor of k = 2.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
