    <p></p><p>This report presents the results of a supplementary comparison of force standard machines organized by GULFMET and piloted by TÜBİTAK UME. This is the first such comparison organized in the Gulf region and was carried out in accordance with the procedures detailed in CIPM MRA-D-05 with the purpose of providing evidence for the metrological equivalence of participants in force realization in the ranges of 100 kN and 1000 kN. It can be surmised from the result evaluation that the participants' performance is satisfactory and the uncertainty values claimed by them have been validated.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
