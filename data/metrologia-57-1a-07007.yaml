    <p></p><p>This report presents the results of a bilateral supplementary comparison of force standard machines between SASO-NMCC and TÜBİTAK-UME which was the pilot laboratory. The purpose of the comparison was the demonstration of metrological equivalence in force realization in the ranges of 1 kN, 10 kN and 100 kN. The result evaluation shows that the participant's performance is satisfactory and the uncertainty values claimed by it have been validated.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
