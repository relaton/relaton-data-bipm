- content: |-
    <p></p><p>This report describes the results of a successful two-phase interlaboratory comparison between Georgian National Agency for Standards and Metrology (GeoSTM), Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) and Slovak Metrology Institute (SMU) denoted as COOMET.M.P-S4. The ranges of the absolute pressure from 0 MPa to 7 MPa and gauge pressure from 0 MPa to 2 MPa were chosen as the most suitable for a mutual comparison. A digital pressure gauge, DHI RPM4 served as a transfer standard in both phases. Firstly, bilateral interlaboratory comparison (BILC) between two participants, CMI (pilot and reference laboratory) and GeoSTM, started in March 2017 and finished in April 2017. Secondly, interlaboratory comparison (ILC) between three participants, CMI (pilot and reference laboratory), SMU (co-reference laboratory) and GeoSTM, started in October 2018 and finished in February 2019. SMU took part only in the absolute pressure comparison.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
