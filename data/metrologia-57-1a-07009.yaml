    <p>The bilateral key comparison between PTB and VNIIM (CCM.FF-K3.2011.1) was performed as direct follow-up of the CIPM air speed key comparison (CCM.FF-K3.2011) which was organized to determine the degree of equivalence of the national standards for air speed covering the range 0.5 m/s to 40 m/s under ambient conditions. An ultrasonic anemometer and a laser Doppler anemometer were used as transfer standards. The measurement procedures in the technical protocol as well as the transfer standards for the bilateral key comparison (CCM.FF-K3.2011.1) were identical to the CIPM Key Comparison (CCM.FF-K3.2011) with nine participants from three RMOs. Thus, the measurement results were directly linked to the key comparison reference values published in the final report of the (CCM.FF-K3.2011) for each standard and each air speed separately. The degree of equivalence of each result with the key comparison reference value (KCRV) was calculated. All reported results of the bilateral key comparison were consistent with the KCRV results of the (CCM.FF-K3.2011).</p>
