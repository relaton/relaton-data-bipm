    <p></p><p>This report describes the results of first APMP key comparison on Vickers hardness, APMP.M.H-K1b and APMP.M.H-K1c involving Seven member institutes, CMS/ITRI (Chinese Taipei), KRISS (Korea, Republic of), NIM (China), NMIJ/AIST (Japan), NIMT (Thailand), SCL (Hong Kong, China) and VMI (Vietnam). The pilot laboratory was NMIJ/AIST. Three institute, KRISS, NIM and NMIJ/AIST, act as linking institutes to the key comparisons CCM.H-K1b and CCM.H-K1c conducted for the Vickers hardness scales HV1 and HV30, respectively.</p><p>The comparison was also conducted for HV 10 Vickers hardness scales and it was conducted as the supplemental comparison item.</p><p>The comparison item is Vickers hardness for 200 HV 1, 200 HV 10, 200 HV 30, 600 HV 1, 600 HV 10, 600 HV 30, 900 HV 1, 900 HV 10, and 900 HV 30. Through this comparison, the results for 200 HV 1, 600 HV 1 and 900 HV 1 scales are linked to CCM.H-K1b, and the results for 200 HV 30, 600 HV 30 and 900 HV 30 scales are linked to CCM.H-K1c. The reference values were calculated by using weighted mean from the results of the institutes. The Degree of Equivalence (DoE) was indicated by the relative deviation from the reference values. All institute results showed in good agreement to the key comparison reference values of CCM.H-K1b and CCM.H-K1c.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
