    <p>This report gives the results of a comparison of pressure standards of three National Metrology institutes in the range of 0.7 MPa to 7 MPa. This comparison was piloted by UME and was carried out from February 2017 to March 2019. This work is a part of the GULFMET project and is registered as a supplementary comparison GULFMET.M.P-S1. The transfer standard used was a digital pressure gauge, model 745-1K, serial number 114944, manufactured by Paroscientific Inc, with a resolution of 1 hPa. The reference values have been determined from the weighted mean of the deviations which is a measurement error of the test instrument reported by the participants for each specified pressure.</p>
