    <p></p><p>A Regional Metrology Organization (RMO) key comparison on the calibration of a reference torque wrench was carried out between the Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM, Mexico) and the Instituto Nacional de Metrologia (INM, Colombia), between September 2017 and October 2017. The results of this comparison are reported here, along with descriptions of torque standards used by CENAM and INM, and the uncertainty budget for these standards. This report also describes the protocol for the comparison and presents the data acquired. The results are analyse, determining the degree of equivalence between the torque measurements from CENAM and INM.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
