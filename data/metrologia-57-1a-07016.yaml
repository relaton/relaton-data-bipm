    <p>An inter-comparison in the calibration of micropipette was conducted among 12 different National Metrology Institutes between 2014 and 2016. Three 100 μL micropipettes were supplied as transfer artifacts. However, one of the three micropipettes did not fulfil the stability assessment criterion and therefore it was excluded from the inter-comparison. The other two micro pipettes were transferred among the participants. The results reported by the participants were corrected to the standard atmospheric pressure to ensure that the comparison is conducted under approximately the same conditions. The key comparison reference value and its standard uncertainty were calculated as a weighted mean from the results reported by the participants. The outlier values were handled throughout the iterative chi-square consistency check method where only one result was excluded from the calculation of the reference value. Except only one participant's results, the results reported by the other participants were in consistent with the key comparison reference value.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
