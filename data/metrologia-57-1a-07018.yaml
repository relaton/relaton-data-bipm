    <p>This report describes a bilateral EURAMET supplementary comparison on Rockwell hardness scales of two national metrology institutes of Italy and Turkey, INRiM and UME, respectively. The pilot laboratory is INRiM in the comparison where three sets of hardness reference blocks for the Rockwell hardness scales of HRA, HRBW and HRC were used. Each set of blocks consists of four hardness reference blocks for HRA and HRBW and five blocks for HRC hardness scales. The comparison was realized as planned in the Technical Protocol with some delay. The measurement results and uncertainty assessments declared by INRiM and UME are in consistency with each other.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
