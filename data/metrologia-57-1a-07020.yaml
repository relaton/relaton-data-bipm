    <p>The regional supplementary comparison EURAMET.M.P-S13 for pressure measurements in liquid media from 10 MPa to 100 MPa was piloted by the TÜBİTAK UME Pressure Laboratory, Turkey. The transfer standard was a digital pressure gauge, serial number 116321, manufactured by Paroscientific Inc. Eighteen laboratories participated in this comparison. Fourteen laboratories are from EURAMET region; namely UME, MKEH, BoM, DPM, DMDM, MBM, GUM, IMT, HMI/FSB-LPM, VSL, VTT MIKES, FORCE Technology, IMBIH, NSAI NML. VMC is from COOMET and QAF, EMI, SASO NMCC are from GULFMET region.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
