    <p>During the EURAMET TC-F annual meeting, held in Boras in 2015, it was agreed to perform the follow up of the CCM.FF-K4.1.2011 organized for the EURAMET NMIs for volume of liquids at 20 L. The transfer standard was a 20 L pipette supplied by CENAM. The participants of this comparison also involved in the comparison CCM.FF-K4.1.2011 were: CENAM, INRIM, IPQ, RISE and VSL, in total there were twenty-one participants. The comparison was organized in two petals, INIRM perform three measurements, at the beginning, after the first petal and at the end of the circulation. The comparison measurements started in April 2016 and ended in October 2017. It should be noted that most of the participants (thirteen) declared an expanded uncertainty less than 0,005 %.</p>
