    <p>A EURAMET key comparison of the national pressure standards in the range 0.7 MPa to 7.0 MPa of gas gauge pressure was carried out. The circulation of the transfer standard began in November 2011 and lasted until November 2016.</p>
    <p>The measurand of the comparison was the effective area of the piston-cylinder assembly determined by gauge pressure measurements in the range from 0.7 MPa to 7.0 MPa.</p>
    <p>As the comparison reference value, the weighted mean of the results of the laboratories with primary pressure standards was used.</p>
    <p>With this reference value, all the participants who delivered the results demonstrated equivalence respective to the reference value within expanded uncertainties (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) on all the range.</p>
    <p>The results of this comparison were linked to CCM key comparison CCM.P-K1.c. Also in relation to the reference values of CCM.P-K1.c, all participants demonstrated agreement within expanded uncertainties (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) at all pressure points.</p>
