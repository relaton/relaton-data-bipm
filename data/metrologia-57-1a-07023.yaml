    <p>A supplementary comparison, COOMET.M.FF-S2, in the field of water flow was organized by the COOMET Technical Committee (TC) 1.4 Flow Measurement. The goal of the comparison was to confirm the calibration and measurement capabilities (CMC) of the participating national metrology institutes (NMIs) in the flow ranges between 0.5 m<sup>3</sup>/h and 5.0 m<sup>3</sup>/h, and, respectively, between 20.0 m<sup>3</sup>/h and 100.0 m<sup>3</sup>/h. This is the first comparison in the field of fluid flow which has been done by the COOMET TC Flow Measurement.</p><p>This report describes the comparison results of the following water flow facilities (NMIs): PTB (Braunschweig, Germany), National standards Centre of the Republic of Uzbekistan (Tashkent, Republic of Uzbekistan), LEI (Kaunas, Lithuania), SMU (Bratislava, Slovakia), BelGIM (Minsk, Belarus), VNIIR (Kazan, Russia).</p><p>The PTB was designated as the pilot lab of this comparison, due to the low measurement uncertainty of its water flow primary standard, in comparison to all participants, and because of its experience in leading and participating in previous international flow comparisons.</p><p>In order to cover a large flowrate range, two transfer standard packages were delivered to all involved NMIs of the inter-laboratory comparison. For low flowrate range and nominal diameter of 25 mm a turbine meter and an electromagnetic flowmeter were used as transfer standards. For upper flow rates two turbine meters with a nominal diameter of 80 mm were used. All calibrations were made during March 2009 until May 2012.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
