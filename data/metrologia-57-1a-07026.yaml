    <p>The supplementary international comparison of national gas flow standards COOMET.M.FF-S9 was carried out from May 2019 to January 2020. The comparison were made in the range of gas flow from 20 to 6500 m<sup>3</sup>/h. Six European National Metrological Institutes (VNIIM-VNIIR, PTB, IFSM, BelGIM, LEI and LABSAGAS) took part in the comparison. The VNIIM-VNIIR acted as a pilot laboratory. The participants used for comparison the reference test rigs, implemented mainly on the basis of reference critical nozzles or reference flow meters. The transportable comparison standards (rotary and turbine flow meters) were used for the comparison procedure and in sequence were sent to the participants for testing. According to the results of the comparison, all participants confirmed their calibration and measuring capabilities in the declared flow ranges.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
