    <p></p><p>This report summarizes the results of the key comparison (KC) carried out among eight National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and an Accredited Calibration Laboratory, six of which are member countries of Gulf Association for Metrology (GULFMET). The KC of two 1 kg stainless steel knob weights was decided during the 11th meeting of GULFMET TC Mass held in Abu Dhabi, 2017. TÜBİTAK UME (Turkey) acted as pilot laboratory. The comparison was linked to CCM.M-K4 via INRIM (Italy), METAS (Switzerland), KRISS (Republic of Korea). The results were evaluated by the generalized least square (GLS) estimation. Majority of results were consistent with each other and with the key comparison reference value of CCM.M-K4 within their expanded uncertainties with the coverage factor of k = 2.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
