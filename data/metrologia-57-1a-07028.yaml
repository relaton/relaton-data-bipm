    <p>The results are presented of the key comparison EURAMET 1031 (EURAMET.M.D-K1.1) that covered the measurements of density and volume of silicon spheres of three different masses at 20 °C and 101325 Pa. The volume and density determinations of 15 national metrology institutes (NMIs) were checked and linked to the CCM.D-K1 key comparison. The measurements were carried out near 20 °C and at atmospheric pressure by the hydrostatic method in the time interval from 16 May 2008 to 18 Jan 2011.</p>
    <p>The comparison was performed in two petals with three spheres in each petal. The travelling standards of petal 1 have a mass of 1001 g, 200 g and 35 g (Petal 2: 984 g, 239 g, 35 g). Whereas the reference values of the 1 kg travelling standards could be determined by the link to the CCM.D-K1 comparison, the density reference values for the smaller spheres were determined by density comparison to the 1 kg spheres using the pressure-of-flotation method.</p>
    <p>One result was wrong due to a mistake in the mass determination. Additionally, four of the 57 volume (or density) values were discrepant with En values larger than 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.6.</p>
    <p>Five NMIs achieved density uncertainties of about 1 ppm (1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> in relative terms) or less for the 1 kg spheres. This satisfies the needs of all customers who wish to calibrate solid density standards for other laboratories.</p>
    <p>Volume determinations of mass standards, air density artefacts or sorption artefacts should reach an uncertainty of about 1 mm<sup>3</sup> in order to reduce the effect on the mass uncertainty to about 1 μg. At least for silicon spheres this is reached by eight NMIs. Due to the higher density of stainless steel this may be different for weights and will be checked within the CCM.D-K3 comparison.</p>
    <p>The results of the comparison can be used to submit new or improved entries in the calibration measurement capabilities table in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
