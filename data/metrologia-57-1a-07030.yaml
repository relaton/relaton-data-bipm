    <p>This report describes the first CCM key comparison of realizations of the kilogram definition based on the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant, which came into force on 20 May 2019. The objectives were to determine the level of agreement between realizations of the kilogram using Kibble and joule balances and the X-ray crystal density (XRCD) method and to provide input for the calculation of the first "consensus value" of the kilogram. The consensus value will serve as the basis for an internationally coordinated dissemination of the kilogram which will continue until sufficient agreement between realization experiments has been achieved.</p>
    <p>The comparison was organized by the BIPM and had seven participants. The BIPM, KRISS, NIST and NRC operated Kibble balances, the NIM used a joule balance and the NMIJ and the PTB participated using <sup>28</sup>Si spheres, the masses of which were determined with the XRCD method. These realization methods were used to calibrate 1 kg mass standards under vacuum. The standards were sent (in air) to the BIPM where they were compared under vacuum with each other and with BIPM Pt-Ir working standards. The latter were calibrated (in air) traceable to the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), the mass of which served as the definition of the kilogram until 20 May 2019.</p>
    <p>The results of the weighings at the BIPM together with the measurement results communicated by the participants allowed comparison of the values attributed to mass standards of 1 kg using the participating realization experiments. The level of agreement between mass determinations with the realization experiments and the BIPM as-maintained mass unit, traceable to the Planck constant through the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram can also be deduced.</p>
