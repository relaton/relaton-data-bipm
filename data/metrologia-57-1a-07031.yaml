    <p>In the present comparison, the degrees of equivalence of the measurement standards for vacuum pressures from 3E-4 Pa up to 1 Pa of three NMIs were evaluated by comparison with the measurement standards PTB serving as linking laboratory to the two key comparisons CCM.P-K15 and CCM.P-K4. The three NMIs were IMT, Slovenia, NIMT, Thailand and TUBITAK-UME, Turkey. Two spinning rotor gauges served as transfer standards and showed a very good stability. All NMIs and at all pressures showed equivalence with the key comparison reference values of CCM.P-K15 and CCM.P-K4. Another NMI, CEM, Spain, took part in the comparison, but did not deliver any data.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
