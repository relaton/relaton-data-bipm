    <p>Key comparison CCQM-K86.c was performed to demonstrate the capacity of National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) in the determination of the relative quantity of two specific genomic DNA fragments present in a canola powder. The study provides direct support for the following measurement claim: "Quantification of the ratio of the number of copies of specified intact sequence fragments of a length up to 150 nucleotides following extraction from an unprocessed, high fat/oil ground seed matrix, with a copy number ratio from 0.001 to 1".</p>
    <p>The study was carried out under the auspices of the Nucleic Acids Working Group (NAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM) and was jointly coordinated by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the EU Joint Research Centre, Geel (JRC). The following laboratories (in alphabetical order) submitted measurement results in this key comparison study: Centro Nacional de Metrología, Mexico ("CENAM"); D.I. Mendeleyev Institute of Metrology, Russia ("VNIIM"); EU Joint Research Centre, Geel (JRC); Hong Kong Government Laboratory ("GLHK"); Instituto Nacional de Metrología de Colombia ("INM"); LGC (United Kingdom); National Institute of Biology, Slovenia ("NIB"); National Institute of Metrology, P.R. of China ("NIM China"/"NIMC" [figures]); National Institute of Metrology, Thailand (NIMT); National Measurement Institute, Australia ("NMIA"); National Metrology Institute of Japan, AIST, Japan ("NMIJ"); National Metrology Institute of Turkey ("TÜBITAK").</p>
