- content: |-
    <p>At the highest metrological level, biogas standards are commonly prepared gravimetrically as PSMs (primary standard mixtures). This international key comparison addresses the composition of biogas, to support calibration and measurement services for this renewable energy gas. The mixtures contain nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ethane, propane, hydrogen and oxygen and represent the composition of biogas from landfills. The results in this Track C key comparison on the composition of biogas are generally good. Some of the datasets, especially that of oxygen, showed substantial extra dispersion, that could not be explained by the stated uncertainties.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
