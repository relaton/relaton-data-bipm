    <p>The demonstration of competency and equivalence for the assessment of levels of contaminants and nutrients in primary foodstuffs is a priority within the 10-year strategy for the CCQM Organic Analysis WG series of Track A core comparisons. The area of low polarity analytes in high fat foods had not been covered by the OAWG for many years since the key comparison CCQM-K21 p,p'-DDT in fish oil occurring in 2000.</p><p>Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the markers for the occurrence of PAHs in foods, for which maximum residue limits are enforced in many countries. Edible oil and fats are the main source of human PAH intake. BaP may form in edible oils by pyrolytic processes, such as incomplete combustion of organic substances. Worldwide regulatory limits of BaP in edible fats and oils are from 2.0 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg. Comparable and traceable measurement results for BaP in oil are important worldwide. Thus BaP in edible oil was the model system selected to align within the OAWG strategy.</p><p>16 NMIs and DIs participated in CCQM-K146. Different methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, GPC and SPE were applied in the sample pre-treatment and HPLC-FLD, HPLC-MS/MS, and GC-MS or GC-MS/MS were applied for detection by the participants. Most participants either used their own CRMs, other NMI's CRMs or pure materials assessed in house to guarantee traceability to SI for the calibrants. One lab was excluded from the KCRV evaluation, as they did not meet the CIPM metrological traceability requirements for their calibrant. Regarding the data evaluation, five labs withdrew their results from the statistical evaluation of the KCRV for technical reasons. In line with the OAWG guidance document for KCRV estimator selection, the Hierarchical Bayes option was selected for the KCRV value, which was determined as 2.74 μg/kg with a standard uncertainty of 0.03 μg/kg. The remaining ten institutes that were included in the calculation of the consensus KCRV all agreed within their standard uncertainties.</p><p>In general, the majority of CCQM-K146 participants performed very well. Therefore, this Track A Key Comparison directly illustrates the capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with molecular mass of 100 g/mol to 500 g/mol, having low polarity pKow &lt; -2, in mass fraction range from 0.1 μg/kg to 1000 μg/kg in a high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate food matrix.</p><p>Main text</p><p>

Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
