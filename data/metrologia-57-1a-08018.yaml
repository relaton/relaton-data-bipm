    <p>Growing awareness of the impact of monoterpenes on climate, atmospheric chemistry, and indoor air quality has necessitated the development of measurement standards to globally monitor and control their emissions. For National Metrology Institutes to develop such standards, it is essential that they demonstrate measurement equivalence for assigned values at the highest levels of accuracy. This report describes the results of a pilot comparison for 4 key monoterpene species: α-pinene, 3-carene, R-limonene and 1,8-cineole, at a nominal amount-of-substance fraction of 2.5 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. The objective of this comparison is to evaluate participant capabilities to measure trace-level monoterpenes using their own calibration techniques.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
