    <p>The CCQM-K154.a and subsequent CCQM-K154.a.1 comparisons were coordinated by the the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the Chinese National Institute of Metrology (NIM) on behalf of the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) for National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) which provide measurement services in organic analysis under the 'Comité International des Poids et Mesures' Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA) and/or have participated in the BIPM's Mycotoxin Metrology Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer (MMCBKT) project as part of its "Metrology for Safe Food and Feed in Developing Economies" Capacity Building Programme.</p><p>Gravimetrically-prepared solutions having an assigned mass fraction of specified organic analytes are routinely used to calibrate measurement processes for the quantification of the same analytes in matrix samples. Appropriate assignments of the property value and associated uncertainty of calibration solutions thus underpin the traceability of routine analysis and are critical for accurate measurements. Evidence of successful participation in relevant international comparisons is needed to document calibration and measurement capability claims (CMCs) made by national metrology institutes and designated institutes. In total, eleven NMIs/DIs participated in the Track C, Model II, Key Comparison CCQM-K154.a and the Subsequent Comparison CCQM-K154.a.1 [Gravimetric preparation and value assignment of trans-zearalenone (trans-ZEN) in acetonitrile (ACN)] for emerging areas of global interest and innovation. Participants were requested to gravimetrically prepare calibration solutions and value assign the mass fractions, expressed in mg/kg, of trans-zearalenone (trans-ZEN) in the acetonitrile (ACN) solution. Study samples, with assigned values and associated uncertainties were prepared by the comparison participants and sent to the coordinating laboratory for comparison. The Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs), calculated form values measured by the coordinating laboratory based on calibrations obtained from independent gravimetrically prepared calibrant solutions, agreed with participants reported values, within their stated uncertainties.</p><p>trans-ZEN was selected to be representative of non-polar Fusarium mycotoxins. It was anticipated to provide a challenge representative for the gravimetrical preparation and value assignment of calibration solutions in the mass fraction range of 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of mycotoxins with broadly similar structural characteristics.</p><p>Six participants of the MMCBKT programme were provided with a stock solution having a known trans-ZEN mass fraction and expanded uncertainty to use to gravimetrically prepare and value assign a calibration solution. Four NMIs/DIs also participated using their own calibration solutions. The use of in-house solutions required an additional capacity to undertake a fit-for-purpose purity assessment. NIM was the only NMI participating using both the MMCBKT based and their own in-house assigned solutions in order to connect the two different groups.</p><p>It was decided to propose separate KCRVs for each of the two ampoules provided by the participating NMIs/DIs based on the trans-ZEN mass fraction. This allowed participants to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation of the approaches used to gravimetrically prepare calibration solutions and to assess the trans-ZEN mass fraction.</p><p>The majority of the trans-ZEN mass fraction KCRVs (wKCRV) for CCQM-K154.a and CCQM-K154.a.1 spanned a mass fraction range of 12.18 mg/kg to 15.29 mg/kg. Solely the solutions of NRC exhibited higher trans-ZEN mass fraction KCRVs of 66.68 mg/kg and 66.90 mg/kg. The relative expanded uncertainties U(wKCRV) ranged from 0.90 % to 4.54 %.</p><p>Inspection of the degree of equivalence plots for the trans-ZEN mass fraction assignments in CCQM-K154.a indicated that there was an excellent agreement of results in general.</p><p>The CCQM-K154.a.1 subsequent comparison was organized for INTI to repeat measurements with new ampoules. The trans-ZEN mass fraction assignments of INTI within CCQM K154.a.1 were in agreement with the KCRVs.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
