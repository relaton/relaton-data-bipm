    <p>Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, and styrene (subsequently referred to gas BTEX) are volatile organic compounds emitted from gasoline, fossil fuel combustion, paints, rubber products, and adhesives. Exposure to BTEX can make adverse health effects on humans. Therefore, BTEX in both ambient and indoor air is regulated and monitored to protect public health. For this supplementary comparison, a multicomponent mixture of BTEX in nitrogen has been chosen at an amount-of-substance fraction level of 100 nmol mol<sup>âˆ’1</sup> that is more close to their emission levels from new buildings and construction materials. The supplementary comparison is designed to underpin calibration capabilities using BTEX gas mixtures that are prepared gravimetrically as transfer standards.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
