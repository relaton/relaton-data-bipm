    <p>Methane is one of the major greenhouse gases that affect climate change. To mitigate anthropogenic CH<sub>4</sub> emissions effectively, it is necessary to measure and monitor CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from the production and transport of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is important for NMIs to demonstrate measurement equivalence for the standard gases of CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
    <p>This is the third comparison on methane in nitrogen or air. The first comparison is the key comparison of CCQM-K82 (ambient level methane in air) and the second comparison is the supplementary comparison of APMP.QM-S7 (2000 μmol/mol methane in nitrogen). As a supplementary comparison, the purpose of this comparison is to study the comparability of CH<sub>4</sub> standard gas mixtures at emission level (0.05 cmol/mol - 0.5 mol/mol in nitrogen or air). Furthermore, this comparison can provide a link to APMP.QM-S7 through KRISS who participated in both previous comparisons. In this comparison, KRISS prepared gas standards and sent to participants. Each participant measured the standard on their laboratory and reported their measurement results to KRISS according to the measurement protocol.</p>
    <p>This report describes the results of a supplementary comparison for methane in nitrogen at 2000 μmol/mol.</p>
