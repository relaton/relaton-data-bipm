    <p>Supplementary comparison of distance measurements using pocket-type laser instruments (EDMs), following the previous comparison EURAMET.L-S20.</p>
    <p>Originally proposed by CEM (ES) as billateral comparison with BEV (AT), after the open call made at the 2014 EURAMET TC-L meeting, VSL (NL) joined the comparison too.</p>
    <p>Registered as Supplementary Comparison EURAMET.L-S25 with CEM acting as Coordinator and Pilot laboratory.</p>
    <p>Transfer devices were two Leica DISTO EDMs, being the measurands the distances from the rear part of the EDMs to a target plate situated at 0.3 m and every 5 m until covering a range of 50 m.</p>
