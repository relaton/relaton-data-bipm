    <p>The Supplementary comparison EURAMET.AUV.A-S2 has been carried out under the auspices of the Consultative Committee on Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). This comparison is concerned with secondary free-field methods of microphone calibration, particularly the methods described in the International Standard IEC 61094-8 (2012). The participating NMI's are BEV (Austria), DFM (Denmark), INMETRO (Brazil), INRiM (Italy), LNE (France), NPL (UK) and PTB (Germany). The role of Pilot laboratory was undertaken by LNE (France). The measurements took place between February 2014 and June 2016. Two WS2 microphones were circulated. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of equivalence degrees.</p>
