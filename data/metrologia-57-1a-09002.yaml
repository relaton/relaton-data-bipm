    <p>This document is the Final Report of the Inter-American Metrology System supplementary comparison on pistonphone calibration SIM.AUV.A-S2. Seven national metrology institutes participated on this comparison: CENAM/Mexico, INACAL/Peru, INMETRO/Brazil, INTI/Argentina, LACOMET/Costa Rica, NIST/USA and NRC/Canada and INMETRO was the pilot institute responsible for its coordination. One pistonphone was circulated among the participants to carry out calibrations according to the international standard IEC 60942:2017 using both LS1P and LS2P measurement microphones. Beyond the mandatory measurement of the sound pressure level, it was requested to the participants report measurement results of frequency, total harmonic distortion and total distortion + noise for the purpose of investigation. For sound pressure level and frequency measurement results, supplementary comparison reference values (SCRVs) were determined using the weighted mean method and the corresponding degrees of equivalence obtained between each participant and the SCRV are presented. For total harmonic distortion and total distortion + noise measurements, SCRVs were not calculated and the values reported by participants are compared with the calculated arithmetic mean and weighted mean values. Overall, the supplementary comparison SIM.AUV.A-S2 was considered successful and fits its purpose.</p><p>Main text</p><p>
