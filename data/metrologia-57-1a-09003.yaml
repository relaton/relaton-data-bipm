    <p>This final report describes the results obtained in a key comparison of primary vibration calibration facilities. Two piezoelectric standard accelerometers (one single-ended as well one back-to-back type) were calibrated first at Central Office of Measures (GUM), acting as pilot and linking laboratory, and Bulgarian Institute for Metrology (BIM). The results of the BIM obtained in this comparison were linked to the CCAUV.V-K2 key comparison through the joint participation of the GUM. The degrees of equivalence were computed for BIM with respect to the CCAUV.V-K2 key comparison reference value.</p>
