abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This document brings together the definitions and the tables
    of numerical values for photometry already adopted (or recommended) and published,
    by the Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM), by the Comité International
    des Poids et Mesures (CIPM), or by the Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage
    (CIE). This document provides the link between the definition of the candela in
    the International System of Units (SI) and the internationally agreed spectral
    luminous efficiency functions for human vision published by the CIE, including
    those for mesopic vision and for photopic vision for a 10° field of view, in addition
    to those for photopic vision for a 2° field of view and for scotopic vision. The
    definitions of photometric units and quantities have also been updated with the
    reformulated definition of the candela in the International System of Units (SI)
    2019 and the latest definitions of the photometric quantities by the CIE.</p>
