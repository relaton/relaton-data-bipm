abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This discussion considers the challenge of making amendments
    to the International System of Units (SI) in terms of the varying levels of adoption
    of these amendments by users of the SI. It categorises possible amendments along
    two scales. First, whether these are changes or additions to the SI; and second
    whether these amendments are optional or compulsory. Where amendments fall on
    these two scales gives an indication of whether they are low-risk or high-risk
    actions, in terms of their likely adoption by users of the SI and the confusion
    that lack of adoption might cause. Proposed amendments to the SI of current interest
    are considered with respect to this framework.</p>
