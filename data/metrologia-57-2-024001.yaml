abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Measurements of the refractive indices of helium and argon
    using a quasi-spherical microwave resonator and upgraded experimental protocol
    are reported at the temperatures of the triple points of water and xenon. The
    results at the triple point of water are used to determine the compressibility
    of the resonating cavity, which is bounded by the copper shell of the resonator.
    This experimentally-determined compressibility is consistent with the literature
    value for copper, but with much smaller measurement uncertainty. The measured
    compressibility is extrapolated to the triple point of xenon, and combined with
    the refractive index results at that temperature to determine the thermodynamic
    accuracy of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90): mK at ITS-90
    temperature K, corresponding to a xenon triple point thermodynamic temperature
    of K. The experimental compressibility is further extrapolated to the triple points
    of argon, oxygen and neon, and used to re-analyze earlier refractive index gas
    thermometry measurements made using the same resonator, yielding updated values
    with reduced uncertainties: mK at T<sub>90</sub>  =  83.8058 K, mK at T<sub>90</sub>  =  54.3584
    K, and mK at T<sub>90</sub>  =  24.5561 K. The ITS-90 thermodynamic accuracy results
    of the present refractive index gas thermometry study agree with those previously
    reported by acoustic gas thermometry and dielectric constant gas thermometry.</p>'
