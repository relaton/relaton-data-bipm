abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Equations are derived for propagating the uncertainties contributing
    to the blackbody corrections for the calibration of low-temperature radiation
    thermometers operating over a spectral range near the 8 µm–14 µm band. These equations
    include the full Planck treatment of spectral radiance, which is necessary at
    these long wavelengths, and account for the thermometer bandwidth. The influence
    quantities include the source emissivity, reference temperature, reflected ambient
    radiation, detector temperature, and spectral responsivity. Various cases are
    considered when using either a blackbody cavity or a flat-plate calibrator as
    the calibration source, and when using a contact thermometer or a radiation thermometer
    as the reference. Total uncertainties tend to be smallest when a radiation thermometer
    is used as the reference as, in this case, the influence of the source emissivity
    is minimised.</p>
