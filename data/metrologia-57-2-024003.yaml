    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the paper, an in-house W/Re thermocouple was calibrated at the eutectic fixed points of Pd-C (1492 °C), Pt-C (1738 °C) and Ru-C (1953 °C). To correct the temperature error caused by the thermal conduction of the thermocouple sheath, a linear extrapolation method was developed to determine the emf of the thermocouple based on the melting and freezing values at the eutectic fixed points realized with different offset furnace temperatures. In a simpler approach, the average of the melting and freezing values was also used. The results showed that the temperatures corresponding to the emfs derived from the linear extrapolation and the average method agreed (1–2) °C with the standard reference values of type-C thermocouple in the temperature range studied.</p>
