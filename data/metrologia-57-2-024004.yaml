abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The determination of the differences (T–T<sub>90</sub>) between
    the thermodynamic temperature T and the international temperature scale of 1990
    (ITS-90) T<sub>90</sub>, is important for an evaluation of the approximation to
    T by T<sub>90</sub>. Such evaluations are necessary for the potential revision
    of ITS-90. A number of efforts have been devoted to the determination of (T–T<sub>90</sub>)
    by the acoustic gas thermometry (AGT) using spherical or quasi-spherical resonators.
    We report in this paper a new study in the temperature range from 234 K to 303
    K using AGT in argon with a cylindrical resonator. Piezo-electric acoustic transducers
    were used to measure the acoustic resonant frequencies. The resonant frequencies
    of the transverse magnetic microwave modes of the cavity were measured using straight
    probe antennas. This work further illustrates the high performance of the microwave
    resonant procedure to measure the thermal expansion of a cylindrical cavity at
    different temperatures and pressures. The (T–T<sub>90</sub>) measurements, with
    standard uncertainties in the range from 0.5 mK to 0.8 mK, agree well with the
    existing data from AGT with spherical or quasi-spherical resonators. We believe
    that cylindrical acoustic gas thermometry, with an uncertainty comparable with
    that using spherical or quasi-spherical resonators but simpler mechanical assembly,
    has the potential for accurate measurements of (T–T<sub>90</sub>) at higher temperatures.</p><p></p>
