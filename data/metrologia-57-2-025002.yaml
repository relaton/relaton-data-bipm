abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Despite ubiquitous implementation of the quartz crystal microbalance
    (QCM) for measuring thin film thickness throughout industry and academia, a direct
    link to the SI (International System of Units) does not exist. Confidence in QCM
    measurements relies on over a half-a-century of academic and industrial research
    used to understand the resonant frequency change due to loading mass onto a quartz
    crystal. Here, we use before and after gravimetric mass measurements, linked directly
    to the SI, to measure mass change. A custom vacuum metal deposition system is
    used to deposit gold films of various masses onto a series of quartz crystals
    while the mass dependent frequency change is monitored in real time. The gravimetric
    (known) mass changes are compared to three analytical methods (frequency, time
    and energy) used to convert resonant frequency shifts to mass changes, none of
    which rely on the material properties of the deposited material. Additionally,
    we evaluate the reversible and irreversible contributions to mass change from
    the loading into, and removal from, the vacuum environment. We find the energy-based
    method for frequency to mass conversion has the best accuracy over the longest
    range, at 0.36 % to  &gt;1 mg. Only for mass changes below 100 are deviations  &gt;2 %
    observed. A complete uncertainty budget is provided.</p>
