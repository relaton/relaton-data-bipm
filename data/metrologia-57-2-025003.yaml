abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we present both the design details and uncertainty
    budget for a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-developed high-accuracy
    Fizeau-type interferometer specifically adapted to measurement sphere diameter.
    To do this, we provide some historic details of the instrument’s origins, an explanation
    of the clever accuracy-improving enhancements integrated into the design over
    the past several decades, and a detailed discussion of the role automation has
    played in achieving its current world-class accuracy. With utmost attention to
    the dominating components of a detailed uncertainty budget, we methodically improved
    a rather dated instrument design into a high-accuracy state-of-the-art system
    for sphere diameter measurement with an expanded uncertainty, U(k  =  2), of less
    than  ±10 nm for spheres with nominal diameters of between 0.4 mm and 26 mm. We
    conclude with a brief description of a novel application of this instrument for
    determining the phase-change upon reflection correction for both gauge blocks
    and gauge block platens. Applying corrections for phase-change upon reflection
    differences between different surfaces, gauge block and platen, is critically
    important for high-accuracy interferometric gauge block length measurements.</p>
