    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report on an inter-laboratory comparison for the calibration of light-scattering optical particle counters measuring the number concentration of airborne particles in the size range 300 nm–5 µm. This comparison, registered as EURAMET pilot study Nr. 1453, is an important first step towards internationally recognized SI traceability in the measurement of low particle number concentrations encountered in clean-room facilities. The participating particle metrology laboratories of NMIJ (Japan), DFM (Denmark) and METAS (Switzerland) each provided a portable optical particle counter as a transfer standard to be circulated amongst the partners. The comparison covered particle number concentrations up to about 2 cm<sup>−3</sup>. The individual measurements for the transfer standards at each laboratory are in good agreement with the reference value, typically within 7%, which supports the applied national primary methods of measurement.</p>
