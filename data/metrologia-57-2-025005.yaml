abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on an inter-laboratory comparison for the calibration
    of light-scattering optical particle counters measuring the number concentration
    of airborne particles in the size range 300 nm–5 µm. This comparison, registered
    as EURAMET pilot study Nr. 1453, is an important first step towards internationally
    recognized SI traceability in the measurement of low particle number concentrations
    encountered in clean-room facilities. The participating particle metrology laboratories
    of NMIJ (Japan), DFM (Denmark) and METAS (Switzerland) each provided a portable
    optical particle counter as a transfer standard to be circulated amongst the partners.
    The comparison covered particle number concentrations up to about 2 cm<sup>−3</sup>.
    The individual measurements for the transfer standards at each laboratory are
    in good agreement with the reference value, typically within 7%, which supports
    the applied national primary methods of measurement.</p>
