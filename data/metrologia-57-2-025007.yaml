abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The state-of-the-art ab initio potentials and interaction-induced
    isotropic polarizabilities in the literature are used to calculate the second
    dielectric virial coefficient of helium-4, helium-3, neon, and argon. The statistical-mechanics
    formulations with quantum corrections up to second order as well as the [1/1]
    Padé approximant are employed to compute the dielectric virial coefficient down
    to the temperature of 25 K. The uncertainties of the calculated dielectric virial
    coefficient values are evaluated from the corresponding estimated uncertainties
    of the potentials and the polarizabilities. In addition, the second dielectric
    virial coefficient of helium-4 is determined by the principle of analogy for the
    temperature further down to 5 K. The comparisons with the available experimental
    and theoretical data demonstrate that our results given in the supplementary materials
    are more accurate and can be used as recommended values in scientific studies
    relating to the dielectric virial coefficient of helium, neon, and argon.</p>
