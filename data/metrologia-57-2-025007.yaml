    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The state-of-the-art <italic>ab initio</italic> potentials and interaction-induced isotropic polarizabilities in the literature are used to calculate the second dielectric virial coefficient of helium-4, helium-3, neon, and argon. The statistical-mechanics formulations with quantum corrections up to second order as well as the [1/1] Padé approximant are employed to compute the dielectric virial coefficient down to the temperature of 25 K. The uncertainties of the calculated dielectric virial coefficient values are evaluated from the corresponding estimated uncertainties of the potentials and the polarizabilities. In addition, the second dielectric virial coefficient of helium-4 is determined by the principle of analogy for the temperature further down to 5 K. The comparisons with the available experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that our results given in the supplementary materials are more accurate and can be used as recommended values in scientific studies relating to the dielectric virial coefficient of helium, neon, and argon.</p>
