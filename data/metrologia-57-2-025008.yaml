abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We determined the non-linearity coefficients of RAMSES hyper-spectral
    radiometers by relying on measurements performed at two distances from a reference
    source, i.e. d<sub>C</sub> and, leading to equivalent digital counts in a large
    portion of the spectrum when doubling the integration time. Results from the proposed
    two-distance method are comparable to those obtained through a comprehensive characterization
    based on multi-distance measurements. Specifically, the differences between the
    non-linearity coefficients obtained from the two characterization approaches exhibit
    values lower than their respective standard deviations over most of the spectral
    range, except for the blue spectral region due to operational limits of the multi-distance
    method. This finding supports the use of the simpler two-distance method for the
    characterization of the non-linearity coefficients of individual instruments,
    opposite to the application of the non-linearity coefficients recently recommended
    for the entire class hyperspectral radiometers matter of this investigation.</p>
