    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We determined the non-linearity coefficients of RAMSES hyper-spectral radiometers by relying on measurements performed at two distances from a reference source, i.e. <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab6277ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab6277ieqn002.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>, leading to equivalent digital counts in a large portion of the spectrum when doubling the integration time. Results from the proposed two-distance method are comparable to those obtained through a comprehensive characterization based on multi-distance measurements. Specifically, the differences between the non-linearity coefficients obtained from the two characterization approaches exhibit values lower than their respective standard deviations over most of the spectral range, except for the blue spectral region due to operational limits of the multi-distance method. This finding supports the use of the simpler two-distance method for the characterization of the non-linearity coefficients of individual instruments, opposite to the application of the non-linearity coefficients recently recommended for the entire class hyperspectral radiometers matter of this investigation.</p>
