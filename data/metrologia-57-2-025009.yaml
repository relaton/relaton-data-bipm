abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Pt and Rh oxide vapour transport is thought to dominate the
    thermoelectric drift of Pt-Rh thermocouples above about 1200 °C. A simple model
    is presented which relates the electromotive force (emf) drift rate of Pt-Rh thermoelements
    to the vapour pressure of Pt and Rh oxides. The model assumes that the evaporation
    of these oxides gives rise to a continuously changing concentration of Pt and
    Rh, at different rates along the length of the wires, which causes a change in
    the Seebeck coefficient. The model has been tested by comparison with high precision
    measurements of the thermoelectric drift of a Pt-Rh thermocouple assembly consisting
    of five thermoelements, repeatedly exposed to the melting of a Co-C high temperature
    fixed point (1324 °C) for a total duration of 500 h. By considering various thermocouples
    of different compositions, it is demonstrated that the calculated drift rate is
    proportional to the measured drift rate, which represents a validation of the
    model.</p>
