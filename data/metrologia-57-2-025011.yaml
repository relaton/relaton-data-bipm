    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Temperature and humidity sensitivity coefficients of torque transducers should be determined to improve the degree of equivalence among participants of key comparisons when torque transducers are used as transfer artifacts or secondary standards. Our experiments revealed that the temperature sensitivity coefficient of a torque transfer standard could have values that are up to eight times greater than the specified value in its datasheet, which results in an error of 0.008% from a variation of 1 K in the ambient conditions of a laboratory. This report presents a simple and cost-effective method to determine temperature and humidity sensitivity coefficients using natural and seasonal changes in the ambient conditions of a laboratory. We developed a measurement protocol, a mathematical model, and an uncertainty estimation scheme based on a Monte Carlo simulation. A spreadsheet template is also provided for users to easily follow our method and determine the values with associated uncertainties. This method was cross-checked with another method that employs a humidity-controllable chamber that surrounds a transfer artifact.</p>
