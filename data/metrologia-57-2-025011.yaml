abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Temperature and humidity sensitivity coefficients of torque
    transducers should be determined to improve the degree of equivalence among participants
    of key comparisons when torque transducers are used as transfer artifacts or secondary
    standards. Our experiments revealed that the temperature sensitivity coefficient
    of a torque transfer standard could have values that are up to eight times greater
    than the specified value in its datasheet, which results in an error of 0.008%
    from a variation of 1 K in the ambient conditions of a laboratory. This report
    presents a simple and cost-effective method to determine temperature and humidity
    sensitivity coefficients using natural and seasonal changes in the ambient conditions
    of a laboratory. We developed a measurement protocol, a mathematical model, and
    an uncertainty estimation scheme based on a Monte Carlo simulation. A spreadsheet
    template is also provided for users to easily follow our method and determine
    the values with associated uncertainties. This method was cross-checked with another
    method that employs a humidity-controllable chamber that surrounds a transfer
    artifact.</p>
