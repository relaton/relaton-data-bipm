    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A silicon electron pump operating at the temperature of liquid helium has demonstrated repeatable operation with sub-ppm accuracy. The pump current, approximately 168 pA, is measured by three laboratories, and the measurements agree with the expected current <italic>ef</italic> within the uncertainties which range from 0.2 ppm to 1.3 ppm. All the measurements are carried out in zero applied magnetic field, and the pump drive signal is a sine wave. The combination of simple operating conditions with high accuracy demonstrates the possibility that an electron pump can operate as a current standard in a National Measurement Institute. We also discuss other practical aspects of using the electron pump as a current standard, such as testing its robustness to changes in the control parameters, and using a rapid tuning procedure to locate the optimal operation point. </p>
