abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A silicon electron pump operating at the temperature of liquid
    helium has demonstrated repeatable operation with sub-ppm accuracy. The pump current,
    approximately 168 pA, is measured by three laboratories, and the measurements
    agree with the expected current ef within the uncertainties which range from 0.2
    ppm to 1.3 ppm. All the measurements are carried out in zero applied magnetic
    field, and the pump drive signal is a sine wave. The combination of simple operating
    conditions with high accuracy demonstrates the possibility that an electron pump
    can operate as a current standard in a National Measurement Institute. We also
    discuss other practical aspects of using the electron pump as a current standard,
    such as testing its robustness to changes in the control parameters, and using
    a rapid tuning procedure to locate the optimal operation point.</p>
