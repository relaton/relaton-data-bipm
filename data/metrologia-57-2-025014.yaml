abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper describes a new relative technique developed at LNE-Cnam,
    for the determination of the thermodynamic temperature of blackbodies without
    recourse to a radiometric reference. This technique is referred to as the ‘synthetic
    double wavelength technique’ (SDWT) as it is considered to be a particular case
    of the ‘double wavelength technique’ (DWT). It offers a new experimental technique
    for the determination of the thermodynamic temperature at high temperature and
    as such a new means for the mise-en-pratique of the new definition of the kelvin
    achievable by any national metrology institute provided a multi-wavelength radiation
    thermometer combining large and narrow bandwidths is available. In this work,
    a first experimental implementation of this technique based on a wavelength-tuneable
    spectroradiometer providing both narrowband and broadband signals with the particularity
    of the broadband signal being virtually synthesised from the spectral distribution
    of the narrowband signals sampled over a wide spectral range. SDWT determination
    of the thermodynamic temperature of a blackbody at 2760 K was performed with a
    level of uncertainty that confirms the promising capabilities of this technique.</p>
