abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Isotope dilution is among the most accurate quantitation approaches
    in chemical analysis. This calibration method is often employed using a plurality
    of mathematical formulations. While most analysts find the calibration curve approach
    most appealing, there is a lack of rigorous general procedures involving calibration
    curves in isotope dilution and analysts resort to empirical polynomial calibration
    functions. In this contribution we discuss the adoption of regression analysis,
    commonly known as least squares methods, to solve isotope dilution equations of
    varied complexity. This manuscript introduces general regression-based methods
    to isotope dilution applicable to all known variants of classical isotope dilution
    known to date, including the fusion of the isotope dilution and standard additions
    methods.</p>
