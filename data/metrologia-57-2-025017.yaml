abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Partial pressure measurement has become indispensable for many
    applications and contributes to the complete characterization of a vacuum system.
    In this work, an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) standard was established for calibrating
    partial pressure analyzers as a partial pressure standard, and a new method was
    introduced to generate standard partial pressures, which was named ‘the dynamic
    expansion method based on static expansion vacuum standard injection mode’. The
    method can produce standard partial pressures in the range from 10<sup>–5</sup>
    Pa to 10<sup>–10</sup> Pa. The relative standard uncertainty budgets of generated
    partial pressures (k = 1) were in the range from 2.8% up to 5.0% from 10<sup>–5</sup>
    Pa to 10<sup>–9</sup> Pa for nitrogen. Employing this method, the sensitivity
    calibrations of quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) were performed in the partial
    pressure range of 8.62 × 10<sup>−5</sup> Pa to 1.51 × 10<sup>−10</sup> Pa with
    single inert He, Ar, and Kr gas in secondary electron multiplier (SEM) mode. Similarly,
    the calibrations were carried out using active gases (H<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>,
    N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>) in the range 8.56 × 10<sup>−5</sup>
    Pa to 1.50 × 10<sup>−9</sup> Pa. Additionally, the SEM gains were calibrated for
    these high-purity gases, on the basis of SEM gain coefficients. QMS sensitivities
    equivalent to Faraday cup mode were attained, and it was found that the results
    were approximately consistent with those of previous studies. The data were also
    in agreement with our theoretical calculation values excluding CH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
