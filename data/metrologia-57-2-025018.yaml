abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We demonstrate a simple adaptation of the venerable Hilger–Watts
    gauge-block interferometer capable of performing automated, traceable calibrations
    of gauge block length by phase-stepping interferometry (PSI). We discuss the selection
    of robust PSI filtering algorithms to counteract in software the flaws of the
    hardware implementation, including markedly non-sinusoidal fringes and inhomogeneous
    phase step size. We find that the length measurement errors attributable to the
    phase measurement can be reduced to 0.6 nm, even with a simple retrofit to an
    instrument not originally designed for PSI.</p>
