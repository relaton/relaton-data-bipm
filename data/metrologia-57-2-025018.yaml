    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We demonstrate a simple adaptation of the venerable Hilger–Watts gauge-block interferometer capable of performing automated, traceable calibrations of gauge block length by phase-stepping interferometry (PSI). We discuss the selection of robust PSI filtering algorithms to counteract in software the flaws of the hardware implementation, including markedly non-sinusoidal fringes and inhomogeneous phase step size. We find that the length measurement errors attributable to the phase measurement can be reduced to 0.6 nm, even with a simple retrofit to an instrument not originally designed for PSI. </p>
