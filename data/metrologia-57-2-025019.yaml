    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The use of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for time transfer is widespread, in particular for the computation of the coordinated universal time (UTC). It is an inexpensive, easy-to-implement method to compare distant clocks. This time transfer method can also be applied to the monitoring of the GNSS time scales and of the broadcast UTC conversion parameters. One mission of the French space agency (CNES) is to perform this task for Galileo. For that purpose it is mandatory to carry out an absolute calibration of the propagation delay of a GNSS receiver chain. This propagation delay is the one between the GNSS antenna phase centre and the time reference that feeds the receiver chain. In order to allow a link to UTC, the time reference must be a UTC(<italic>k</italic>).</p>
    <p>CNES has developed a method of absolute calibration of GNSS receiver chains, in which the delays of the GNSS antenna, the antenna cable and the GNSS receiver are determined separately, with a total uncertainty in the range of 1 ns (1 – <italic>σ</italic>). The purpose of this paper is to present the method developed by CNES along with its uncertainty budget for GPS, Galileo and BeiDou signals. A validation in common-clock with actual GPS and Galileo signals is also provided. The absolute calibration is finally applied to an accurate monitoring of the GNSS time scales, the Galileo broadcast UTC conversion parameters and the broadcast Galileo to GPS time offset (GGTO), with associated uncertainties.</p>
