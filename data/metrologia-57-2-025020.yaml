    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>For reduction of the cylindricity evaluation uncertainty for large rotating components with large radius and height, the cylindrical profile measurement model is designed with multi-systematic error considering eccentricity, probe offset, probe radius, geometric axis tilt, support rod tilt, and guide rail tilt. In addition, an error separation method is proposed based on the multi-systematic error measurement model. The combined influence of multi-systematic error on the measurement results is analyzed, and cylindricity results are evaluated based on the proposed method. It is verified that, compared with other measurement models, the cylindrical profile measurement model with six systematic errors is the most accurate and stable in the standard cylindrical component measurements using a large high-precision cylindricity measuring instrument. In this experiment, compared with the cylindrical profile measurement model with two systematic errors, the cylindricity evaluation uncertainty obtained by the proposed method reduces from 55.2 µm to 21.0 µm with increasing radius and height of the standard cylindrical component. The proposed method is especially suitable for the cylindrical component measurements with large radius and height. The paper provides an accurate measurement model for high-precision error separation, tolerance allocation and cylindricity comparison for accredited laboratories, national metrology institutes etc.</p>
