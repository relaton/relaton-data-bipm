abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>For reduction of the cylindricity evaluation uncertainty for
    large rotating components with large radius and height, the cylindrical profile
    measurement model is designed with multi-systematic error considering eccentricity,
    probe offset, probe radius, geometric axis tilt, support rod tilt, and guide rail
    tilt. In addition, an error separation method is proposed based on the multi-systematic
    error measurement model. The combined influence of multi-systematic error on the
    measurement results is analyzed, and cylindricity results are evaluated based
    on the proposed method. It is verified that, compared with other measurement models,
    the cylindrical profile measurement model with six systematic errors is the most
    accurate and stable in the standard cylindrical component measurements using a
    large high-precision cylindricity measuring instrument. In this experiment, compared
    with the cylindrical profile measurement model with two systematic errors, the
    cylindricity evaluation uncertainty obtained by the proposed method reduces from
    55.2 µm to 21.0 µm with increasing radius and height of the standard cylindrical
    component. The proposed method is especially suitable for the cylindrical component
    measurements with large radius and height. The paper provides an accurate measurement
    model for high-precision error separation, tolerance allocation and cylindricity
    comparison for accredited laboratories, national metrology institutes etc.</p>
