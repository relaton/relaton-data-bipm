abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The use of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) for time
    transfer is widespread, in particular for the computation of the coordinated universal
    time (UTC). It is an inexpensive, easy-to-implement method to compare distant
    clocks. This time transfer method can also be applied to the monitoring of the
    GNSS time scales and of the broadcast UTC conversion parameters. One mission of
    the French space agency (CNES) is to perform this task for Galileo. For that purpose
    it is mandatory to carry out an absolute calibration of the propagation delay
    of a GNSS receiver chain. This propagation delay is the one between the GNSS antenna
    phase centre and the time reference that feeds the receiver chain. In order to
    allow a link to UTC, the time reference must be a UTC(k).</p><p>CNES has developed
    a method of absolute calibration of GNSS receiver chains, in which the delays
    of the GNSS antenna, the antenna cable and the GNSS receiver are determined separately,
    with a total uncertainty in the range of 1 ns (1 – σ). The purpose of this paper
    is to present the method developed by CNES along with its uncertainty budget for
    GPS, Galileo and BeiDou signals. A validation in common-clock with actual GPS
    and Galileo signals is also provided. The absolute calibration is finally applied
    to an accurate monitoring of the GNSS time scales, the Galileo broadcast UTC conversion
    parameters and the broadcast Galileo to GPS time offset (GGTO), with associated
    uncertainties.</p>
