abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We report the realization of the first cold-atom primary standard.
    This standard is based on a universal law governing quantum diffractive collisions
    between particles that allows an experimental determination of the velocity averaged
    total collision cross section, the only parameter required to quantify the pressure
    or flux of particles given a sensor particle collision rate measurement. Using
    an ensemble of<sup>87</sup>Rb sensor atoms, we show that this new quantum pressure
    standard can be applied to gases of both atomic (He, Ar, and Xe) and molecular
    species (\nN2, \nCO2, and \nH2), surpassing the scope of existing orifice flow
    pressure standards. We verify the accuracy of this new standard using an ionization
    gauge (IG) calibrated for N<sub>2</sub> by an orifice flow standard. The gauge
    calibration factors determined by the cold atom and orifice flow standards differ
    by less than 0.5% and, thus, agree within their uncertainties of 2% and 2.8% respectively.
    Using this standard, we evaluate the response of two different IGs to a variety
    of different gas species and report variations of up to 20% for their measured
    calibration factors. We also observe a non-linear response of the IG readings
    for CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Finally, we demonstrate the use of a magneto-optical trap
    (MOT) as a transfer standard to extend the measurement range by a factor of 100
    to include pressures up to P ~ 10<sup>−5</sup> Pa.</p>"
