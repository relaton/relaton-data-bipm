abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the paper, an in-house W/Re thermocouple was calibrated at
    the eutectic fixed points of Pd-C (1492 °C), Pt-C (1738 °C) and Ru-C (1953 °C).
    To correct the temperature error caused by the thermal conduction of the thermocouple
    sheath, a linear extrapolation method was developed to determine the emf of the
    thermocouple based on the melting and freezing values at the eutectic fixed points
    realized with different offset furnace temperatures. In a simpler approach, the
    average of the melting and freezing values was also used. The results showed that
    the temperatures corresponding to the emfs derived from the linear extrapolation
    and the average method agreed (1–2) °C with the standard reference values of type-C
    thermocouple in the temperature range studied.</p>
