abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In order to fulfil its mission to ensure and promote the global
    comparability of measurements, the BIPM operates laboratories in the fields of
    physical metrology, time, ionizing radiation and chemistry. These laboratories
    act as centres for scientific and technical collaboration between Member States
    providing capabilities for international measurement comparisons on a shared-cost
    basis. They coordinate international comparisons of national measurement standards
    agreed to be of the highest priority, and they establish and maintain appropriate
    reference standards for use as the basis of key international comparisons at the
    highest level and provide selected calibrations from them.</p><p>In the following
    sections, we provide highlights of the work they have undertaken during 2019.</p>
