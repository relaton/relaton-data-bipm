abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In 2017, PMOD/WRC organised the solar ultraviolet broadband
    radiometer comparison campaign UVC-II. All 75 participating instruments from all
    over the world were characterised in the laboratory of the World Calibration Center
    for UV (WCCUV) and calibrated outdoors relative to the Qasume reference spectroradiometer.
    After a three month calibration period, all devices were returned to their owners,
    accompanied by a certificate demonstrating traceability to the international system
    of units. The calibration uncertainty stated in these certificates was less than
    6% for the majority of the radiometers. The deviation to the original calibration
    factors was analysed. From this data we determined three components affecting
    the overall measurement uncertainty of solar UV measurements using broadband radiometers
    on different time scales: Usage of additional correction factors to the absolute
    calibration factor, control of the humidity inside the device and recalibration
    frequency. A subset of radiometers participating in the campaign were calibrated
    and characterised at their home laboratories. A comparison of the calibration
    factors shows that the USER- and the WCCUV-calibrations agree within the uncertainties
    for 9 out of 11 calibrations.</p>'
