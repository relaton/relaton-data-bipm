abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In this paper, the sensing characteristics of a photonic crystal
    fiber (PCF) Sagnac interferometer based on flat-phase birefringence, zero-group
    birefringence and the Vernier effect have been studied. The temperature-sensitive
    liquid is filled into the air holes of the PCF. We realize flat-phase birefringence,
    by which the sensitivity can reach 4.9 nm/°C and 3.5 nm/°C. We find a new phenomenon
    in that there are more interference fringes appearing near the zero-group-birefringence
    wavelength with the environment changing. Highly sensitive sensors with −19.9
    nm/°C and 28.6 nm/°C are obtained. We also demonstrate that two cascaded Sagnac
    interferometers based on PCF can realize the Vernier effect. The sensitivities
    are 1 nm/°C (single Sagnac interferometer) and 10.4 nm/°C (cascaded Sagnac interferometers),
    and the sensitivity is improved by more than 10 times. The sensitivity is inversely
    proportional to the difference between free spectral range (FSR)<sub>1</sub> and
    FSR<sub>2</sub>, and the highest sensitivity reaches 23.2 nm/°C (−58 500 nm/RIU,
    resolution: 3.419× 10<sup>−7</sup> RIU) by optimizing the PCF length in Sagnac
    interferometer 2. The average sensitivity based on two cascaded PCF Sagnac interferometers
    is up to −309 957 nm/RIU and the resolution is 6.453× 10<sup>−8</sup> RIU as the
    refractive index of the analyte varies from 1.33 to 1.331, which is very competitive
    in the field of chemical sensing.</p>'
