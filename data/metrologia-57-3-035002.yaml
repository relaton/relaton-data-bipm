    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In this paper, the sensing characteristics of a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) Sagnac interferometer based on flat-phase birefringence, zero-group birefringence and the Vernier effect have been studied. The temperature-sensitive liquid is filled into the air holes of the PCF. We realize flat-phase birefringence, by which the sensitivity can reach 4.9 nm/°C and 3.5 nm/°C. We find a new phenomenon in that there are more interference fringes appearing near the zero-group-birefringence wavelength with the environment changing. Highly sensitive sensors with −19.9 nm/°C and 28.6 nm/°C are obtained. We also demonstrate that two cascaded Sagnac interferometers based on PCF can realize the Vernier effect. The sensitivities are 1 nm/°C (single Sagnac interferometer) and 10.4 nm/°C (cascaded Sagnac interferometers), and the sensitivity is improved by more than 10 times. The sensitivity is inversely proportional to the difference between free spectral range (FSR)<sub>1</sub> and FSR<sub>2</sub>, and the highest sensitivity reaches 23.2 nm/°C (−58 500 nm/RIU, resolution: 3.419× 10<sup>−7</sup> RIU) by optimizing the PCF length in Sagnac interferometer 2. The average sensitivity based on two cascaded PCF Sagnac interferometers is up to −309 957 nm/RIU and the resolution is 6.453× 10<sup>−8</sup> RIU as the refractive index of the analyte varies from 1.33 to 1.331, which is very competitive in the field of chemical sensing.</p>
