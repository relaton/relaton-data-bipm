abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The thermal metrology community is considering revising the
    International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90), motivated by the opportunity
    to improve the thermodynamic accuracy, reproducibility, and ease of use of the
    scale, as well as health and safety concerns with the use of mercury in the current
    scale. This paper considers the mathematical structure of the standard platinum
    resistance thermometer (SPRT) interpolations of the ITS-90 and identifies (i)
    mathematical features that are advantageous and should be retained, (ii) opportunities
    for improvements, and (iii) the research required to maximise the benefits from
    such improvements. The improvements considered include minor adjustments that
    leave ITS-90 intact, numerical adjustments to reference resistance ratios that
    preserve the structure of ITS-90, fixed-point replacements, new subranges, and
    large-scale changes in the mathematical structure of the interpolations. A significant
    research effort will be required to implement some of the changes. Overall, an
    improvement in the thermodynamic accuracy by a factor of about ten is relatively
    easily realised, but improvements in reproducibility of the scale of even a couple
    of tens of percent will be hard won. For most users, the costs and inconvenience
    of a substantial scale revision may outweigh the benefits.</p>
