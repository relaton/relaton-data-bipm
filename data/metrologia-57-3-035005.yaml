abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Analyses of chloride ions, and oxyanions of chlorine named
    hypochlorite, chlorite, chlorate and perchlorate ions, are of interest especially
    in the fields of controlling water and food qualities. Some of them do not exist
    as a certified reference material characterized by a metrologically valid procedure,
    and the lack of the standards currently creates problems with the instrumental
    analyses. This paper describes an accurate multipath titrimetric determination
    technique for potassium perchlorate to establish the perchlorate ion standard
    solution as a certified reference material: acidimetric coulometric titration
    with cation exchange resin, oxidation-reduction gravimetric titration, and precipitation
    gravimetric titration. The gravimetric titrations and the coulometric titration
    are capable of ensuring the traceability of the mass fraction of perchlorate ions
    and cations in potassium perchlorate respectively to the International System
    of Units. The comprehensive evaluation of the uncertainties for potassium perchlorate
    assays was carried out, resulting in the establishment of the standard for perchlorate
    determinations.</p>'
