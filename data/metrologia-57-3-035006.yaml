However, our research shows that by coupling itself with both the atomic initial velocity and the laser detuning, the short pulse duration can contribute to unknown systematic errors within the current instrument sensitivity. The coupling of the pulse duration with the laser detuning inside the device is verified experimentally and presented in this work. An improved pulse sequence design is developed to eliminate these systematic errors and improve the precision of the rotation measurements.</p>
