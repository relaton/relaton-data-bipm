abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>While conventional shock tubes have a distinct advantage in
    dynamic calibration methods due to their inherent capability to generate pressure
    pulses of desired amplitude and fast rise time, they are limited to the lower
    levels of the pressure amplitude realization range (≤7 MPa). With the increasing
    need for a traceable dynamic calibration standard across wider pressure ranges,
    a novel technique using converging shock waves is demonstrated in this work that
    pushes the upper limit of the standard shock tube into the medium-high pressure
    range. The experiments are conducted in the shock tube facility equipped with
    a test section that smoothly transforms the incident plane shock into a spherical
    shock wave that converges, accelerates and thereby amplifies its strength many
    folds. The experimentally recorded pressure traces are compared with numerical
    simulations performed by an in-house code. Using this technique, pressure pulses
    with peak amplitudes in the range of 30–40 MPa, with \n&lt; 3.4% uncertainty based
    on numerical reference profile, were realized in the test section with nominal
    usage of resources.</p>"
