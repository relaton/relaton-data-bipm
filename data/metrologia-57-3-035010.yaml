abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the first accuracy evaluation of NRC-FCs2, an atomic
    fountain clock developed at the National Research Council Canada. The short term
    stability at high atomic density is 1.1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> at 1 second of averaging
    time. The typical overall fractional type B uncertainty is 2.3 × 10<sup>−16</sup>.
    GNSS-based frequency comparisons of NRC-FCs2 with the SI second, as reported by
    the BIPM over fourteen months, give a fractional frequency difference of −2.4(3.7)
    × 10<sup>−16</sup>.</p>
