    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report the first accuracy evaluation of NRC-FCs2, an atomic fountain clock developed at the National Research Council Canada. The short term stability at high atomic density is 1.1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> at 1 second of averaging time. The typical overall fractional type B uncertainty is 2.3 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. GNSS-based frequency comparisons of NRC-FCs2 with the SI second, as reported by the BIPM over fourteen months, give a fractional frequency difference of −2.4(3.7) × 10<sup>−16</sup>.</p>
