abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Two pure Ni cells for thermocouple calibration were fabricated
    in alumina crucibles with different internal structures to investigate their melting
    and freezing behaviors. One of the produced crucibles had a smooth surface, and
    the other was made with internal circular grooves. The melting and freezing processes
    of each cell were investigated in 10 melting/freezing cycles using a type B thermocouple
    calibrated with a standard radiation thermometer. The reproducibility of the melting
    point was better than that of the freezing point by a factor of more than 2, regardless
    of the internal shape of the crucible. The freezing temperature gradually decreased
    with the degree of supercooling, and the slope was observed to be about −0.08
    °C. It was found that in terms of reproducibility and easiness of realization
    the melting point was better than the freezing point for use as a fixed temperature
    point. Therefore, it is proposed to use the melting point as a fixed point for
    thermocouple calibration. Regarding the difference in internal structure of the
    crucible, it was observed that a cell with circular grooves was slightly better
    in terms of reproducibility of melting and freezing points, but it was still unclear
    whether this was due to the grooves formed inside the cells, and, thus, additional
    research is needed. The average melting temperature and uncertainty of the Ni
    cells fabricated in this study was evaluated as (1454.1 ± 0.9) °C.</p>
