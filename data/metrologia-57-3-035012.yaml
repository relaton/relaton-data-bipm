abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We study whether the optical properties of a solid glass retroreflector
    influence the value of the acceleration of gravity g determined by dropping both
    solid and open retroreflectors in an absolute ballistic gravimeter. The retroreflectors
    have equivalent optical centers and are dropped from the same height, at a fixed
    location, in the same gravimeter while recording time data corresponding to fixed
    fringe separation intervals of 400 fringes. The data for both types of retroreflectors
    are processed with commercial software, as well as with independently developed
    software based on a relativistic treatment of the phase difference between reference
    beam and test beams, and a realistic treatment of the effect of frequency modulation,
    with modulation index \nβ≫1, on the interference signal. After applying corrections
    for polar motion, barometric admittance, tides, and ocean loading we find agreement
    between the values of g determined with both types of retroreflectors, whether
    processed with commercial software or with our independently developed software.
    We suggest two procedures for computing relativistic corrections; the two methods
    agree to better than 0.01 µGal.</p>"
