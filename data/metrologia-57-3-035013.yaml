abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Traceability of digital sensors is a metrological challenge,
    as well as a present priority, as stated within the emerging metrology requirements
    for the future in the Strategy 2017 to 2027 document of the Consultative Committee
    for Acoustics, Ultrasound, and Vibration of BIPM. From this perspective, in this
    paper, a calibration system for 3-axis digital MEMS accelerometers is described,
    in order to simultaneously evaluate the main and transverse sensitivities in the
    frequency domain (from 5 Hz up to 3 kHz) and in static conditions, together with
    a proper sensitivity parameter for digital outputs, thus providing the required
    metrological traceability. The procedure, based on the comparison to a reference
    transducer, involves a single-axis excitation of inclined planes. Experimental
    results are expressed in terms of exploitation and sensitivities matrices. Overall
    expanded uncertainties of the main terms are in the order of 2%, in dynamic conditions,
    and 1%–2% in static conditions. The feasibility of this system can be exploited
    for the development of manufacturers’ in-line control systems and for the investigation
    of large-scale calibration procedures.</p>
