    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A tabletop-sized Kibble balance (KIBB-g1) designed to directly realize mass at the gram-level range with uncertainties on the order of parts in 10<sup>6</sup> has been developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The masses of a nominally 5 g and 1 g weight were determined with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab507dieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> standard uncertainties of 9.0 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab507dieqn002.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>g and 6.7 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab507dieqn003.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>g, respectively. The corresponding relative uncertainties are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab507dieqn004.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab507dieqn005.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>. The construction of the instrument, capabilities, and full uncertainty budgets are presented in this manuscript.</p>
