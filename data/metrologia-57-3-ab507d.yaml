abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A tabletop-sized Kibble balance (KIBB-g1) designed to directly
    realize mass at the gram-level range with uncertainties on the order of parts
    in 10<sup>6</sup> has been developed at the National Institute of Standards and
    Technology (NIST). The masses of a nominally 5 g and 1 g weight were determined
    with  standard uncertainties of 9.0 g and 6.7 g, respectively. The corresponding
    relative uncertainties are  and. The construction of the instrument, capabilities,
    and full uncertainty budgets are presented in this manuscript.</p>
