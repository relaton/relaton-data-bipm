abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We report the results of measurements of the total hemispherical
    emissivity coefficients of the most popular vacuum compatible materials used in
    designs of optical atomic clocks. The experimental vacuum test chamber was designed
    to precisely quantify the heat transfer between the material’s samples and a calibrated
    plate that serves as a thermometer. The temperatures of vacuum chamber’s internal
    surfaces were measured and their heat balance equations were solved to designate
    their emissivities. The simplicity of the experimental set-up allows for analytical
    calculations of all necessary parameters without use of numerical finite elements
    methods (FEM). The reported results cover the temperature range between 0.0 and
    \n25.0∘C, that is crucial in optical clocks set-ups operating at room temperatures.
    The linear model of the emissivity change with the temperature is applied to the
    measured data to make them applicable in further calculations or FEM simulations.</p>"
