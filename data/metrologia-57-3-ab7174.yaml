abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Since the double-loop atom interferometer consisting of Raman
    \nπ2−π−π−π2 four-pulse sequences can eliminate the dependence of the interferometric
    phase shift on the atomic initial velocity, it is widely used for rotation measurements.
    However, our research shows that by coupling itself with both the atomic initial
    velocity and the laser detuning, the short pulse duration can contribute to unknown
    systematic errors within the current instrument sensitivity. The coupling of the
    pulse duration with the laser detuning inside the device is verified experimentally
    and presented in this work. An improved pulse sequence design is developed to
    eliminate these systematic errors and improve the precision of the rotation measurements.</p>"
