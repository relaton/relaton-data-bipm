abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The international reference system for radioactivity relies
    on stable instrumentation for comparing primary standards of radioactivity; these
    instruments enable national metrology institutes to demonstrate the equivalence
    of their primary standards. The international bureau of weights and measures (BIPM)
    holds two such instruments for gamma-ray emitting radionuclides, and is working
    with the POLATOM, LNE/LNHB, NIM, NPL and PTB to develop a new system called the
    ‘extended international reference system’ (ESIR). The ESIR will address pure beta-particle
    emitting radionuclides as well as other radionuclides (such as<sup>55</sup>Fe)
    which cannot be measured in the established international systems. The ESIR will
    be a liquid scintillation system based on three photon-counting channels operating
    in coincidence. This article reports the results from validation studies carried
    out using solutions of<sup>3</sup>H,<sup>55</sup>Fe,<sup>63</sup>Ni and<sup>14</sup>C
    to assess the reproducibility of the results. Several key comparison indicators
    have been developed and tested to find the best way to obtain a robust and reproducible
    international reference value. An important conclusion is that the new ESIR can
    deliver accurate comparison values, immune from changes in detection efficiency
    or asymmetry of the counting channels. A relative uncertainty better than 0.2%
    can be expected for radionuclides emitting beta particles with an end-point energy
    above 150 keV while using commercial liquid scintillation cocktails.</p>
