    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The subrange inconsistency (SRI) of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) arises from the use of different interpolating equations for the same standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs), called Type 1 non-uniqueness, and is a significant component of the uncertainty in the realization of the scale. In order to eliminate the SRI, new interpolating equations were proposed for the subranges 0.01 <sup>°</sup>C to 660.323 <sup>°</sup>C and 0.01 <sup>°</sup>C to 961.78 <sup>°</sup>C, in which the subrange to the zinc point (419.527 <sup>°</sup>C) was extended using two additional terms without any overlap. This study investigated 30 SPRTs calibrated over the temperature range of 0.01 <sup>°</sup>C–660.323 <sup>°</sup>C and 19 high-temperature SPRTs (HTSPRTs) calibrated over 0.01 <sup>°</sup>C–961.78 <sup>°</sup>C at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM). The feasibility of the proposed equations were evaluated by comparing them with the equations defined in ITS-90 and calculating the propagation uncertainties. The results show that the differences between the defined interpolating equations in ITS-90 and the proposed interpolating equations are generally within ± 0.4 mK for temperature range of 419.527 <sup>°</sup>C–961.78 <sup>°</sup>C, which is close to or less than the SRIs between the water-zinc and water-aluminium subranges. The propagated uncertainties of the proposed equations were within reasonable limits. It is concluded that these new interpolating equations can be taken as equivalent to the ITS-90 interpolating equations with the SRI eliminated.</p>
