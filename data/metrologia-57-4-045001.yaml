abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The subrange inconsistency (SRI) of the International Temperature
    Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) arises from the use of different interpolating equations
    for the same standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs), called Type 1
    non-uniqueness, and is a significant component of the uncertainty in the realization
    of the scale. In order to eliminate the SRI, new interpolating equations were
    proposed for the subranges 0.01<sup>°</sup>C to 660.323<sup>°</sup>C and 0.01<sup>°</sup>C
    to 961.78<sup>°</sup>C, in which the subrange to the zinc point (419.527<sup>°</sup>C)
    was extended using two additional terms without any overlap. This study investigated
    30 SPRTs calibrated over the temperature range of 0.01<sup>°</sup>C–660.323<sup>°</sup>C
    and 19 high-temperature SPRTs (HTSPRTs) calibrated over 0.01<sup>°</sup>C–961.78<sup>°</sup>C
    at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM). The feasibility of the proposed
    equations were evaluated by comparing them with the equations defined in ITS-90
    and calculating the propagation uncertainties. The results show that the differences
    between the defined interpolating equations in ITS-90 and the proposed interpolating
    equations are generally within ± 0.4 mK for temperature range of 419.527<sup>°</sup>C–961.78<sup>°</sup>C,
    which is close to or less than the SRIs between the water-zinc and water-aluminium
    subranges. The propagated uncertainties of the proposed equations were within
    reasonable limits. It is concluded that these new interpolating equations can
    be taken as equivalent to the ITS-90 interpolating equations with the SRI eliminated.</p>
