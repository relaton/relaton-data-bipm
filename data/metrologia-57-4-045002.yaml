    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This work reports on the upgrades made to the direct emissivity measurement facility of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). The instrumental improvements consist of, among others, a high-vacuum system and a wider temperature range (300 K to 1273 K). Methodological developments include a refined measurement equation with updated parameters and a reworked ISO-compliant uncertainty budget, and a Monte Carlo procedure for accurate calculations of total emissivities from spectral data. These upgrades have been demonstrated and validated in measurements of both metallic and ceramic materials. The results obtained in this work are applicable to similar experimental devices for emissivity measurements in order to report reliable emissivity data.</p>
