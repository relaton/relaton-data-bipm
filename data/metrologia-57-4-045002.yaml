abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This work reports on the upgrades made to the direct emissivity
    measurement facility of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). The instrumental
    improvements consist of, among others, a high-vacuum system and a wider temperature
    range (300 K to 1273 K). Methodological developments include a refined measurement
    equation with updated parameters and a reworked ISO-compliant uncertainty budget,
    and a Monte Carlo procedure for accurate calculations of total emissivities from
    spectral data. These upgrades have been demonstrated and validated in measurements
    of both metallic and ceramic materials. The results obtained in this work are
    applicable to similar experimental devices for emissivity measurements in order
    to report reliable emissivity data.</p>
