abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>When measuring the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function
    (BRDF) to characterize typical materials, the effect of the polarization of the
    light source or the dependence of the detector on the polarization is not usually
    considered, even though many studies have proven their impact in the uncertainty
    of the BRDF of most materials, including diffuse reflectance standards. A methodology
    to assess polarization-related effects proposed by other authors has been tested
    in this work for the measurement of the BRDF of four typical materials used for
    realizing white diffuse reflectance standards (ceramic tile, barium sulfate, Spectralon
    and Russian opal glass). Relative systematic error due to polarizing conditions
    is calculated as a combination of the instrument polarization bias and sample-based
    coefficients, and the impact of the proposed methodology on the uncertainty is
    discussed.</p>
