abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Accurate and reliable dynamic pressure measurements are needed
    for optimizing performance in modern combustion engines, manufacturing processes
    and aerospace applications. Besides fast pressure transients, these applications
    subject dynamic pressure transducers to elevated temperatures. Both of these quantities
    effect the sensitivity of transducers. Therefore, transducers should be calibrated
    at conditions that corresponds to the operating environment.</p><p>To answer these
    needs, the National Metrology Institute VTT MIKES has developed its drop weight
    dynamic pressure primary standard further. Developments include improved control
    and measurement of the falling weight, extension of the pressure range to combustion
    engine pressures down to 3 MPa and a heating option for dynamic pressure transducers
    under calibration. These advances enable traceable calibration of cylinder pressure
    transducers at conditions relevant to engine applications. The overall uncertainty
    (k = 2) of calibration is estimated to be around 1.7%. The performance was demonstrated
    by calibrating a piezoelectric pressure transducer in the pressure and temperature
    range from 7 MPa to 30 MPa in 20 °C, 120 °C and 180 °C, respectively. As a result,
    traceable calibrations of dynamic pressure transducers can be performed at conditions
    relevant for engine applications. This improves the reliability and accuracy of
    in-cylinder pressure measurements.</p>
