    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Non-uniqueness is a fundamental limit to the reproducibility of a defined temperature scale. In this paper, the non-uniqueness of temperatures, <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub>, on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) above the silver point is fully investigated for the first time. The non-uniqueness arises from three causes: inconsistency in extrapolation with the choice of the three allowable ITS-90 reference fixed points; a wavelength dependence of <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> due to the difference between thermodynamic temperature, <italic>T</italic>, and <italic>T</italic><sub>90</sub> at these reference fixed points; and a further wavelength dependence arising from the discrepancy between the value of the second radiation constant defined on ITS-90 and its value derived from fundamental constants. The non-uniqueness is quantified by deriving an exact expression for <italic>T − T</italic><sub>90</sub> above the silver point and calculating the differences in this expression as a function of reference fixed point and wavelength. In the worst case, the non-uniqueness is about 100 mK, and <italic>T − T</italic><sub>90</sub> is as much as 400 mK, at 3000 °C.</p>
