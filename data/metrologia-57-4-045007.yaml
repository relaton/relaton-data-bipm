abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Non-uniqueness is a fundamental limit to the reproducibility
    of a defined temperature scale. In this paper, the non-uniqueness of temperatures,
    T<sub>90</sub>, on the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) above
    the silver point is fully investigated for the first time. The non-uniqueness
    arises from three causes: inconsistency in extrapolation with the choice of the
    three allowable ITS-90 reference fixed points; a wavelength dependence of T<sub>90</sub>
    due to the difference between thermodynamic temperature, T, and T<sub>90</sub>
    at these reference fixed points; and a further wavelength dependence arising from
    the discrepancy between the value of the second radiation constant defined on
    ITS-90 and its value derived from fundamental constants. The non-uniqueness is
    quantified by deriving an exact expression for T − T<sub>90</sub> above the silver
    point and calculating the differences in this expression as a function of reference
    fixed point and wavelength. In the worst case, the non-uniqueness is about 100
    mK, and T − T<sub>90</sub> is as much as 400 mK, at 3000 °C.</p>'
