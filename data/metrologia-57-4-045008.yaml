abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We perform experimental quantum polarimetry using a heralded
    single photon to analyze the optical activity of linearly polarized light traversing
    a chiral medium. Three kinds of estimators are considered to estimate the concentrations
    of sucrose solutions from measuring the rotation angle of the linear polarization
    of the output photons. Through repetition of independent and identical measurements
    performed for each individual scheme and different concentration sucrose solutions,
    we compare the estimation uncertainty among the three schemes. The results are
    also compared to classical benchmarks for which a coherent state of light is taken
    into account. The quantum enhancement in the estimation uncertainty is evaluated
    and the impact of experimental and technical imperfections is discussed. In this
    work, we lay out a route for future applications relying on quantum polarimetry.</p>
