abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>After several years of development and continuous improvement
    of the BIPM Kibble balance, mass measurement of a 1 kg Pt/Ir artefact in terms
    of the Planck constant has been carried out. The paper describes the apparatus
    and its alignment, and explains the measurement and data processing. The balance
    operates in a one-mode and two measurement phase scheme using a bifilar coil.
    The mass value of the artefact was measured in vacuum with a relative standard
    uncertainty of 49 µg. This value differs from the value deduced from the calibration
    following the dissemination process after the redefinition of the kilogram by
    15 µg.</p>
