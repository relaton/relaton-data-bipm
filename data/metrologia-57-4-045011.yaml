abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The self-attraction effect (SAE) is an important systematic
    error in a high-precision atom interferometry gravimeter, which has been researched.
    In this paper, we use the finite element method (FEM) to calculate the SAE of
    an atom gravity gradiometer. In this way, the SAE of the gravity gradiometer is
    accurately determined, and the calculation result shows this effect is 235(8)
    E (1 E  =  1) in the atom gravity gradiometer. Based on this calculation, this
    effect in many high-precision experiments can be corrected.</p>
