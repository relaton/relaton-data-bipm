    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The self-attraction effect (SAE) is an important systematic error in a high-precision atom interferometry gravimeter, which has been researched. In this paper, we use the finite element method (FEM) to calculate the SAE of an atom gravity gradiometer. In this way, the SAE of the gravity gradiometer is accurately determined, and the calculation result shows this effect is 235(8) E (1 E  =  1<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="metab5830ieqn001.gif" xlink:type="simple"></inline-graphic></inline-formula>) in the atom gravity gradiometer. Based on this calculation, this effect in many high-precision experiments can be corrected.</p>
