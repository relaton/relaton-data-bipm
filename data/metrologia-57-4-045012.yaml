    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Nowadays, fast and precise density measurements of fluids are mostly performed using so-called oscillation-type density meters, able to measure in a very wide interval of temperature and pressure. This work aimed to developed, characterized and validated a high-pressure density measurement (HPDM) apparatus ensuring the traceability to SI of density measurements performed with these devices at high pressure (up to 650 bar) with a relative uncertainty of 8.0 × 10<sup>–4</sup>. The developed HPDM apparatus and methodology are found to be suitable to be used for calibration purposes, as recommended by the standard ASTM D7961, fulfilling this existing gap in density traceability chain.</p>
