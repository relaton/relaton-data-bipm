abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The joule balance is one of the mass traceability devices in
    the revised International System of Units, and its smooth operation relies on
    a compensation coil to reduce the effect of the external magnetic field. In this
    paper, the interaction between the magnetized coil-suspension system and the compensation
    coil is theoretically analyzed and experimentally verified. First, an additional
    induced voltage can be detected in the compensation coil when it moves relative
    to the magnetized coil-suspension system, which will lead to a measurement deviation
    of several parts in 10<sup>6</sup> in the moving phase. Second, if the excitation
    current also flows through the compensation coil in the weighing phase, then an
    additional magnetization force which can not be canceled out by the mass-on and
    mass-off measurements will be applied on the coil-suspension system. Theoretical
    analysis indicates that the deviations introduced in the two phases are nearly
    equivalent, so that the final mass measurement result will not be affected at
    least on the magnitude of 10<sup>−9</sup>. However, this conclusion can only be
    verified at 10<sup>−8</sup> level due to the current measurement limitations of
    the joule balance.</p>
