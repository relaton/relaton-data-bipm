abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The determination of the local acceleration of gravity at the
    mass position is an important aspect of the joule balance. Since a simultaneous
    measurement of the absolute gravity at the mass position with the joule balance
    in place is impossible, seven gravity reference sites are chosen in the joule
    balance laboratory. Absolute and relative gravity measurements at the reference
    sites were performed between 2015 and 2019, and varioust transfer methods were
    used to obtain an absolute gravity value at the mass position. The self-attraction
    effects of joule balance apparatus are corrected by FEA simulation, and calculation
    accuracy is also verified by experiment. To obtain real-time local gravitational
    acceleration values during the joule balance experiment, geophysical effects,
    such as atmospheric pressure, Earth tides, and polar motion are considered. The
    absolute gravity results exhibit good stability from 2015 to 2019, and the final
    gravitational uncertainty contribution in the joule balance is 6.1 Î¼Gal.</p>
