abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have investigated species-specific isotope dilution mass
    spectrometry (IDMS) for the quantification of ferritin-bound iron in murine serum
    and brain. Therefore, fresh samples were analyzed using size exclusion chromatography
    inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SEC-ICP-MS). Isotopically labeled
    (<sup>57</sup>Fe)ferritin was used as calibrant for the quantification of ferritin-bound
    iron in murine samples. Assessment of the iron load of serum ferritin was impaired
    by concomitant iron-containing proteins of similar size and shape, which could
    not be separated by SEC nor centrifugal ultra-filtration. In contrast, ferritin
    was the main iron-containing protein in cytosolic extracts of murine brain, which
    showed a total ferritin-bound iron content of (1.05 ± 0.12) µg g<sup>−1</sup>
    (n= 10; U, k= 2). The relative expanded uncertainty achieved for a mass fraction
    of ca. 1 µg g<sup>−1</sup> ferritin-bound iron was 11% (U<sub>rel</sub>, k = 2).
    The relative expanded uncertainty of the iron mass fraction of the (<sup>57</sup>Fe)ferritin
    spike was 5.7% and represented the major contributing factor to the overall uncertainty.
    Statistical tests suggested no significant difference in ferritin-bound iron content
    between mouse brain hemispheres. The presented analytical tool provides low limits
    of quantification (2.2 ng g<sup>−1</sup>) and uncertainties (11%, U<sub>rel</sub>,
    k = 2), thus enables the quantification of ferritin-bound iron in murine brain
    extracts with high sensitivity and accuracy. Furthermore, this analytical workflow
    assures comparability of measurement results across research laboratories. This
    provides the basis for investigation of the iron loading of ferritin in brain
    tissue of healthy and Alzheimer’s disease mouse models, which may help answering
    the question if iron regulation is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
