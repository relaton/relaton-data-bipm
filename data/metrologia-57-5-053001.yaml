    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Some recent papers have argued that frequency should have the dimensions of angle/time, with the consequences that 1 Hz = 2π rad s<sup>−1</sup> instead of 1 s<sup>−1</sup>, and also that <italic>ν</italic> = <italic>ω</italic> and <italic>h</italic> = <italic>ħ</italic>. This letter puts the case that this argument redefines the quantity ‘frequency’ and then draws conclusions from equations that rely on the standard definition being used. The problems that this redefinition is designed to address arise from the widespread unstated adoption of the Radian Convention, which treats the radian as a dimensionless quantity equal to the number 1, in effect making the radian a ‘hidden’ unit. This convention is currently ‘built-in’ to the SI, when it should be separable from it. The unhelpful status of angles in the SI can be remedied with minimal disruption by (1) changing the definition of the radian from ‘a radian equals 1 m m<sup>−1</sup>’ to e.g. ‘a right angle equals π/2 radians’, and (2) acknowledging that the adoption of the Radian Convention is acceptable, when made explicit. The standard definitions of ‘frequency’ and the hertz should remain unchanged.</p>
