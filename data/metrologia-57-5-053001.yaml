abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Some recent papers have argued that frequency should have the
    dimensions of angle/time, with the consequences that 1 Hz = 2π rad s<sup>−1</sup>
    instead of 1 s<sup>−1</sup>, and also that ν = ω and h = ħ. This letter puts the
    case that this argument redefines the quantity ‘frequency’ and then draws conclusions
    from equations that rely on the standard definition being used. The problems that
    this redefinition is designed to address arise from the widespread unstated adoption
    of the Radian Convention, which treats the radian as a dimensionless quantity
    equal to the number 1, in effect making the radian a ‘hidden’ unit. This convention
    is currently ‘built-in’ to the SI, when it should be separable from it. The unhelpful
    status of angles in the SI can be remedied with minimal disruption by (1) changing
    the definition of the radian from ‘a radian equals 1 m m<sup>−1</sup>’ to e.g.
    ‘a right angle equals π/2 radians’, and (2) acknowledging that the adoption of
    the Radian Convention is acceptable, when made explicit. The standard definitions
    of ‘frequency’ and the hertz should remain unchanged.</p>
