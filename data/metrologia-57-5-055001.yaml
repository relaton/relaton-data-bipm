abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The traceability of measurements of the parameters characterizing
    single-photon sources, such as photon flux and optical power, paves the way towards
    their reliable comparison and quantitative evaluation. In this paper, we present
    an absolute measurement of the optical power of a single-photon source based on
    an InGaAs quantum dot under pulsed excitation with a calibrated single-photon
    avalanche diode (SPAD) detector. For this purpose, a single excitonic line of
    the quantum dot emission with a bandwidth below 0.1 nm was spectrally filtered
    by using two tilted interference filters. Since high count rates are essential
    for many metrological applications, we optimized the setup efficiency by combining
    high overall transmission of the optical components with a geometrical enhancement
    of the extraction efficiency of a single quantum dot by a monolithic microlens
    to reach photon fluxes up to \n\n3.7⋅105 photons per second at the SPADs. A relative
    calibration of two SPAD detectors with a relative standard uncertainty of 0.7%
    was carried out and verified by the standard calibration method using an attenuated
    laser. Finally, an Allan deviation analysis was performed giving an optimal averaging
    time of 92 s for the photon flux.</p>"
