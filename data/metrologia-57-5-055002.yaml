abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The precise measurements of absolute high, especially super-high
    reflectances (R &gt; 99.999%) of highly reflective mirrors with cavity ring-down
    (CRD) technique is challenging due to lack of ‘known’ calibration samples and
    eligible and effective cross-validation method. In this paper, measurement precision
    of super-high reflectance is greatly improved via filtering out the random optical
    loss fluctuation caused by large particle intervention in the beam path inside
    the open-path ring-down cavity. The absolute measurement of super-high reflectance
    is realized through cross-checking the reflectance results measured with fixed
    cavity length as well as variable cavity length CRDs together with linear and
    non-linear data processing approaches. With an open-path CRD experimental setup,
    the absolute reflectance of a highly reflective mirror for laser gyroscope is
    determined to be 99.99956% with an uncertainty of only approximately 0.2ppm.</p>
