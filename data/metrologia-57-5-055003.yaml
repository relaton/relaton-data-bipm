abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>New measurements of thermodynamic temperature T with Dielectric-Constant
    Gas Thermometry (DCGT) were performed at PTB from 50 K to 200 K. Particular care
    was taken to check for possible systematic sources of errors by performing experiments
    applying three working gases, namely helium, neon, and argon, the polarizability
    of which differs by a factor of up to eight. Together with former DCGT values
    of thermodynamic temperature the new results yield a consistent dataset in the
    range from 30 K to 200 K. This dataset is in good agreement with the newest results
    of Acoustic Gas Thermometry (AGT) and Refractive-Index Gas Thermometry (RIGT),
    which have quite different sources of uncertainty compared with DCGT. The combination
    of these DCGT, AGT, and RIGT data with the ‘Estimates of the differences between
    thermodynamic temperature and the ITS-90’, being as an appendix of the ‘Mise en
    pratique for the definition of the kelvin in the SI’ the present-day recommendation
    of the Consultative Committee for Thermometry, yields a new function T − T<sub>90</sub>
    versus ITS-90 temperature T<sub>90</sub> for the range from 35 K to 195 K, the
    uncertainty of which is reduced by a factor up to about four.</p>
