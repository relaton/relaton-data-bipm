- content: Abstract<p>The characteristics of an optimized sampling system for measurements
    of isotope ratios in pure CO<sub>2</sub> gas with Isotope Ratio Infrared Spectroscopy
    measurement systems that has achieved reproducible measurement of δ<sup>13</sup>
    C and δ<sup>18</sup>O values with 0.02‰ reproducibility (1 σ) is described. The
    key elements of the sampling system revolve around almost identical treatment
    of sample and reference gases allowing two-point calibration of up to 14 samples,
    and appropriate flushing protocols to remove any biases from memory effects of
    previously sampled gases. Measurements are performed by the Isotope Ratio Infrared
    Spectroscopy system at a mole fraction of nominally 700 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>
    CO<sub>2</sub> in air, by dilution of pure CO<sub>2</sub> gas controlled by individual
    low-flow mass flow controllers (0.07 ml min<sup>−1</sup>), and with a feedback
    loop to control mole fractions to ensure that differences between references and
    sample gas mole fraction stay below 2 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. This level of control
    is necessary to prevent biases in measured isotope ratios, the magnitude of which
    has also been studied with a sensitivity study. The system has been validated
    using pure CO<sub>2</sub> samples which range in δ<sup>13</sup> C delta values
    of −1‰ and −45‰ vs VPDB-CO<sub>2</sub>, and in all cases measurement reproducibility
    over several days of testing of 0.02‰ or better (1 σ) was achieved for both δ<sup>13</sup>
    C and δ<sup>18</sup>O, with negligible memory effects. The amount of sample gas
    used for each measurement was less than 5 ml of CO<sub>2</sub> at (RTP), making
    the system easily deployable for isotope ratio value assignment of bulk CO<sub>2</sub>
    gas, and adaptable to atmospheric mole fractions of CO<sub>2</sub> in air, and
    for value assignments of standards. Using the sampling system described the measurement
    reproducibility of current Isotope Ratio Infrared Spectroscopy systems approaches
    measurement reproducibility that can be achieved with some IRMS systems.</p>
