    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The characteristics of an optimized sampling system for measurements of isotope ratios in pure CO<sub>2</sub> gas with Isotope Ratio Infrared Spectroscopy measurement systems that has achieved reproducible measurement of <italic>δ</italic><sup>13</sup> C and <italic>δ</italic><sup>18</sup>O values with 0.02‰ reproducibility (1 σ) is described. The key elements of the sampling system revolve around almost identical treatment of sample and reference gases allowing two-point calibration of up to 14 samples, and appropriate flushing protocols to remove any biases from memory effects of previously sampled gases. Measurements are performed by the Isotope Ratio Infrared Spectroscopy system at a mole fraction of nominally 700 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> CO<sub>2</sub> in air, by dilution of pure CO<sub>2</sub> gas controlled by individual low-flow mass flow controllers (0.07 ml min<sup>−1</sup>), and with a feedback loop to control mole fractions to ensure that differences between references and sample gas mole fraction stay below 2 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. This level of control is necessary to prevent biases in measured isotope ratios, the magnitude of which has also been studied with a sensitivity study. The system has been validated using pure CO<sub>2</sub> samples which range in <italic>δ</italic><sup>13</sup> C delta values of −1‰ and −45‰ vs VPDB-CO<sub>2</sub>, and in all cases measurement reproducibility over several days of testing of 0.02‰ or better (1 σ) was achieved for both <italic>δ</italic><sup>13</sup> C and <italic>δ</italic><sup>18</sup>O, with negligible memory effects. The amount of sample gas used for each measurement was less than 5 ml of CO<sub>2</sub> at (RTP), making the system easily deployable for isotope ratio value assignment of bulk CO<sub>2</sub> gas, and adaptable to atmospheric mole fractions of CO<sub>2</sub> in air, and for value assignments of standards. Using the sampling system described the measurement reproducibility of current Isotope Ratio Infrared Spectroscopy systems approaches measurement reproducibility that can be achieved with some IRMS systems.</p>
