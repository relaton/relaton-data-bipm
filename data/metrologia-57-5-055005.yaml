  content: "<title>Abstract</title> <p>The flight model of the laser-cooled cesium
    atomic clock, PHARAO, has been qualified for operation in space. The clock has
    passed the vibration, thermal and electromagnetic compatibility tests required
    to fly in low Earth orbit (400 km). On the ground, the clock realized a typical
    frequency stability of 3.0 × 10<sup>−13</sup> τ<sup>−1/2</sup> with an estimated
    accuracy of 2.3 × 10<sup>−15</sup>. Frequency comparisons with the SYRTE primary
    frequency standard FOM agree within their stated accuracies. Because PHARAO is
    optimized for the longer interaction times possible in microgravity, we expect
    a frequency stability of 1.1 × 10<sup>−13</sup> τ <sup>−1/2</sup> and a frequency
    accuracy of 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for operation in space. The clock has been
    delivered to the European Space Agency for the assembly of the ACES payload and
    is scheduled to be launched into space in 2021.</p>"
