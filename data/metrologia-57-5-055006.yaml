abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the revised international system of units (SI), the kilogram
    is realized through methods linking mass to the Planck constant such as the Kibble
    balance experiment and x-ray crystal density method. We report on the first experiment
    for kilogram realization at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science
    (KRISS). The masses of two artefacts (platinum–iridium and stainless steel) were
    measured using the KRISS Kibble balance between December 2019 and January 2020
    at a pressure between 3 × 10<sup>–3</sup> Pa and 4 × 10<sup>–3</sup> Pa. The relative
    standard uncertainty of the realization experiment was 1.2 × 10<sup>–7</sup>.
    The mass of the platinum–iridium artefact (No. 111) determined by the KRISS Kibble
    balance experiment was 2 µg different from the mass determined by historical traceability
    to the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK) in the previous SI. For the
    stainless steel artefact, the difference in mass value determined by the KRISS
    Kibble balance and historical traceability was 56 µg.</p>
