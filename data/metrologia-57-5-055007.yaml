    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In 2017, we published the first measurement result with the NIM-2 joule balance and the relative standard uncertainty was 2.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>. Since then, a series of improvements have been carried out to upgrade the NIM-2 joule balance towards the 10<sup>–8</sup> level relative uncertainty. The main improvements include a permanent magnet, as well as a two-layer magnetic shield to decrease the main uncertainty contribution from the external magnetic field, a parasitic displacement measurement system and a new suspension for improving alignments, and a new mass translation stage constructed with all non-magnetic materials. In September 2019, when the NIM-2 joule balance was used to calibrate a 1 kg mass, the type A relative standard uncertainty had been reduced to 3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>(<italic>k</italic>= 1) and the combined relative standard uncertainty was less than 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>(<italic>k</italic>= 1). In October and November 2019, a 1 kg Pt/Ir mass and a 1 kg stainless steel mass were measured with the NIM-2 joule balance, and the relative standard uncertainties were 5.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and 6.5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, respectively. The relative difference between the measured values and the calibration values obtained from the mass group were 4 × 10<sup>−9</sup> and 3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, respectively.</p>
