abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In 2017, we published the first measurement result with the
    NIM-2 joule balance and the relative standard uncertainty was 2.4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>.
    Since then, a series of improvements have been carried out to upgrade the NIM-2
    joule balance towards the 10<sup>–8</sup> level relative uncertainty. The main
    improvements include a permanent magnet, as well as a two-layer magnetic shield
    to decrease the main uncertainty contribution from the external magnetic field,
    a parasitic displacement measurement system and a new suspension for improving
    alignments, and a new mass translation stage constructed with all non-magnetic
    materials. In September 2019, when the NIM-2 joule balance was used to calibrate
    a 1 kg mass, the type A relative standard uncertainty had been reduced to 3 ×
    10<sup>−8</sup>(k= 1) and the combined relative standard uncertainty was less
    than 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>(k= 1). In October and November 2019, a 1 kg Pt/Ir mass
    and a 1 kg stainless steel mass were measured with the NIM-2 joule balance, and
    the relative standard uncertainties were 5.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup> and 6.5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>,
    respectively. The relative difference between the measured values and the calibration
    values obtained from the mass group were 4 × 10<sup>−9</sup> and 3 × 10<sup>−8</sup>,
    respectively.</p>
