abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This article deals with the erratic and inconsistent phase-noise
    spectra often seen in low-noise oscillators, whose floor is of the order of âˆ’180
    dBc/Hz or less. Such oscillators are generally measured with two-channel instruments
    based on averaging two simultaneous and statistically independent measures. Our
    new method consists of inserting a dissipative attenuator between the oscillator
    under test and the phase-noise analyzer. The thermal noise of the attenuator introduces
    a controlled amount of phase noise. We compare the phase noise floor to the theoretical
    expectation with different values of the attenuation in small steps. The analysis
    reveals a negative bias (underestimation of phase noise) due to the thermal energy
    of the internal power splitter at the instrument input, and an uncertainty due
    to crosstalk between the two channels. In not-so-rare unfortunate cases, the bias
    results in a negative phase-noise spectrum, which is an obvious nonsense. Similar
    results are observed separately in three labs with instruments from the two major
    brands. We provide experimental evidence, full theory and suggestions to mitigate
    the problem, and a first attempt to assess the uncertainty. Our multiple-attenuators
    method provides quantitative information about the correlation phenomena inside
    the instrument.</p>
