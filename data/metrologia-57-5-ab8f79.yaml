abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In conventional shock tubes with a diaphragm, many effects related
    to the burst of the diaphragm can influence shock formation, thus preventing an
    ideal pressure step change, as predicted by the shock tube measurement model being
    generated. This paper presents a newly developed diaphragmless shock tube with
    a quick-acting pneumatic valve, which demonstrates several advantages over conventional
    shock tubes with a diaphragm. The tests of the developed diaphragmless shock tube
    were performed using nitrogen at the atmospheric initial driven pressure, and
    at initial driver gauge pressures from 1 MPa to 7 MPa. The results show that the
    construction of the developed shock tube effectively reduces the generation of
    secondary shock waves and mechanical vibrations, which are often generated during
    the operation of shock tubes, thereby increasing the uncertainty of the shock
    tube calibration method. The uncertainty analysis shows that the developed diphragmless
    shock tube can act as a primary time-varying pressure calibration standard, generating
    pressure steps with a magnitude calculable from its measurement model to characterize
    the dynamic performance of pressure transducers with a relative expanded uncertainty
    of less than 0.025.</p>
