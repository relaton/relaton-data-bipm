abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The established calibration of the transresistance of the ultrastable
    low-noise current amplifier (ULCA) directly involves a cryogenic current comparator
    (CCC). Here, we present an alternative approach based on a calibrated set of three
    resistors and three digital voltmeters. This approach was experimentally verified
    for a two-channel ULCA with nominally 1 GΩ transresistance using PTB’s travelling
    12 bit CCC setup in an on-site comparison at METAS. Series of interleaved experiments
    included calibrations of the input and output stages of two different ULCA channels.
    The consistency found between the conventional calibration with PTB’s CCC and
    calibration with METAS’ set of three resistors—each traced to the quantum Hall
    resistance with METAS’ CCC—confirms that the alternative traceability chain provides
    valuable results. If the standard resistors are calibrated without using a CCC,
    the new method even opens the possibility to calibrate the ULCA without any CCC
    in the traceability chain involved, however, typically at the expense of increased
    uncertainty.</p>
