abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The 2019 update to the Mise en Pratique for the metre adopted
    the lattice parameter of silicon as a secondary realisation of the metre for dimensional
    nanometrology. One route for this realisation is the use of amphitheatre like
    monoatomic steps of silicon. In response, in this paper we present new algorithms
    for one- and two-dimensional analysis of atomic force microscope images of these
    large area atomic terraces on the surface of silicon. These algorithms can be
    used to determine the spacing between the steps and identify errors in AFM scanning
    systems. Since the vertical separation of the steps is of the same order of magnitude
    as many errors associated with AFMs great care is needed in processing AFM measurements
    of the steps. However, using the algorithms presented in this paper, corrections
    may be made for AFM scanner bow and waviness as well as taking into account the
    edge effects on the silicon steps. Applicability of the data processing methods
    is demonstrated on data sets obtained from various instruments. Aspects of steps
    arrangement on surface and its impact on uncertainties are discussed as well.</p>
