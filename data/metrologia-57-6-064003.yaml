    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Chemical measurement laboratories that provide a broad range of services rely on efficient and rigorously validated measurement procedures to meet industry demands. The success of these laboratories ultimately hinges upon their ability to produce results that are both fit-for-purpose and affordable. Skillful planning of measurement experiments must therefore provide adequate confidence in results without being overly complex. A statistical procedure is presented that can be used by laboratories to optimize such experiment designs. Inputs to the statistical model are based upon simple criteria such as the number of available samples, expected variabilty of calibration data, and the largest acceptable uncertainty in the result. The outputs of the model guide a measurement scheme that can provide results with as small an uncertainty as possible under specified constraints, such as the desired range of calibration and the number of samples and repeated measurements that should be made. The method and software used to execute this model are demonstrated for planning evaluations of vitamin D in serum that inform clinical medicine diagnostics.</p>
