abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The mole was the final base unit to be included in the International
    System of Units. This article explores: our understanding of the mole and its
    characteristics; its relationship with the base quantity, amount of substance,
    of which it is the base unit; and when alternative ways of expressing measurement
    results would be preferable. Importantly, since the SI is a practical system,
    this article also develops an understanding of when the concept of the mole is
    useful and meaningful. An important outcome is that the mole must consider elementary
    entities located in close enough vicinity such that they could, in theory, react
    or interact with each other stoichiometrically. Further, it is observed that the
    majority of practical uses of the mole relate to describing the composition of
    mixtures where, unusually, the concept of a mole of dissimilar elementary entities
    is often advantageous. It is also noted that where ratio and fractions are used
    it is essential to display the measurement units being used in full to clarify
    what quantities are being expressed.</p>'
