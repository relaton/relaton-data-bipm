abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Distributed cavity phase (DCP) frequency shifts are a leading
    systematic effect in atomic fountain frequency standards. They originate from
    the phase variations of the field in the microwave cavity combined with different
    positions of the atoms in the cavity on the ascent and descent. Here we demonstrate
    techniques to precisely determine the position of the cloud of atoms in the microwave
    cavity, using either the approximately linear variation of the transverse components
    of the microwave field or the quadratic variation of the longitudinal microwave
    field amplitude in the cavity. We also show that shifting the initial position
    of the atoms gives a significantly higher sensitivity to DCP variations than the
    often-used tilting of fountains. A demonstrated centring precision of order 50
    μm will enable DCP frequency shift uncertainties to be reduced to less than 10<sup>–17</sup>
    and thereby contribute insignificantly to the accuracy budget of a standard. These
    techniques to vertically align a fountain are straightforward to automate for
    routine operation and require a negligible fraction of the standard’s averaging
    time.</p>
