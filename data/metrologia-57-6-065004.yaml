abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The quantum Fisher information (QFI) plays a key role in quantum
    metrological scenarios, and can be enhanced by certain entanglement protocols.
    In this work, we focus on the maximal mean QFI for L qubits, and study how a dynamical
    decoupling scheme rescues the entanglement-assisted QFI, which would be rapidly
    damaged by decoherence without such a scheme. We found that the square-wave modulation
    for the transition frequency of the qubit can be settled in a recursive transfer
    matrix form thus both periodic and random pulse sequences can be investigated
    exactly by assuming that the spectral density of the reservoir is Lorentzian.
    Considering the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state as an initial state of L qubits
    imbedded in the independent damping channels, the use of additional square-wave
    pulse sequences allows the Heisenberg scaling to be restored for parameterestimation
    precision. How to optimize the pulse parameters with certain pulse energies should
    be carefully treated. The analyzability of the modulated damping dynamics may
    provide a potential start point for defeating decoherence in quantum information
    processing.</p>
