  content: "<title>Abstract</title> <p>Several correction factors for two new reference
    beta-particle radiation fields complementing ISO 6980 have been measured and calculated
    for both primary beta dosimetry and the operational quantities in radiation protection.
    The following correction factors for primary beta dosimetry for the determination
    of the absorbed dose to tissue, <italic>D</italic><sub>t</sub>, have been determined
    by calculations: <italic>k</italic><sub>ba</sub> for backscatter from the collecting
    electrode, <italic>k</italic><sub>pe</sub> for perturbation by the chamber’s side
    walls, <italic>k</italic><sub>ih</sub> for inhomogeneity inside the collecting
    volume, <italic>k</italic><sub>Sta</sub> for the stopping power ratio at different
    phantom depths, and <italic>k</italic><sub>SA</sub> for the use of the Spencer-Attix
    theory, while the following have been measured: <italic>k</italic><sub>br</sub>
    for the effect of bremsstrahlung and <italic>k</italic><sub>abs</sub> for variations
    in the attenuation and scattering of beta particles between the source and the
    collecting volume due to variations from reference conditions and for differences
    of the entrance window to a tissue-equivalent thickness of 0.07 mm. Furthermore,
    calculations were undertaken to determine the following correction factors to
    assess the operational quantities <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(0.07), <italic>H</italic><sub>p</sub>(3),
    <italic>H′</italic>(0.07), and <italic>H′</italic>(3): <italic>k</italic><sub>rod</sub>(0.07)
    for the rod instead of the slab phantom, <italic>k</italic><sub>cyl</sub>(3) for
    the cylinder instead of the slab phantom, as well as <italic>k′</italic>(0.07)
    and <italic>k′</italic>(3) for the ICRU sphere instead of the slab phantom, while
    the correction factor for oblique radiation incidence has been measured. The newly
    determined correction factors were determined in the same way as those for several
    well-established beta-particle radiation fields described in two earlier publications
    by the author. Furthermore, they are ready to be implemented in an updated version
    of the ISO 6980 series and in the software of the Beta Secondary Standard BSS
