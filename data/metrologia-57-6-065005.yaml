abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Several correction factors for two new reference beta-particle
    radiation fields complementing ISO 6980 have been measured and calculated for
    both primary beta dosimetry and the operational quantities in radiation protection.
    The following correction factors for primary beta dosimetry for the determination
    of the absorbed dose to tissue, D<sub>t</sub>, have been determined by calculations:
    k<sub>ba</sub> for backscatter from the collecting electrode, k<sub>pe</sub> for
    perturbation by the chamber’s side walls, k<sub>ih</sub> for inhomogeneity inside
    the collecting volume, k<sub>Sta</sub> for the stopping power ratio at different
    phantom depths, and k<sub>SA</sub> for the use of the Spencer-Attix theory, while
    the following have been measured: k<sub>br</sub> for the effect of bremsstrahlung
    and k<sub>abs</sub> for variations in the attenuation and scattering of beta particles
    between the source and the collecting volume due to variations from reference
    conditions and for differences of the entrance window to a tissue-equivalent thickness
    of 0.07 mm. Furthermore, calculations were undertaken to determine the following
    correction factors to assess the operational quantities H<sub>p</sub>(0.07), H<sub>p</sub>(3),
    H′(0.07), and H′(3): k<sub>rod</sub>(0.07) for the rod instead of the slab phantom,
    k<sub>cyl</sub>(3) for the cylinder instead of the slab phantom, as well as k′(0.07)
    and k′(3) for the ICRU sphere instead of the slab phantom, while the correction
    factor for oblique radiation incidence has been measured. The newly determined
    correction factors were determined in the same way as those for several well-established
    beta-particle radiation fields described in two earlier publications by the author.
    Furthermore, they are ready to be implemented in an updated version of the ISO
    6980 series and in the software of the Beta Secondary Standard BSS 2.</p>'
