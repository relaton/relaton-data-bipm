abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We describe measurements of thermodynamic temperature in the
    range 5 K to 24.5561 K (the triple point of neon) using single-pressure refractive-index
    gas thermometry (SPRIGT) with<sup>4</sup>He. In the wake of the May 2019 re-definition
    of the kelvin and its associated mise en pratique, the main purpose of the work
    is to provide values of T–T<sub>90</sub>, the discrepancy between thermodynamic
    temperature and that of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90).
    The link to ITS-90 is made via calibrated rhodium-iron resistance thermometers.
    Innovations required to reach the level of accuracy required for meaningful measurements
    (uncertainty in T–T<sub>90</sub> less than the expected deviation) include the
    suppression of temperature oscillations in a cryogen-free cryostat, a pressure
    stabilization scheme based on a non-rotating piston balance, modelling of the
    hydrostatic head correction and refinements of the measurement of microwave resonances
    in a quasi-spherical copper resonator. The accuracy of measurements varies from
    0.05 mK to 0.17 mK and is competitive with that of all previous ones in this temperature
    range using other techniques. The improvement stems partly from the new techniques
    used for the new definition of the kelvin as well as ab initio calculations of
    the thermophysical properties ofgaseous<sup>4</sup>He. In addition to confirming
    the validity of SPRIGT as an accurate, easier-to-implement alternative to other
    low-temperature primary thermometry techniques (e.g. acoustic gas thermometry)
    yet with scope for improvement, the results should provide important input data
    for any future revision of ITS-90.</p>
