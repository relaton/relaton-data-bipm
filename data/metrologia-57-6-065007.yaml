abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In electrical metrology, voltage is a key quantity together
    with resistance for realising all electric standards in the low-frequency range.
    Zener voltage standards are accepted as the most stable to disseminate voltage
    references traceable to the Josephson standard devices. We study the long-term
    drift of the Zener devices to propose their initial calibration interval (CI),
    statistically analysing the calibration records accumulated for 15 years at the
    Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). First, we apply the
    direct method where the measurement reliability is obtained by integrating the
    probability density functions acquired from kernel density estimation (KDE). Markov
    chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been successfully demonstrated to determine the parameters
    of the Weibull reliability model. A numerical experiment was performed to confirm
    that the MCMC method works properly and is able to replace the S3 method of NCSLI.
    The direct method agrees with the MCMC within the highest posterior density (HPD)
    obtained by the MCMC method. The KDEs of the parameters acquired by the MCMC method
    enable the uncertainty of the parameters to be expressed in probability distributions
    rather than in confidence intervals. The final result proposes an initial CI of
    the 10 V output taps in the Zener devices without any calibration record of 8.8
    months with a 0.91-month standard deviation for 90% of the measurement reliability
    target (MRT) and a 16 Î¼V tolerance limit.</p>
