abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Monte Carlo method is an established tool that is often
    used to evaluate the uncertainty of measurements. For computationally challenging
    problems, Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses are typically distributed across multiple
    processes on a multi-node cluster or supercomputer. Additionally, results from
    previous uncertainty analyses are often used in further analyses in a sequential
    manner. To accurately capture the uncertainty of the output quantity of interest,
    Monte Carlo sample distributions must be treated consistently, using reproducible
    replicates, throughout the entire analysis. We highlight the need for and importance
    of consistent Monte Carlo methods in distributed and sequential uncertainty analyses,
    recommend an implementation to achieve the needed consistency in these complicated
    analyses, and discuss methods to evaluate the accuracy of implementations.</p>
