abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>It is important to realize a stand-alone timescale with high-quality
    stability in short- and long-terms that can function accurately without any external
    inputs. A free-running timescale (FreeAT) was calculated as a weighted average
    of five active hydrogen masers and has operated freely for more than 400 d in
    the Beijing Satellite Navigation Center (BSNC). In the weighted average algorithm,
    a cesium fountain clock (CsF1) with a typical Type-A uncertainty of 4.50 × 10<sup>−16</sup>
    for averaging times of 30 d was used as the frequency reference to estimate the
    frequency drifts of hydrogen masers. Additionally, the time difference between
    the rapid realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTCr) and FreeAT was obtained
    indirectly by utilizing the timescale signal comparison between the BSNC and National
    Institute of Metrology via an optical fiber link. The overlapping Allan deviation
    of FreeAT with respect to UTCr is 8.69 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for averaging times
    of 15 d, and its frequency difference and drift relative to UTCr are −1.20 × 10<sup>−16</sup>
    and −2.08E-18/day, respectively. Therefore, the combination of a fountain and
    maser ensemble can generate a high-performance time scale.</p>
