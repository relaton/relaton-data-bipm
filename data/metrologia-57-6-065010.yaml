abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)
    has led to a harmonization of uncertainty evaluation throughout metrology. The
    simplicity of its employed methodology has fostered the broad acceptance of the
    GUM among metrologists. However, this simplicity also compromises best practice
    and does not provide state-of-the-art data analysis. Specifically, metrologists
    often possess useful prior knowledge about the measurand which cannot be accounted
    for by the GUM. Bayesian uncertainty evaluation, on the other hand, takes prior
    knowledge about the measurand as its starting point. While this technique has
    been successfully applied in several instances in metrology, its broad access
    for metrologists is still lacking. One reason for this is that application of
    Bayesian methods and their computation, e.g. by means of Markov chain Monte Carlo
    (MCMC) methods, usually requires statistical skills.</p><p>In this work, we propose
    a simple method for Bayesian uncertainty evaluation applicable to measurement
    models that depend linearly on a single input quantity for which Type A information
    is available, and several input quantities for which Type B information is given.
    This category of measurement models covers many uncertainty evaluations in metrology.
    The approach utilizes a specific class of prior distributions to encode the prior
    information about the measurand. Explicit guidance is provided on how to choose
    the parameters of the prior in the light of one’s prior knowledge. MCMC methods
    are not required for the calculation of results; instead, a simple Monte Carlo
    procedure is developed that allows to draw uncorrelated samples from the posterior
    distribution, which greatly simplifies convergence assessments. The proposed Bayesian
    approach allows the treatment of small numbers of observations for a Type A uncertainty
    evaluation, including the case of only a single observation. Examples are provided
    that illustrate the proposed approach and corresponding open source Python software
    is made available.</p>
