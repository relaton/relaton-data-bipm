- script: Latn
  content: "\n<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>In this paper a new algorithm for the introduction
    of redundant time links in UTC calculation is presented. This algorithm is first
    applied for the evaluation of the uncertainty of [UTC-UTC(<italic>k</italic>)]
    reported in section 1 of <italic>Circular T</italic>. We show that it solves several
    limitations of the current method used to evaluate the uncertainties. In particular
    it facilitates the introduction of correlations, it allows increasing the calibration
    uncertainty assigned to uncalibrated laboratories without affecting the other
    laboratories, and obtaining a more realistic value for the uncertainty of [UTC-UTC(<italic>k</italic>)]
    for the present pivot (PTB). The next steps of the project concerning the use
    of redundant time links in UTC are also discussed.</p> "
