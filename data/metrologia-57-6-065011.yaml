abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper a new algorithm for the introduction of redundant
    time links in UTC calculation is presented. This algorithm is first applied for
    the evaluation of the uncertainty of [UTC-UTC(k)] reported in section 1 of Circular
    T. We show that it solves several limitations of the current method used to evaluate
    the uncertainties. In particular it facilitates the introduction of correlations,
    it allows increasing the calibration uncertainty assigned to uncalibrated laboratories
    without affecting the other laboratories, and obtaining a more realistic value
    for the uncertainty of [UTC-UTC(k)] for the present pivot (PTB). The next steps
    of the project concerning the use of redundant time links in UTC are also discussed.</p>
