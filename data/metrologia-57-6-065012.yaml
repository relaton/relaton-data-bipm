abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Algorithms to compute the statistical and systematic uncertainties
    in the difference between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and individual laboratory
    UTC realizations were published in several different, but equivalent, forms the
    early twenty-first century, at a time when the UTC algorithm was based on a minimal
    network. In this paper we extend the theory to compute the uncertainties in a
    manner entirely consistent with the earlier work, but which enables application
    to UTC computations employing redundant links, and correlated calibrations.</p>
