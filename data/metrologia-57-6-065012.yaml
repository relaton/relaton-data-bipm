  content: "<title>Abstract</title> <p>Algorithms to compute the statistical and systematic
    uncertainties in the difference between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and individual
    laboratory UTC realizations were published in several different, but equivalent,
    forms the early twenty-first century, at a time when the UTC algorithm was based
    on a minimal network. In this paper we extend the theory to compute the uncertainties
    in a manner entirely consistent with the earlier work, but which enables application
    to UTC computations employing redundant links, and correlated calibrations.</p>"
