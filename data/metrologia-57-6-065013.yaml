abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA) is
    expanding its capabilities in the field of the analysis of trace and ultra-trace
    levels of toxic and minor elements in environmental samples, with a special focus
    on soils to support projects of the University of Pretoria (UP) in the field of
    veterinary geology for the One Health Platform. The most accurate calibration
    strategy developed by the laboratory involves double isotope dilution analysis,
    where a stable isotope standard of the element of interest is used as the ideal
    internal standard. External calibration is the most commonly used calibration
    strategy for elemental analysis. To reduce the impact of instrumental drift on
    the accuracy of the measurement results, nominally the same amount of an internal
    standard is added to the samples and the standards. Standard addition is a calibration
    strategy that could eliminate the issue of matrix effects for trace and ultra-trace
    elemental analysis, because the calibration standards are added as spikes to aliquots
    of the sample to prepare the calibration curve. The purpose of the study was to
    compare the results obtained for the analysis of trace elements in soil samples
    using the calibration strategies of isotope dilution analysis; gravimetric external
    calibration with gravimetric internal standardisation; as well as gravimetric
    standard addition with gravimetric internal standardisation. The aim was to show
    that the application of gravimetric preparation to the more routine calibration
    approaches of external calibration and standard addition could achieve very comparable
    results and associated measurement uncertainties to isotope dilution analysis.
    The application of gravimetric sample preparation could assist routine laboratories,
    that have significant resource constraints, to improve the accuracy of their measurement
    results. These approaches could also be used in the experimental homogeneity and
    stability studies required for the production of reference materials, where high
    precision methods are required.</p>
