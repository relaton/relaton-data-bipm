abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a full characterization of a Dual Josephson
    Impedance Bridge (DJIB) at frequencies up to 80 kHz by using the DJIB to compare
    the best available impedance standards that are (a) directly traceable to the
    quantum Hall effect, (b) used as part of international impedance comparisons,
    or (c) believed to have calculable frequency dependence. The heart of the system
    is a dual Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) source that offers unprecedented
    flexibility in high-precision impedance measurements. The JAWS sources allow a
    single bridge to compare impedances with arbitrary ratios and phase angles in
    the complex plane. The uncertainty budget shows that both the traditional METAS
    bridges and the DJIB have comparable uncertainties in the kilohertz range. This
    shows that the advantages of the DJIB, including the flexibility which allows
    the comparison of arbitrary impedances, the wide frequency range and the automated
    balancing procedure, are obtained without compromising the measurement uncertainties.
    These results demonstrate that this type of instrument can considerably simplify
    the realization and maintenance of the various impedance scales. In addition,
    the DJIB is a very sensitive tool for investigating the frequency-dependent systematic-errors
    that can occur in impedance construction and in the voltage provided by the JAWS
    source at frequencies greater than 10 kHz.</p>
