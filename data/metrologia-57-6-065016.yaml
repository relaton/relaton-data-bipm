abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>As a radiance temperature standard source for the Chinese high-resolution
    spectrum infrared spectrometer, the National Institute of Metrology, China, developed
    a spaceborne radiance temperature standard blackbody (SRTSB) combined with a series
    of miniature phase change fixed points (MPCFPs) for temperature calibration and
    emissivity verification using a thermal radiation loop (TRL). The MPCFPs of the
    SRTSB contain H<sub>2</sub>O, Ga, Gaâ€“Sn alloy, and phenyl salicylate. The TRL
    is used to measure the emissivity of the spaceborne blackbody on the basis of
    controlling environmental radiation. Experimental results show that the blackbody
    emissivity is higher than 0.998 and the temperature control stability is better
    than 5 mK. Temperature control uniformity at the cavity bottom and axial are better
    than or equal to 11 mK and 38 mK, respectively, in the working temperature range
    of 268.15 K to 331.15 K.. The repeatability of the MPCFPs is less than 5 mK, and
    the results of the continuous phase transition of the MPCFPs are in a clear temperature
    plateau. The expanded uncertainty of the SRTSB is lower than or equal to 0.084
    K (k = 2).</p>
