    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Key comparisons provide the means to assess the comparability of measurement capabilities at National Metrology Institutes and Designated Institutes worldwide. In addition, they provide a snapshot of the state of the art in measurement science and inform advances in metrology. Key comparisons provide essential information on assessing whether the metrology community can meet the needs of stakeholders. Using examples from gas metrology, we explore the mechanisms for benchmarking the success of a key comparison and a new approach for assessing individual laboratory performance.</p>
