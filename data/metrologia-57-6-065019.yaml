abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this study, we report an approach to achieve sequence-specific
    counting of single DNA molecules, which is required for more versatile applications
    of the previously reported absolute DNA quantification technique based on flow
    cytometric DNA single molecule counting. While using the same capillary-based
    flow cytometric setup, fluorescence activation of a target DNA was made with a
    number of fluorescent oligonucleotide probes of complementary sequences to that
    of a target DNA. The feasibility of the proposed approach was tested with 7 kb
    single-strand M13 DNA as the target DNA for sequence specific counting for quantification.
    Sample preparation, the number of fluorescent oligonucleotide probes, and hybridization
    conditions mainly matter for the performance of the proposed method. Using a set
    of 30 sequence-specific fluorescent probes with a selected hybridization buffer,
    acceptable performance was confirmed through comparison with other conventional
    methods such as digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR), UV spectrophotometry,
    and deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate analysis by mass spectrometry. Proven comparability
    to the dPCR method confirmed the feasibility of the proposed approach. With further
    improvement in instrumentation, the proposed method is expected to become established
    as a reference measurement procedure for sequence-specific quantification of nucleic
    acids working under a uniquely straightforward measurement principle.</p>
