abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A measurement setup for differential sampling of AC waveforms
    based on a programmable Josephson voltage standard, with an integrating sampler,
    Keysight 3458, and a Δ-Σ analogue-to-digital converter, NI PXI-5922, is described.
    The system operates in several circuit configurations with different synchronization
    and triggering schemes. In particular, the focus is on how the filters implemented
    in the samplers affect sampling measurements. Numerical simulations on the frequency
    response characteristics of low-pass and finite impulse response filters for the
    samplers in differential sampling were performed, and the RMS amplitude of the
    fundamental for waveforms generated from an AC source in a voltage range of 1
    V ≤ V ≤ 7.07 V and a frequency range of 40 Hz ≤ f ≤ 1.02 kHz was measured. The
    RMS amplitudes measured with the different samplers coincided within a few parts
    in 10<sup>7</sup> at frequencies below 100 Hz. However, the difference between
    the amplitudes increased with frequency, mainly due to the dramatic change of
    the value obtained with the integrating sampler. The difference reached up to
    −27 µV/V at 1.02 kHz. This feature is inferred to originate from the difference
    in the bandwidths for the two samplers. The stability of output waveforms for
    an AC source, APx-555, which could serve as a transfer standard in the framework
    of an on-site comparison of two independent differential sampling setups, is evaluated.</p>
