  content: "\n<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>Optical lattice clocks surpass primary Cs
    microwave clocks in frequency stability and accuracy, and are promising candidates
    for a redefinition of the second in the International System of Units (SI). However,
    the robustness of optical lattice clocks has not yet reached a level comparable
    to that of Cs fountain clocks which contribute to International Atomic Time (TAI)
    by the nearly continuous operation. In this paper, we report the long-term operation
    of an <sup>171</sup>Yb optical lattice clock with a coverage of 80.3% for half
    a year including uptimes of 93.9% for the first 24 days and 92.6% for the last
    35 days. This enables a nearly dead-time-free frequency comparison of the optical
    lattice clock with TAI over months, which provides a link to the SI second with
    an uncertainty of low 10<sup>−16</sup>. By using this link, the absolute frequency
    of the <sup>1</sup>S<inline-formula><tex-math><?CDATA $_{0}-^{3}$></tex-math>\n<mml:math

    clock transition of <sup>171</sup>Yb is measured as 518 295 836 590 863.54(26)
    Hz with a fractional uncertainty of 5.0 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. This value is in agreement
    with the recommended frequency of <sup>171</sup>Yb as a secondary representation
    of the second.</p> "
