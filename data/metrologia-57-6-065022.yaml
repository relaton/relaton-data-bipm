abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Several correction factors for primary beta dosimetry in radiation
    protection have been determined by means of measurements and simulations for both
    the well-known Böhm primary standard extrapolation chamber developed at PTB (which
    has been commercially available for a long time) and a new primary standard extrapolation
    chamber also developed at PTB. The correction factors k<sub>el</sub> for electrostatic
    attraction of the entrance window due to the collecting voltage and k<sub>sat</sub>
    for ionisation collection losses due to ionic recombination have been measured.
    The following correction factors have been determined by simulations for normal
    (0°) as well as oblique (15°, 30°, 45° and 60°) radiation incidence: k<sub>ba</sub>
    for backscatter from the collecting electrode, k<sub>pe</sub> for perturbation
    by the chamber’s side walls, and k<sub>ra</sub>, k<sub>ac</sub> and k<sub>di</sub>
    for inhomogeneity inside the collecting volume. The latter three have been combined
    to k<sub>ih</sub>. Six more correction factors adopted from the literature are
    described to complete the necessary corrections. A comparison with values given
    in ISO 6980-2:2004 (for 0°), all determined at that time by means of measurements,
    is shown as well as the application of the new factors to measured data. The newly
    determined correction factors are ready to be implemented in an updated version
    of ISO 6980-2.</p>'
