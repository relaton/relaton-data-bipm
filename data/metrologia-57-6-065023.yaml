abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The BeiDou global navigation satellite system (BDS-3) was formally
    commissioned to provide positioning, velocity, and timing services to global users
    on 31 July 2020. We analyzed its pseudorange measurement noise, the precision
    of conventional common view (CV) and all-in-view (AV) time comparison, and the
    instability of the precise point positioning (PPP) time transfer to assess the
    time transfer performance of BDS-3. We found that the elevation-dependent biases
    found in BDS-2 code measurements are mitigated in BDS-3. The time transfer performance
    of the BDS-3 satellites is over 50% higher than that of the BDS-2 satellites.
    In terms of the CV time comparison, the standard deviations of the zero-baseline
    common clock time comparison of the new BDS-3 signal combination of B1C and B2a
    reach 0.36 ns, which are the same levels for Galileo E1 and E5a and the global
    positioning system (GPS) L1 and L2. In the long baseline AV comparison links over
    7000 km, the standard deviation of the time comparison of the B1C and B2a combination
    also reaches 0.8 ns, and the improved gain is 55% relative to that of the BDS-2
    B1I and B2I. We also tested the PPP time transfer performance with BDS-2 and BDS-3
    satellites and found that the time transfer performance of BDS B1I and B3I is
    comparable to that of GPS L1 and L2.</p>
