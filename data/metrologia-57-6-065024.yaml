abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The National Metrology Institute of Japan realized a total spectral
    radiant flux scale in the visible wavelength range (from 380 nm to 780 nm) for
    sphere-spectroradiometer calibration in 2π geometry. For a transfer standard in
    2π geometry, a standard source based on a specially-designed broadband light-emitting
    diode (2π standard LED) was used. For the scale realization, we used the goniophotometer/spectroradiometer
    system. In the realization, an effect of a bandpass function of the array spectroradiometer
    was corrected by a matrix inversion approach. The relative expanded uncertainty
    (k = 2) for the scale is from 3.3% to 5.7% depending on the wavelength range.
    We also evaluated the contributions of the wavelength calibration and the bandpass
    function to the measurement of the total spectral radiant flux of typical white
    LEDs against the 2π standard LED. Our results demonstrate that the 2π standard
    LED achieves uncertainties comparable to those of a conventional standard lamp,
    within a practical wavelength range for LED measurements. These results show that
    the 2π standard LED is a useful transfer standard for the realization of the total
    spectral radiant flux scale and for evaluation of the total luminous flux of LEDs
    in 2π geometry.</p>
