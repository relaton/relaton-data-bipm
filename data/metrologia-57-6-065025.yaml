    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A single electron pump was incorporated with a quantum Hall resistance and a Josephson voltage for the current evaluation in the framework of Ohm’s law. The pump current of about 60 pA level was amplified by a stable amplifier with a gain of 10<sup>3</sup> to induce a Hall voltage of about 60 mV level across a 1 MΩ Hall resistance array, which was compared with the Josephson voltage. The gain of the current amplifier was calibrated with a cryogenic current comparator bridge. For two different drive frequencies and repeated thermal cycles, the comparisons demonstrated that the pump current averaged over the first plateau was equal to <italic toggle="yes">ef</italic> within the combined uncertainty level of 0.3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 1).</p>
