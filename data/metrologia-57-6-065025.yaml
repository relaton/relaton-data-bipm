abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A single electron pump was incorporated with a quantum Hall
    resistance and a Josephson voltage for the current evaluation in the framework
    of Ohm’s law. The pump current of about 60 pA level was amplified by a stable
    amplifier with a gain of 10<sup>3</sup> to induce a Hall voltage of about 60 mV
    level across a 1 MΩ Hall resistance array, which was compared with the Josephson
    voltage. The gain of the current amplifier was calibrated with a cryogenic current
    comparator bridge. For two different drive frequencies and repeated thermal cycles,
    the comparisons demonstrated that the pump current averaged over the first plateau
    was equal to ef within the combined uncertainty level of 0.3 × 10<sup>−6</sup>
    (k = 1).</p>
