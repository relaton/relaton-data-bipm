abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a measurement of the absolute frequency of the 5
    s<sup>2</sup><sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub> to 5s5p<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub> transition
    in<sup>87</sup>Sr which is a secondary representation of the SI second. We describe
    the optical lattice clock apparatus used for the measurement, and we focus in
    detail on how its systematic frequency shifts are evaluated with a total fractional
    uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−17</sup>. Traceability to the International System
    of Units is provided via comparison to International Atomic Time (TAI). Gathering
    data over 5- and 15-day periods, with the lattice clock operating on average 74%
    of the time, we measure the frequency of the transition to be 429 228 004 229 873.1
    (5) Hz, which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup>.
    We describe in detail how this uncertainty arises from the intermediate steps
    linking the optical frequency standard, through our local time scale UTC(NPL),
    to an ensemble of primary and secondary frequency standards which steer TAI. The
    calculated absolute frequency of the transition is in good agreement with recent
    measurements carried out in other laboratories around the world.</p>
