abstract:
- script: Latn
  content: "\n<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>We present a measurement of the absolute
    frequency of the 5 s<sup>2</sup> <sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub> to 5s5p <sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub>
    transition in <sup>87</sup>Sr which is a secondary representation of the SI second.
    We describe the optical lattice clock apparatus used for the measurement, and
    we focus in detail on how its systematic frequency shifts are evaluated with a
    total fractional uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−17</sup>. Traceability to the International
    System of Units is provided via comparison to International Atomic Time (TAI).
    Gathering data over 5- and 15-day periods, with the lattice clock operating on
    average 74% of the time, we measure the frequency of the transition to be 429 228 004 229 873.1
    (5) Hz, which corresponds to a fractional uncertainty of 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup>.
    We describe in detail how this uncertainty arises from the intermediate steps
    linking the optical frequency standard, through our local time scale UTC(NPL),
    to an ensemble of primary and secondary frequency standards which steer TAI. The
    calculated absolute frequency of the transition is in good agreement with recent
    measurements carried out in other laboratories around the world.</p> "
