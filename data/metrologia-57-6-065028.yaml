abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An international comparison study on the accurate determination
    of the molar mass M(Si) of silicon artificially enriched in<sup>28</sup>Si (x(<sup>28</sup>Si)
    &gt; 0.9999 mol mol<sup>−1</sup>) has been completed. The measurements were part
    of the high level CCQM-P160 pilot study assessing the ability of National Metrology
    Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) to make such measurements at
    the lowest possible levels of measurement uncertainty and to identify possible
    difficulties when measuring this kind of sample.</p><p>This study supports the
    molar mass measurements critical to disseminating the silicon route to realizing
    the new definitions for the kilogram and the mole. Measurements were also made
    by one external research institute and an external company.</p><p>The different
    institutes were free to choose their experimental (mass spectrometric) set-ups
    and equipment, thereby enabling also the comparison of different techniques. The
    investigated material was a chemically pure, polycrystalline silicon material.
    The subsequent modified single crystalline secondary product of this material
    was intended for the production of silicon which was used for two additional spheres
    in the context of the redetermination of the Avogadro constant N<sub>A</sub>,
    required for the revision of the International System of Units (SI) via fundamental
    constants which came into force from May 2019. The CCQM pilot study was organized
    by Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). Aqueous silicon solutions were
    shipped to all participating institutions. The data analysis as well as the uncertainty
    modelling and calculation of the results was predefined. The participants were
    provided with an uncertainty budget as a GUM Workbench<sup>®</sup> file as well
    as a free software license for the duration of the comparison. The agreement of
    the values of the molar mass (M(Si) = 27.976 942 577 g mol<sup>−1</sup>) was excellent
    with ten out of 11 results reported within the range of relative uncertainty of
    1 × 10<sup>−8</sup> required for the revision of the SI.</p>
