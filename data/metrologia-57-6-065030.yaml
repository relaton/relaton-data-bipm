abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this study, we developed a method for calibrating forward
    scatter meters (FSMs) against transmissometers for measuring visibility under
    laboratory conditions, and we designed and constructed a novel fog chamber for
    calibrating FSMs indoors. The fog chamber was used to simulate a controlled visibility
    environment, and a transmissometer was installed on both ends of the fog chamber
    as the standard. The developed method involved a comparison of the FSMs and transmissometer
    in a group of fog events. FSMs were installed on both sides of the optical path
    between the transmitter and receiver of the transmissometer. The chamber door
    was closed, and, after creating fog to simulate low-visibility conditions, measurements
    were collected from the FSMs and transmissometer every minute while the fog dissipated
    very slowly. The measurement errors of the FSM could then be calculated. To evaluate
    this method, tests were conducted in the fog chamber, and the results show that
    the fog chamber could simulate visibility from 10 m to 10 000 m, while the FSMs
    could only be calibrated below a visibility of 1500 m due to the baseline of the
    transmissometer. The fog homogeneity was controlled within 1.2% or less, and the
    stability was limited to 5% per 30 min. These parameters are reasonably homogeneous
    and stable for FSM—transmissometer comparison. Three PWD22 FSMs were calibrated
    using this method, and the calibration uncertainties were estimated to be in the
    range of 7.8% to 9.2%.</p>
