  content: "\n<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>Slow dissolution of the borosilicate container
    of triple-point-of-water (TPW) cell is widely recognized as the main cause of
    long-term drift in observed triple point temperature. We add to the available
    experimental data a comparison of two large batches of TPW cells (67 cells in
    total) of various ages (from 1 year to 64 years), manufacturers (NRC, VSL, Fluke,
    Isotech, etc), and materials (borosilicate glass and fused-silica) which was undertaken
    in 2018. After measuring the TPW temperatures realized by all 67 cells, 12 borosilicate
    cells were opened and their water was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass
    Spectrometry (ICP-MS) in order to correlate their impurity content with their
    respective age and their realized TPW temperature. No direct correlation was observed
    between the TPW cells age/impurity content and their measured triple-point temperature
    for neither borosilicate cells nor fused silica cells (Pearson’s correlation coefficient
    <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub> is within the range −0.60  ≤
     <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>xy</italic></sub>≤ +0.40 for all the pairs considered).
    For fused-silica cells, the results indicate that after the isotopic variation
    in the water source is taken into account, the long-term drift due to the dissolution
    of glass envelope, if any, is negligibly small: (+0.4(±0.6) µK·yr<sup>−1</sup>
    reported herein). Given that all the fused-silica cells realize the TPW temperature
    within 100 µK of NRC and VSL national reference cells and since the analyzed time
    period of 15 years is equal to the average lifespan of a TPW cell, we conclude
    that fused-silica TPW cells are superior to those made from borosilicate glass.</p> "
