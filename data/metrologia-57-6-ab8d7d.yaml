abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We propose a time-scale algorithm for the automated generation
    of a real-time time scale, making full use of the frequency standards available
    in a typical time laboratory. The time-scale algorithm is made by a pre-processing
    stage, a steering algorithm, and a post-processing stage. In particular, in this
    work we propose a set of three different steering algorithms, running in parallel
    and eventually producing a unique steering correction to be applied to a master
    clock. Each algorithm is based on a different steering reference, namely, a primary
    frequency standard, an ensemble clock, and the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
    or its rapid version, UTCr. Pre- and post-processing stages help to provide robustness
    and to cope with data gaps. The proposed algorithms have been extensively and
    successfully tested offline, on real data from the time laboratory of the Italian
    National Institute of Metrological Research (INRiM), where an online test has
    also been performed in the period May-October 2019. Then, since the middle of
    January 2020, the time-scale algorithm has been applied for the generation of
    the Italian legal time scale, UTC(IT). We show here the results of the offline
    tests and of the 5-month online test. The proposed strategy can be used wherever
    a stable, accurate, and robust time reference is needed, e.g. for a local realization
    of UTC in a laboratory k, UTC(k), or for generating the reference time of a global
    navigation satellite system (GNSS).</p>
