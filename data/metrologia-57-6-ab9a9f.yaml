abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from producers
    in the energy and industrial fields to mitigate climate change more effectively,
    accurate and reliable studies of methods capable of estimating GHG emissions with
    proper uncertainty levels should initially be carried out. Continuous emission
    monitoring systems (CEMS) directly measure GHG emissions by measuring the GHG
    concentrations and volumetric flow rates of flue gases in smokestacks. Most studies
    of CEMS have tended to focus on the accuracy and uncertainty levels associated
    with GHG concentrations rather than on volumetric flow measurements. Particularly,
    the uncertainty associated with volumetric gas flow measurements by CEMS at a
    smokestack considering the individual plant must be determined to reduce the overall
    uncertainty. In the present study, the uncertainties of stack gas flow measurements
    with an S-type Pitot tube to estimate GHG emissions by CEMS are evaluated by applying
    the GUM and Monte Carlo methods to an on-site smokestack of an energy power plant.
    Velocity measurements in the stack were conducted using an S-type Pitot tube mainly
    used in Korea. The mathematical model equations of the accumulated volumetric
    gas flowrate measurements for estimating GHG emissions by CEMS are expressed in
    the form of detailed uncertainty equations by GUM. In the uncertainty evaluations
    by GUM, the combined standard uncertainty equation is expressed with the average
    gas flow velocity, stack diameter, static pressure, temperature and water content.
    The relative expanded uncertainty for volumetric gas flowrate measurements with
    an S-type Pitot tube in a smokestack by GUM is estimated to be 3.81% for a coverage
    factor ( k  = 2) at a confidence level of approximately 95%. In addition, the
    Monte Carlo method was applied to evaluate the associated uncertainty of volumetric
    gas flowrate measurements by an S-type Pitot tube for comparison with the results
    by the GUM method. The results of the uncertainty evaluations by GUM and MCM show
    good agreement, with only a 0.05% difference in the uncertainty outcomes.</p>
