abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The linearity of the responsivity of a silicon carbide photodetector
    in the deep-ultraviolet has been studied using a variant of the so-called intensity-ratio
    method in view of the implementation of low-uncertainty Doppler-broadening thermometry
    in mercury vapours. To this purpose, coherent radiation at the wavelength of 254
    nm has been produced by means of non-linear mixing of two visible laser beams
    in a β-barium borate crystal. The linearity has been quantified as a function
    of the exposure power, variable in the range between 50 and 300 nW. It is shown
    that possible deviations from linearity are within the uncertainty of 4 × 10<sup>–5</sup>
    (corresponding to one standard deviation). Such a performance makes the detector
    well suitable for the thermometric application.</p>
