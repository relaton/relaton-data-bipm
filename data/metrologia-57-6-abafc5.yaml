abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measuring the spectral irradiance of solar radiation is required
    in many fields of science and technology. In this work, we present an in-depth
    discussion of the measuring procedure and required corrections for such measurements.
    We also describe our measurement uncertainty analysis, which is based on a Monte-Carlo
    procedure in accordance with the  Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement  (JCGM,
    Paris, 2008). For this purpose, fifteen uncertainty sources are identified, analyzed
    and described analytically. As a specific application example, we describe the
    instrumentation and procedure for determining the spectral irradiance of a solar
    simulator at the ISO/IEC 17 025 accredited solar cell calibration laboratory ISFH
    CalTeC and the corresponding measurement uncertainty analysis. Moreover, we provide
    a Python implementation for this calculation along with the paper. We show that
    for state-of-the-art instrumentation, significant uncertainty contributions arise
    from the reference lamp (primary calibration standard), stray light and signal-to-noise
    ratio. If sharp spectral features are present (which is common, e.g. for Xenon
    lamps), spectral bandwidth and wavelength uncertainty also contribute significantly
    to the overall uncertainty.</p>
