abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Large-effect pigments, due to their strongly specular reflectance,
    produce a special visual texture known as sparkle. The use of these pigments in
    many industries (automotive, cosmetic, paper, architecture...) makes the control
    of this visual texture necessary. Sparkle measurands have been defined in this
    article, so that traceability of sparkle measurements can be provided by national
    metrology institutes or designated institutes. Some of them (Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt, Eidgenössisches Institut für Metrologie, Cesky Metrologicky Institut
    and Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas) have tested their existing
    measurement capabilities for the defined sparkle measurands, and their results
    are presented and thoroughly compared. Two possible sources of systematic error
    have been identified: inadequate illumination and collection solid angles, and
    an inadequate size of the virtual aperture used to assess the luminous flux reflected
    by the effect pigments. Finally, it has been shown that the measures correlate
    excellently with the sparkle visual data. The results shown in this research support
    the sparkle measurands defined here as adequate quantities for defining the standard
    measurement scale of sparkle claimed by industry.</p>'
