abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Slow dissolution of the borosilicate container of triple-point-of-water
    (TPW) cell is widely recognized as the main cause of long-term drift in observed
    triple point temperature. We add to the available experimental data a comparison
    of two large batches of TPW cells (67 cells in total) of various ages (from 1
    year to 64 years), manufacturers (NRC, VSL, Fluke, Isotech, etc), and materials
    (borosilicate glass and fused-silica) which was undertaken in 2018. After measuring
    the TPW temperatures realized by all 67 cells, 12 borosilicate cells were opened
    and their water was analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)
    in order to correlate their impurity content with their respective age and their
    realized TPW temperature. No direct correlation was observed between the TPW cells
    age/impurity content and their measured triple-point temperature for neither borosilicate
    cells nor fused silica cells (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r<sub>xy</sub>
    is within the range −0.60  ≤  r<sub>xy</sub>≤ +0.40 for all the pairs considered).
    For fused-silica cells, the results indicate that after the isotopic variation
    in the water source is taken into account, the long-term drift due to the dissolution
    of glass envelope, if any, is negligibly small: (+0.4(±0.6) µK·yr<sup>−1</sup>
    reported herein). Given that all the fused-silica cells realize the TPW temperature
    within 100 µK of NRC and VSL national reference cells and since the analyzed time
    period of 15 years is equal to the average lifespan of a TPW cell, we conclude
    that fused-silica TPW cells are superior to those made from borosilicate glass.</p>'
