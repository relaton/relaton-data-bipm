abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Chemical measurement laboratories that provide a broad range
    of services rely on efficient and rigorously validated measurement procedures
    to meet industry demands. The success of these laboratories ultimately hinges
    upon their ability to produce results that are both fit-for-purpose and affordable.
    Skillful planning of measurement experiments must therefore provide adequate confidence
    in results without being overly complex. A statistical procedure is presented
    that can be used by laboratories to optimize such experiment designs. Inputs to
    the statistical model are based upon simple criteria such as the number of available
    samples, expected variabilty of calibration data, and the largest acceptable uncertainty
    in the result. The outputs of the model guide a measurement scheme that can provide
    results with as small an uncertainty as possible under specified constraints,
    such as the desired range of calibration and the number of samples and repeated
    measurements that should be made. The method and software used to execute this
    model are demonstrated for planning evaluations of vitamin D in serum that inform
    clinical medicine diagnostics.</p>
