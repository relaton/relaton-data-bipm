abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Key comparisons provide the means to assess the comparability
    of measurement capabilities at National Metrology Institutes and Designated Institutes
    worldwide. In addition, they provide a snapshot of the state of the art in measurement
    science and inform advances in metrology. Key comparisons provide essential information
    on assessing whether the metrology community can meet the needs of stakeholders.
    Using examples from gas metrology, we explore the mechanisms for benchmarking
    the success of a key comparison and a new approach for assessing individual laboratory
    performance.</p>
