abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report on the absolute frequency measurement of the 6s<sup>2
    1</sup>S<sub>0</sub>–6s6p<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub> transition in<sup>171</sup>Yb
    with a fractional uncertainty of 7.3 × 10<sup>–16</sup>. A global positioning
    system carrier phase frequency transfer was established between National Institute
    of Metrology of China and East China Normal University, which linked the optical
    frequency of the ECNU Yb1 clock to the second in the International System of Units
    (SI) through international atomic time. Frequency measurements were carried out
    in 15 separate days with a total time over 3.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> s. The absolute
    frequency was determined to be 518 295 836 590 863.30(38) Hz. Our result is in
    good agreement with the recommended value in neutral Yb as a secondary representation
    of the SI second endorsed by the International Committee for Weights and Measures.</p>
