abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Metrological services from National Metrology Institutes related
    to energy gases have been supported by the programme of key comparisons of the
    Gas Analysis Working Group of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance:
    Metrology in Chemistry and Biology since its conception in 1993. Most of the key
    comparisons have been performed on natural gas composition measurement, which
    is key to the calculation of natural gas properties, thereby facilitating fiscal
    metering and the trade in natural gas. In the recent years, non-conventional energy
    gases and natural gas substitutes, such as refinery gas and biogas have been addressed.
    The paper gives an overview over the achievements in this area from the first
    key comparison (CCQM-K1) onward and outlines the current challenges to the metrological
    community. The ongoing energy transition towards renewable energy gases is at
    the centre of these challenges. The associated emerging challenges primarily concern
    the measurement of the concentrations of impurities, such as silicon in biomethane
    and upgraded biogas, carbon monoxide in hydrogen, and many others. The paper presents
    the first results of the development of measurement standards and methods for
    impurities in biogas, biomethane and hydrogen and the implications for the programme
    of key comparisons.</p>'
