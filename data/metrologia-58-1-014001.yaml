abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we provide guidance on a Bayesian uncertainty
    evaluation for a large class of GUM measurement models covering linear and non-linear
    models. Bayesian analysis takes advantage of useful prior knowledge on the measurand,
    which is often available from a metrologistâ€™s genuine expertise and opinion, or
    from previous experiments and which is neither taken into account by the GUM nor
    by its Supplement 1. For the considered class of measurement models, we establish
    the equivalence with the related statistical models and derive analytical expressions
    of the posterior distribution for an appropriate family of prior distributions,
    which allows one to gain insight into the result of the Bayesian uncertainty evaluation.
    We extend this work to the formulation of arbitrary prior distributions for the
    measurand and provide some guidance to set hyperparameter values within a class
    of priors based on elicitation techniques, so that the resulting priors reflect
    the prior knowledge. Posterior distributions are calculated by Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo methods. We apply the Bayesian uncertainty evaluation to the mass calibration
    example of Supplement 1 and compare our results with those obtained by the GUM
    and its Supplement 1. In order to study the impact of the choice of method for
    this example, we carry out a sensitivity analysis of the results with respect
    to the choice of prior. We show a virtually strong effect of the prior distribution
    which results in reduced uncertainty estimates for a small number of observations.
    When using noninformative priors, we obtain results comparable to those achieved
    by GUM-S1. Python code is made available that enables a Bayesian uncertainty evaluation
    also in other applications covered by the considered class of GUM measurement
    models.</p>
