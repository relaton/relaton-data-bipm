abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Low-rank matrix recovery allows a low-rank matrix to be reconstructed
    when only a fraction of its elements is available. In this paper, an approximate
    Bayesian approach to low-rank matrix recovery is developed and its potential benefit
    for an application in metrology explored. The approach extends a recently proposed
    Bayesian low-rank matrix recovery procedure by utilizing a Gaussian Markov random
    field (GMRF) prior. The GMRF prior accounts for spatial smoothness, which is relevant
    for applications such as quantitative magnetic resonance imaging and nano Fourier
    transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The approach proposed here is automatic
    in that its hyperparameters are estimated from the data. Application to nano-FTIR
    spectroscopy demonstrates that the effort required to perform experiments in the
    time-consuming measurement of multi-dimensional data can be reduced significantly.
    Software for the proposed approach is available upon request.</p>
