abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We revisit the problem of choosing combinations of sources for
    multi-wavelength interferometry, using the risk of assigning the wrong integer
    interference order to a measured phase as a quantitative criterion. We model this
    risk, explicitly accounting for the experimenterâ€™s ability to reject implausible
    measurement results. We present a general reliability limit for the method of
    exact fractions, which can be used as a benchmark when evaluating wavelength combinations,
    as well as performance estimates for several promising combinations.</p>
