    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper presents the implementation of an electronic fully-digital impedance bridge optimized for <italic toggle="yes">RC</italic> comparisons with equal impedance magnitudes, together with an evaluation of the uncertainty. This bridge has been designed with the goal of realizing the farad directly from the quantum Hall effect with a bridge uncertainty component at the 10<sup>−7</sup> level. Thanks to its simple design, ease of operation and affordability, this bridge is suitable to be industrially manufactured. Together with the increasing availability of graphene quantum Hall resistance standards, this can provide an affordable quantum realization of the unit farad for metrology institutes and calibration centres.</p>
    <p>In this paper we present the uncertainty budget of an example measurement and the results of the validation of the bridge against a suitably modified version of the traceability chain of the Italian national standard of capacitance. The combined uncertainty of the bridge resulted from repeated measurements (overall measurement time of about 200 min) is 9.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, suitable for the primary realization of the unit of capacitance from a quantized Hall resistance standard. The crosstalk among the channels of the electrical generator is the most significant uncertainty component, possibly reducible with internal shielding and filtering of the electronic generator.</p>
