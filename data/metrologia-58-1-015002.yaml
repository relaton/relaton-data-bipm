abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the implementation of an electronic fully-digital
    impedance bridge optimized for RC comparisons with equal impedance magnitudes,
    together with an evaluation of the uncertainty. This bridge has been designed
    with the goal of realizing the farad directly from the quantum Hall effect with
    a bridge uncertainty component at the 10<sup>−7</sup> level. Thanks to its simple
    design, ease of operation and affordability, this bridge is suitable to be industrially
    manufactured. Together with the increasing availability of graphene quantum Hall
    resistance standards, this can provide an affordable quantum realization of the
    unit farad for metrology institutes and calibration centres.</p><p>In this paper
    we present the uncertainty budget of an example measurement and the results of
    the validation of the bridge against a suitably modified version of the traceability
    chain of the Italian national standard of capacitance. The combined uncertainty
    of the bridge resulted from repeated measurements (overall measurement time of
    about 200 min) is 9.2 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, suitable for the primary realization
    of the unit of capacitance from a quantized Hall resistance standard. The crosstalk
    among the channels of the electrical generator is the most significant uncertainty
    component, possibly reducible with internal shielding and filtering of the electronic
    generator.</p>
