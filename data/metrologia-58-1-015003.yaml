abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the ‘lift-off
    effect’ in zinc open cells, where an anomalously large change in temperature is
    observed when the standard platinum resistance thermometer (SPRT) is lifted off
    the bottom of the re-entrant tube during an immersion profile measurement. The
    goal was to determine the most important influences and hence what measures could
    be taken to mitigate it. The influences investigated were the filling gas, re-entrant
    tube material, re-entrant tube exterior surface condition, and the SPRT design.
    For each of these influence variables, three options were chosen. Since testing
    all combinations of different configurations arising would be extremely time consuming,
    the authors employed the optimal ‘design of experiments’ method using orthogonal
    arrays described by the Taguchi method, which is commonly used in manufacturing
    to optimise processes. Nine test configurations were identified, giving the necessary
    information on the interrelation between all influence variables. According to
    these results, the ideal configuration that yields the optimum immersion profile
    is a borosilicate tube, with full sandblasting and using nitrogen as filling gas
    for the cell. In addition, one particular SPRT design was found to be the least
    sensitive to the lift-off effect.</p>
