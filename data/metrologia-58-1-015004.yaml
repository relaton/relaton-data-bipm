abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Atomic interferometry methods used to measure the Newtonian
    gravitational constant. To improve the accuracy, one should measure the phase
    of an atomic interferometer at extreme values of atomic vertical velocities and
    coordinates. Owing to symmetry, the horizontal components of atomic velocities
    and coordinates are also extreme. We propose using a source mass consisting of
    three or more parts, since only in this case one can find such an arrangement
    of parts that all atomic variables become extreme. Nonlinear dependences of the
    phase on the uncertainties of atomic positions and velocities near those extreme
    values required us to modify the expression for the phase relative standard deviation.
    Moreover, taking into account nonlinear terms in the phase dependence on the atomic
    coordinates and velocities leads to a phase shift. In the last experiment to measure
    the Newtonian gravitational constant by atomic interferometry, this shift was
    not included. We took the shift into account, got a value of 199 ppm for it, and
    this leads to a decrease in the value of the Newton constant by 0.02%. In addition,
    we showed that at equal sizes of the atomic cloud in the vertical and horizontal
    directions, as well as at equal atomic vertical and transverse temperatures, systematic
    errors due to the finite size and temperature of the cloud disappear. The calculation
    also showed that when using the 13-ton source mass proposed recently, the measurement
    accuracy can reach 17 ppm for a source mass consisting of four quarters. We assumed
    that the source mass consisting of a set of cylinders is used for measurements.
    We have obtained a new analytical expression for the gravitational field of a
    homogeneous cylinder.</p>
