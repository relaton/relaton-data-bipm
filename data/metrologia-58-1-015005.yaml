abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We report direct measurements of the frequency ratio of the
    642 THz \n \n S1/22(F=0)–F7/22(F=3)\n \n electric octupole transition in<sup>171</sup>Yb<sup>+</sup>
    and the 429 THz \n \n S01–P03\n \n transition in<sup>87</sup>Sr. A series of 107
    measurements has been performed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt between
    December 2012 and October 2019. Long-term variations of the ratio are larger than
    expected from the individual measurement uncertainties of few 10<sup>−17</sup>.
    The cause of these variations remains unknown. Even taking these into account,
    we find a fractional uncertainty of the frequency ratio of 2.5 × 10<sup>−17</sup>,
    which improves upon previous knowledge by one order of magnitude. The average
    frequency ratio is \n \n νYb+/νSr=1.495991618544900537(38). This represents one
    of the most accurate measurements between two different atomic species to date.</p>"
