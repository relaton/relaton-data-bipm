abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In this work, we review the viability and precision of the
    photon-momentum-based optical power measurement method that employs an amplification
    effect caused by a multi-reflected laser beam trapped in an optical cavity. Measuring
    the total momentum transfer of the absorbed and re-emitted photons from a highly
    reflective surface (reflection of the laser beam from an optical mirror) as a
    force provides the possibility of measuring the optical power with direct traceability
    to SI units. Trial measurements were performed at two different metrology laboratories:
    the laboratory for mass/force at the Technical University of Ilmenau, and the
    clean room laser radiometry laboratory at PTB, with a portable force measurement
    setup consisting of two electromagnetic force compensation balances. We compared
    the results of the optical power measurements performed with the force measurement
    setup, via the photon-momentum-based method, with those performed using a calibrated
    reference standard detector traceable to PTB’s primary standard for optical power,
    the cryogenic radiometer. The comparison was carried out for an optical power
    range between 1 W and 10 W at a wavelength of 532 nm, which corresponds to a force
    of approximately 2000 nN at the upper limit, yielding approximately 2.3% relative
    standard uncertainty in the case of 33 reflections. Thus, conflating the high-precision
    force metrology technique at μN to nN levels with the optical setup required to
    achieve specular multi-reflection configuration of the laser beam, where a macroscopic
    optical cavity with ultra-high reflective mirrors (&gt;99.995%) can adjustably
    be suspended from the force sensors, depending on required geometry of reflections,
    we show that the uncertainty of the optical power measurements upon further increase
    of the nominally applied optical power, the number of laser beam reflections,
    or the reflectivity coefficient of the mirrors can be markedly reduced.</p>'
