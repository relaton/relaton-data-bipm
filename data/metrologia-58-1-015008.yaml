    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report improved frequency ratio measurement with <sup>87</sup>Sr and <sup>171</sup>Yb optical lattice clocks at the National Metrology Institute of Japan. The <sup>87</sup>Sr optical lattice clock is enhanced with several major modifications and is re-evaluated with a reduced uncertainty of 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. We employed a <sup>171</sup>Yb optical lattice clock with an uncertainty of 4 × 10<sup>−16</sup> that was developed for contributing to International Atomic Time. The measurement result is <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic>
                   <sub>Yb</sub>/<italic toggle="yes">ν</italic>
                   <sub>Sr</sub> = 1.207 507 039 343 338 58(49)<sub>sys</sub>(6)<sub>stat</sub> with a fractional uncertainty of 4.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, which is 3.4 times smaller than our previous measurement result.</p>
