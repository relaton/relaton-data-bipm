abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Underwater distance measurement has been playing an important
    role in the fields of underwater navigation, search and rescue, and bathymetric
    survey. However, limited by the measurement sources (e.g. acoustic pulses or incoherent
    optical pulses), the precision can only achieve centimeter level at best, which
    greatly obstructs the advancement of underwater science and technology. Recent
    developments of optical frequency combs have given rise to revolutionary progress
    in metrology, spectroscopy, and optical distance measurement in air. However,
    frequency comb-based underwater distance measurement has rarely been reported.
    In this work, we describe a spectral interferometry-based method using a laser
    frequency comb at 518 nm (green light), which is capable of underwater distance
    measurement with high precision and accuracy. Due to the inherently dispersive
    characteristic of water, the measurement pulse will be chirped, and the spectrograms
    exhibit unstable oscillations, the spectral phase of which features a quadratic
    law. Distances up to 4.4 m and displacements down to 5 μm underwater can be determined
    by virtue of the spectral phases. The experimental results show the differences
    within ±4 μm at 4.4 m range, compared to the reference values. The Allan deviation
    is 1.596 μm at 5 s averaging time, 481 nm at 100 s averaging time, and can achieve
    261 nm with 540 s averaging time. Our work could provide a promising and powerful
    tool for underwater distance measurement with high precision at long range, and
    open the door to a host of underwater applications related to the measurement
    of distance, e.g. mapping and positioning.</p>
