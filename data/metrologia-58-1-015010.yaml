abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have demonstrated operation of a new photon momentum radiometer
    for measuring laser power levels above 1 kW by use of radiation pressure. The
    ‘axial’ design allows the input and output laser beams to remain collinear and
    the force sensing can be carried out with any analytical balance having a vertical
    sensing direction and sufficient readability (sensitivity). The design also provides
    for a parasitic fast photodiode power measurement that is calibrated in situ by
    the slower radiation pressure-based power measurement. This permits a short-time-constant
    measurement limited primarily by the photodiode bandwidth, rather than the response
    time of the force balance. Uncertainty contributions yield a relative expanded
    uncertainty of 2.1% for (1–2) kW and 1.2% above 2 kW (for laboratory environmental
    conditions). We perform a direct comparison between this new power meter and the
    existing primary standard radiation pressure power meter. We find the two techniques
    agree with an average inequivalence of 0.12% for continuous wave (CW) optical
    powers from (1–10.8) kW. This disagreement is well-explained by the quadrature-summed
    uncertainties of the two techniques.</p>
