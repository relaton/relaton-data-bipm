abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a metrological approach of spectral unmixing
    for automatic identification and quantitative analysis of γ-emitting radionuclides
    in natural background radiation at low statistics. Based on full-spectrum analysis,
    the proposed method relies on the maximum likelihood estimation based on Poisson
    statistics that accounts for the spectral signatures of the γ-emitters to be identified
    and natural background. In order to obtain robust decision-making at low statistics,
    a sparsity constraint is implemented along with counting estimation given by spectral
    unmixing. In contrast with the standard approach, this technique relies on a single
    decision threshold applied for a likelihood ratio test. Standard deviations on
    estimated counting are determined using the Fisher information matrix. The robustness
    of decision-making and counting estimation was investigated by means of Monte
    Carlo calculations based on experimental spectral signatures of two types of scintillation
    detectors [NaI(Tl), plastic]. This study demonstrates that sparse spectral unmixing
    is a reliable method for γ-spectra analysis based on low-level measurements. The
    sparsity constraint acts as an efficient technique for decision-making in the
    case of complex mixtures of γ-emitters with significant contribution of natural
    background. This method also yields unbiased counting estimation related to the
    identified radionuclides. Reliable assessment of standard deviations are obtained
    and the Gaussian approximation of the coverage intervals is validated. The proposed
    method can be applied either by non-expert users for automatic analysis of γ-spectra
    or to help experts in decision-making in the case of complex mixtures of γ-emitters
    at low statistics.</p>
