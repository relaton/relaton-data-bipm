abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Since the redefinition of the base unit kelvin via fixing the
    Boltzmann constant in 2019, it has been possible to realise the unit applying
    different gas-thermometry methods in accordance with the ‘Mise en pratique for
    the definition of the kelvin in the SI’. For this application, the use of data
    for the gas properties resulting from ab initio calculations is of special interest
    because it makes primary thermometry much easier. But since a rigorous estimation
    of the uncertainty of theoretical calculations is at least very complex, if not
    impossible, a check of the results by a comparison with highly-accurate experimental
    values is mandatory. Such a check is performed for the second virial coefficient
    of helium, which is a widely used measuring gas, in the temperature range from
    3.7 K to 273 K. For obtaining highly-accurate second-virial-coefficient values
    (relative uncertainty at a few tenth of a percent level or even better), isotherms
    were measured with the PTB dielectric-constant gas thermometer. The highly-accurate
    isotherm data were evaluated by fitting, applying an extended working equation
    for the dependence of the gas pressure on the dielectric constant. The comparison
    with the results of the latest ab initio calculations shows coincidence within
    the combined uncertainty estimates.</p>
