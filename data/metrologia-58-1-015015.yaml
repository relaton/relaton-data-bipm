abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents a detailed assessment of two rectangular
    metallic waveguide lines in order that they can be used as primary standards to
    provide metrological traceability for electrical scattering parameter measurements
    at submillimetre wavelengths. The assessment comprises a series of dimensional
    measurements to determine the overall quality of the lines in terms of the waveguide
    aperture size and alignment. This is followed by electrical measurements to confirm
    the electrical behaviour of the lines. Finally, the lines are employed as standards
    to calibrate a vector network analyser which is used to measure devices to verify
    the performance of the lines as calibration standards, in operando. The waveguide
    size is WM-380, which operates from 500 GHz to 750 GHz.</p>
