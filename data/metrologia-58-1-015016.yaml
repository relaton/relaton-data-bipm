abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>We use an array of transition-edge sensors, cryogenic microcalorimeters
    with 4 eV energy resolution, to measure L x-ray emission-line profiles of four
    elements of the lanthanide series: praseodymium, neodymium, terbium, and holmium.
    The spectrometer also surveys numerous x-ray standards in order to establish an
    absolute-energy calibration traceable to the international system of units for
    the energy range 4 keV to 10 keV. The new results include emission line profiles
    for 97 lines, each expressed as a sum of one or more Voigt functions; improved
    absolute energy uncertainty on 71 of these lines relative to existing reference
    data; a median uncertainty on the peak energy of 0.24 eV, four to ten times better
    than the median of prior work; and six lines that lack any measured values in
    existing reference tables. The 97 lines comprise nearly all of the most intense
    L lines from these elements under broad-band x-ray excitation. The work improves
    on previous measurements made with a similar cryogenic spectrometer by the use
    of sensors with better linearity in the absorbed energy and a gold x-ray absorbing
    layer that has a Gaussian energy-response function. It also employs a novel sample
    holder that enables rapid switching between science targets and calibration targets
    with excellent gain balancing. Most of the results for peak energy values shown
    here should be considered as replacements for the currently tabulated standard
    reference values, while the line shapes given here represent a significant expansion
    of the scope of available reference data.</p>'
