    <p>We perform absolute measurement of the <sup>27</sup>Al<sup>+</sup> single-ion and <sup>87</sup>Sr neutral lattice clock frequencies at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and JILA at the University of Colorado against a global ensemble of primary frequency standards. Over an eight month period multiple measurements yielded the mean optical atomic transition frequencies <inline-formula>
