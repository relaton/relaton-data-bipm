abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In order to fulfil its mission to ensure and promote the global
    comparability of measurements, the BIPM operates laboratories in the fields of
    physical metrology, time, ionizing radiation and chemistry. These laboratories
    act as centres for scientific and technical collaboration between member states
    providing capabilities for international measurement comparisons on a shared cost
    basis. They coordinate international comparisons of national measurement standards
    agreed to be of the highest priority, and they establish and maintain appropriate
    reference standards for use as the basis of key international comparisons at the
    highest level and provide selected calibrations from them. The BIPM sustained
    all of its key activities throughout the periods of confinement resulting from
    the global pandemic in 2020 including: the publication of Circular T each month,
    the annual World Metrology Day celebrations and the launch of the new key comparison
    database (KCDB 2.0). Several activities were brought forward in the work programme
    including the automation of data handling in the International Reference System
    (SIR) for radionuclide metrology and on-line technical exchanges and capacity
    building initiatives. The BIPM has also worked to understand how best to support
    the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) as a ‘new normal’ emerges. As a first
    step, the NMI ‘COVID action’ repository was implemented and two pilot studies
    were launched by the CCQM on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
    New ways have been developed to support the International Committee for Weights
    and Measures (CIPM) consultative committees on-line. For example, during 2020
    a total of 70 video meetings were held for the CCQM, with similar trends for other
    CCs. In the following sections, we provide highlights of the work the laboratories
    have undertaken during 2020.</p>'
