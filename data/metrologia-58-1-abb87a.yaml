abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have developed a primary measurement standard for trace moisture
    in Ar in the range of 10 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to 1 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> in the
    amount-of-substance fraction (mole fraction) using the previously developed multi-gas
    trace-moisture generator. The relative expanded uncertainty (k = 2) of the primary
    standard in Ar was between 2.7 % and 1.5 %. The performance of a moisture analyzer
    (MA) based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), which is considered to be
    the best existing device thus far for trace-moisture measurement, was tested through
    a comparison with the primary standard in Ar. The readings of the CRDS-based MA
    were approximately 10 % lower than the numerical values of the primary standard.
    The relative standard deviation of the readings became approximately 15 %, which
    was 15 times as large as that for N<sub>2</sub>. These were caused by a failure
    in the default setting of the MA for Ar and could be improved by optimizing the
    setting.</p>
