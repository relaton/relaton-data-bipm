abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report improved frequency ratio measurement with<sup>87</sup>Sr
    and<sup>171</sup>Yb optical lattice clocks at the National Metrology Institute
    of Japan. The<sup>87</sup>Sr optical lattice clock is enhanced with several major
    modifications and is re-evaluated with a reduced uncertainty of 1.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>.
    We employed a<sup>171</sup>Yb optical lattice clock with an uncertainty of 4 ×
    10<sup>−16</sup> that was developed for contributing to International Atomic Time.
    The measurement result is ν<sub>Yb</sub>/ν<sub>Sr</sub> = 1.207 507 039 343 338 58(49)<sub>sys</sub>(6)<sub>stat</sub>
    with a fractional uncertainty of 4.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, which is 3.4 times smaller
    than our previous measurement result.</p>
