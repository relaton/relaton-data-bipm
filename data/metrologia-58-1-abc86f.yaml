- content: "Abstract<p>We report direct measurements of the frequency ratio of the
    642 THz  \n                     \n                      S    1  /  2          2
    \    (   F  =  0   )   –    F    7  /  2          2     (   F  =  3   )   \n                    \n
    \                electric octupole transition in<sup>171</sup>Yb<sup>+</sup> and
    the 429 THz  \n                     \n                      S    0          1

    in<sup>87</sup>Sr. A series of 107 measurements has been performed at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt between December 2012 and October 2019. Long-term variations of
    the ratio are larger than expected from the individual measurement uncertainties
    of few 10<sup>−17</sup>. The cause of these variations remains unknown. Even taking
    these into account, we find a fractional uncertainty of the frequency ratio of
    2.5 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, which improves upon previous knowledge by one order of
    magnitude. The average frequency ratio is  \n                     \n                      ν
    \     Y  b    +      /    ν    S  r    =  1.495    991    618    544    900    537
    \  (   38   ). This represents one of the most accurate measurements between two
    different atomic species to date.</p>"
