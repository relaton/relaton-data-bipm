abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Small datasets comprising observations made under conditions
    of repeatability or of reproducibility pervade the practice of measurement science.
    Many laboratories typically will make only one determination, occasionally they
    will make two, and only rarely will they make three or more replicate determinations
    of the same measurand. Interlaboratory comparisons, including key comparisons,
    and meta-analyses, often involve only a handful of participants. These limitations
    pose considerable challenges to the production of reliable uncertainty evaluations.
    This contribution, intended for metrologists, describes techniques that may be
    employed to address this challenge either when the only information in hand is
    what those few observations provide, or when there also is preexisting knowledge
    about the measurement procedure or about the measurand. Although the technical
    details vary, the key message is persistently the same: that there is no universal
    solution to the challenges raised by small datasets, and that if a measurand is
    worth measuring, then the observations deserve a customized treatment responsive
    to the peculiarities of the case, and a level of effort sufficient to render the
    final result fit for its intended purpose. The focus is on the measurement of
    scalar measurands, similarly to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in
    Measurement (GUM), but the range of measurement models considered is much wider
    than the GUM entertains. We review the advantages of the Hodges–Lehmann estimator,
    as a general purpose replacement for the arithmetic average, in all cases where
    the replicated observations are approximately symmetrically distributed around
    a central, typical value. We illustrate the application of empirical Bayes methods
    to uncertainty evaluations, in particular in the context of data reductions of
    small data sets. Metrologists who are skeptical about the use of subjective prior
    distributions may derive some value from this novel application, and thereby develop
    an appreciation for how Bayesian procedures can help address the challenges posed
    by small datasets. The estimates of the measurand that different approaches produce
    often agree, at least approximately, but the corresponding uncertainty quantifications
    may differ markedly. In one example, involving three observations, a Bayesian
    approach yields a coverage interval appreciably narrower than the GUM’s approach.
    In another example, involving only two observations, an approach involving far
    less restrictive assumptions than those made in the GUM, produces a confidence
    interval that is almost as narrow as the conventional interval.</p>'
