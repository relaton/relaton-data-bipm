abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance
    between the EMI (United Arab Emirates) and the BIPM carried out in 2020. Two 1
    Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The comparison
    was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards were measured
    first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a period of about
    one month at the EMI, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal
    dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison
    forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13b
    (for 10 kΩ).</p><p>The results from the EMI and the BIPM were found to be in good
    agreement, with a difference D smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty
    Uc (95% confidence, k = 2) giving D = -0.057 × 10-6, Uc = 0.400 × 10-6 for 1 Ω
    and D = 0.017 × 10-6, Uc = 0.194 × 10-6 for 10 kΩ.</p><p>To reach the main text
    of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
