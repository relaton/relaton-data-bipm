abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A comparison of AC-DC Voltage Transfer Standards between TÜBİTAK
    (Turkey), NMCC SASO (Saudi Arabia), NIS (Egypt) and NMISA (South Africa) conducted
    between February 2018 and April 2019. Fluke 792A is used as the traveling standard
    and TÜBİTAK acted as the pilot laboratory. Measurements are performed at 10 mV,
    3 V @ 10 Hz, 55 Hz, 1 kHz, 20 kHz, 100 kHz and 1 MHz, and 1000 V @ 55 Hz, 1 kHz
    and 20 kHz.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
