abstract:
- content: Main text<p>RF current monitoring probes are commonly utilized in measurements
    of disturbance currents of cables without making direct conductive contact with
    the source conductor and without modification of its circuit. They must be calibrated
    by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) or accredited calibration laboratories
    in accordance with international standards such as CISPR 16-1-2 or ISO 11452-4.
    The RF current monitor probe comparison measurements were conducted with 8 participants;
    five national metrology institutes (NMIs), two designated institutes (DI) and
    one commercial calibration laboratory at the frequencies 0.01 MHz, 0.1 MHz, 1
    MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz, 300 MHz, 400 MHz and 500 MHz in order to obtain
    the transfer impedance of the RF current monitoring probe. The comparison measurements
    started in September 2019 and were completed in June 2020.</p><p>To reach the
