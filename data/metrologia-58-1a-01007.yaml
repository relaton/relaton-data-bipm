abstract:
- content: Main text<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K10.b, a
    direct comparison of the Josephson array voltage standards of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the National Metrology Institute of Finland (VTT
    MIKES), Espoo, Finland, was carried out in October 2019 at the level of 10 V.
    For this exercise, the option A of the BIPM.EM-K10.b comparison protocol was partially
    applied. Option A required the MIKES to provide a reference voltage with its Josephson
    voltage standard for measurement by the BIPM using an analogue nanovoltmeter and
    associated measurement cables. Since no sufficiently stable voltage could be achieved
    in this configuration, a digital detector was used instead. In all cases the BIPM
    array was kept floating from ground.</p><p>The final results were in good agreement
    within the combined relative standard uncertainty of 2.5 parts in 10<sup>10</sup>
    for the nominal voltage of 10 V.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
