abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance
    between the NSAI-NML (Ireland) and the BIPM carried out from November 2020 to
    March 2021. Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were
    used. The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements;
    the standards were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month,
    then for a period of about one month at the NSAI-NML, and finally again at the
    BIPM. The measurand was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was
    the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons
    BIPM.EM-K13.a (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13b (for 10 kΩ).</p><p>The results from the
    NSAI-NML and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference D
    smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty U<sub>c</sub> (95% confidence,
    k = 2) giving D = - 0.081 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, U<sub>c</sub> = 0.180 × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    for 1 Ω and D = 0.069 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, U<sub>c</sub> = 0.424 × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    for 10 kΩ.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
