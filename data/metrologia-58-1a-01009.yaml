abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The ongoing on-site comparison BIPM.EM-K12 is part of the BIPM
    programme implemented to verify the international coherence of the primary resistance
    standards. It allows National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) to validate their implementations
    of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) for dc resistance traceability by comparison
    to the reference maintained at the BIPM.</p><p>The realization of the ohm from
    the QHE-based standard of the NMIs at 100 Ω is compared with that realized by
    the BIPM from its own transportable quantum Hall resistance standard. This comparison
    is usually completed by scaling measurements from 100 Ω to 1 Ω and 10 kΩ through
    the measurement of the resistance ratios 100 Ω/1 Ω and 10 kΩ/100 Ω, respectively.</p><p>In
    March 2019, a new BIPM.EM-K12 on-site comparison was carried out at the National
    Metrology Centre, NMC A*STAR (Singapore). It was the first time the NMC A*STAR
    participated in this comparison programme.</p><p>Only the measurement results
    of the 100 Ω based on the quantum Hall effect and of the 10 kΩ/100 Ω ratio are
    presented in the report. The reason why the results of the 100 Ω/1 Ω ratio were
    not included is explained in the introduction of the report.</p><p>Measurements
    of the 100 Ω transfer standard in terms of the SI value of the von Klitzing constant,
    R<sub>K</sub>, agreed to 1.6 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with a relative combined
    standard uncertainty u<sub>c</sub> = 3.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. Measurements of 10
    kΩ/100 Ω ratio agreed to 2.0 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with u<sub>c</sub> = 2.8
    × 10<sup>−9</sup>.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
