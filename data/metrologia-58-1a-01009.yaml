    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The ongoing on-site comparison BIPM.EM-K12 is part of the BIPM programme implemented to verify the international coherence of the primary resistance standards. It allows National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) to validate their implementations of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) for dc resistance traceability by comparison to the reference maintained at the BIPM.</p>
    <p>The realization of the ohm from the QHE-based standard of the NMIs at 100 Ω is compared with that realized by the BIPM from its own transportable quantum Hall resistance standard. This comparison is usually completed by scaling measurements from 100 Ω to 1 Ω and 10 kΩ through the measurement of the resistance ratios 100 Ω/1 Ω and 10 kΩ/100 Ω, respectively.</p>
    <p>In March 2019, a new BIPM.EM-K12 on-site comparison was carried out at the National Metrology Centre, NMC A*STAR (Singapore). It was the first time the NMC A*STAR participated in this comparison programme. </p>
    <p>Only the measurement results of the 100 Ω based on the quantum Hall effect and of the 10 kΩ/100 Ω ratio are presented in the report. The reason why the results of the 100 Ω/1 Ω ratio were not included is explained in the introduction of the report.</p>
    <p>Measurements of the 100 Ω transfer standard in terms of the SI value of the von Klitzing constant, <italic toggle="yes">R</italic>
                   <sub>K</sub>, agreed to 1.6 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with a relative combined standard uncertainty <italic toggle="yes">u</italic>
                   <sub>c</sub> = 3.3 × 10<sup>−9</sup>. Measurements of 10 kΩ/100 Ω ratio agreed to 2.0 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> with <italic toggle="yes">u</italic>
                   <sub>c</sub> = 2.8 × 10<sup>−9</sup>.</p>
