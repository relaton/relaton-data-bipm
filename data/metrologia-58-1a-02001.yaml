    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The EURAMET.PR-S5 intercomparison of the short circuit current of reference solar cells at standard test conditions was carried out as star type comparison. In total 6 participants with seven facilities took part, 1 from Europe (PTB/Germany with two facilities: the established DSR facility as pilot lab and the new Laser-DSR facility as participant) and 5 outside Europe (NIM/China, VNIIOFI/Russia, KRISS/South Korea, A-STAR/Singapore, ITRI/Chinese Taipei). Therefore, this comparison can be considered as a worldwide one as all NMIs world-wide that had built up facilities for the primary ISTC-calibration of reference solar cells when the measurements started, participated.</p>
    <p>For the calculation of the reference value of the supplementary comparison no participant had to be excluded and the used weighted mean with cut-off has been supported by all participants.</p>
    <p>The unilateral Degrees of Equivalence (DoE) calculated for each participant are fully 100 % consistent with their standard uncertainties. The largest En-value is 0.61 and therefore significant smaller than 1. The chi-square test is fully satisfied with 2.09 &lt; χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 11.07. Thus, the DSR method is highly suitable for the calibration of reference solar cells according to the short circuit current at standard test conditions.</p>
