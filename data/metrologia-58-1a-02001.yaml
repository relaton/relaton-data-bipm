abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The EURAMET.PR-S5 intercomparison of the short circuit current
    of reference solar cells at standard test conditions was carried out as star type
    comparison. In total 6 participants with seven facilities took part, 1 from Europe
    (PTB/Germany with two facilities: the established DSR facility as pilot lab and
    the new Laser-DSR facility as participant) and 5 outside Europe (NIM/China, VNIIOFI/Russia,
    KRISS/South Korea, A-STAR/Singapore, ITRI/Chinese Taipei). Therefore, this comparison
    can be considered as a worldwide one as all NMIs world-wide that had built up
    facilities for the primary ISTC-calibration of reference solar cells when the
    measurements started, participated.</p><p>For the calculation of the reference
    value of the supplementary comparison no participant had to be excluded and the
    used weighted mean with cut-off has been supported by all participants.</p><p>The
    unilateral Degrees of Equivalence (DoE) calculated for each participant are fully
    100 % consistent with their standard uncertainties. The largest En-value is 0.61
    and therefore significant smaller than 1. The chi-square test is fully satisfied
    with 2.09 &lt; χ<sup>2</sup>(5) = 11.07. Thus, the DSR method is highly suitable
    for the calibration of reference solar cells according to the short circuit current
    at standard test conditions.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
