    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>BelGIM, NIM, NIS, NMISA, PTB and VNIIOFI carried out the supplementary comparison on the wavelength for fibre optics. The aim of this comparison is to examine the equivalence of the wavelength for fibre optics among participating laboratories and to provide supporting evidence for the associated CMC claims in BIPM KCDB.</p>
