abstract:
- content: Main text<p>INMETRO, KRISS, METAS and VNIIOFI carried out the supplementary
    comparison on Polarization mode dispersion in optical fiber (PMD). The aim of
    this comparison is to examine the equivalence of the PMD values for fiber optics
    among participating laboratories.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
