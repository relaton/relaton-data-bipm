abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report details the results of the Inter-American Metrology
    System (SIM) key comparison on regular spectral transmittance (SIM.PR-K6.2010).
    Eight national metrology institutes participated in the comparison, which covered
    the spectral range from 380 nm to 1000 nm and the nominal transmittance range
    from 0.1 % to 90 % transmittance. The protocol mirrored that of the key comparison
    conducted by the Consultative Committee on Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR-K6.2010).
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) served as the pilot.
    Each participant received a single set of 5 comparison (neutral density) filters
    to measure. The pilot measured all sets before and after the participant measurements.
    All measurements were completed between December 2016 and February 2018. The results
    of this comparison were linked to the key comparison reference value (KCRV) of
    the CCPR comparison and are expressed in terms of degrees of equivalence. While
    most of the participants can adequately measure spectral regular transmittance
    and evaluate its uncertainty, there are some cases of non-equivalence that will
    require further investigation on the part of the participants.</p><p>To reach

    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
