    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA and the All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements (VNIIOFI), Russia agreed in February 2013 to conduct a comparison on the laser power responsivity at wavelengths of 532 nm, 1.064 μm and 10.6 μm. The aim of this comparison is to assess the equivalence of the laser power responsivity between two laboratories. The comparison was conducted within the COOMET regional metrological organization (COOMET 599/RU/13) and was registered in the BIPM Key Comparison DataBase as a supplementary comparison with the identifier COOMET.PR-S7. The comparison was carried out using one detector head for measuring laser power. The detector head was supplied by VNIIOFI (OPHIR 10A). The results of this comparison essentially demonstrated agreement between the results obtained at the two participating laboratories.</p>
