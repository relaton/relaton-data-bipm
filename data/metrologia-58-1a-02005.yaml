abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
    USA and the All-Russian Research Institute for Optical and Physical Measurements
    (VNIIOFI), Russia agreed in February 2013 to conduct a comparison on the laser
    power responsivity at wavelengths of 532 nm, 1.064 μm and 10.6 μm. The aim of
    this comparison is to assess the equivalence of the laser power responsivity between
    two laboratories. The comparison was conducted within the COOMET regional metrological
    organization (COOMET 599/RU/13) and was registered in the BIPM Key Comparison
    DataBase as a supplementary comparison with the identifier COOMET.PR-S7. The comparison
    was carried out using one detector head for measuring laser power. The detector
    head was supplied by VNIIOFI (OPHIR 10A). The results of this comparison essentially
    demonstrated agreement between the results obtained at the two participating laboratories.</p><p>To

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
