abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison in dew-point temperature in the range of +30
    °C to +95 °C was carried out among the national standards held by NMIJ (pilot),
    MSL (coordinator), RCM-LIPI/SNSU-BSN, SCL, KRISS, NMIM, NMIA, NIMT, CMS/ITRI,
    and NMC, A*STAR. The purpose of the comparison was to establish the degree of
    equivalence between realizations of local scales of dew point temperature of humid
    gas among the participating national institutes. Although the comparison schedule
    was considerably delayed, no significant drift of the transfer standard was observed
    over the whole period of the comparison. The result of a chi-squared test demonstrated
    that the comparison was effective, and the results obtained in the comparison
    can be used as reliable supporting evidence for CMCs that each participant claims.</p><p>To

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCT, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
