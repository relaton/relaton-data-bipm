    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This bilateral SIM key comparison on calibration of gauge blocks by interferometry (SIM.L-K1.2007.1) was carried out between CENAM (México) and INTI (Argentina). Its scope is to support and maintain the claimed Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC) by the participants, which regularly offer the service of gauge block calibration by optical interferometry. The comparison was held from first half of 2018 to second half of 2019, and involved the measurement of eleven steel gauge blocks-eight in the range of short gauge block and three in the range of long gauge block. The reference values for each nominal length were taken as the arithmetic mean. The results of both participants are in good agreement with the reference values for all the gauge blocks measured. This makes the present comparison exercise valid to provide evidence of the participants' competence. The results also provides evidence to support the CMC claims of the participants in gauge block calibration by optical interferometry and for those service that stems out of this key technique as required by the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
