abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This bilateral SIM key comparison on calibration of gauge blocks
    by interferometry (SIM.L-K1.2007.1) was carried out between CENAM (México) and
    INTI (Argentina). Its scope is to support and maintain the claimed Calibration
    and Measurement Capability (CMC) by the participants, which regularly offer the
    service of gauge block calibration by optical interferometry. The comparison was
    held from first half of 2018 to second half of 2019, and involved the measurement
    of eleven steel gauge blocks-eight in the range of short gauge block and three
    in the range of long gauge block. The reference values for each nominal length
    were taken as the arithmetic mean. The results of both participants are in good
    agreement with the reference values for all the gauge blocks measured. This makes
    the present comparison exercise valid to provide evidence of the participants'
    competence. The results also provides evidence to support the CMC claims of the
    participants in gauge block calibration by optical interferometry and for those
    service that stems out of this key technique as required by the CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCL, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
