abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This intercomparison is carried out for step height standards
    with nominal step sizes 8 nm, 18 nm, 88 nm and 10 Âµm using non-contact measurement
    methods, with four participating NMIs. Measurement observation from the pilot
    laboratory exhibit significant stability of step height standards. For each step
    height standard, the supplementary comparison reference value (SCRV) is determined
    using weighted mean, followed by calculation of E<sub>n</sub> values for outlier
    identification. Further the outliers were excluded based upon the Birge Ratio
    consistency test. Measurement results from all the participating NIMs have been
    compiled in this report.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on
    Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM
    key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
