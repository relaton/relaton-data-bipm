    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This intercomparison is carried out for step height standards with nominal step sizes 8 nm, 18 nm, 88 nm and 10 Âµm using non-contact measurement methods, with four participating NMIs. Measurement observation from the pilot laboratory exhibit significant stability of step height standards. For each step height standard, the supplementary comparison reference value (SCRV) is determined using weighted mean, followed by calculation of E<sub>n</sub> values for outlier identification. Further the outliers were excluded based upon the Birge Ratio consistency test. Measurement results from all the participating NIMs have been compiled in this report.</p>
