abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Since 1976, 28 laboratories have submitted 72 samples of<sup>60</sup>Co
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-
    K1.Co-60. Recently, the PTB (Germany) and the TAEK (Turkey) participated in the
    comparison and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been updated to include
    the PTB result. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured
    in the SIR and the updated KCRV have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form of a table. A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>To reach
    the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
