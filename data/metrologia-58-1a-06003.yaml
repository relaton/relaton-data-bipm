abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the VNIIM and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the
    standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty of the comparison
    of 1.9 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms
    of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
