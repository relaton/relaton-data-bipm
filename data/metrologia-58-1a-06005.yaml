    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to water standards of the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (LNE-LNHB), France and the BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 5.9 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
