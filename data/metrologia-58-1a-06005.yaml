abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to
    water standards of the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (LNE-LNHB), France
    and the BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be
    in agreement within the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 5.9 parts in
    10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of
    equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
