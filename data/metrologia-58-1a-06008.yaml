abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to
    water of the Bundesamt für Eich- und Vermessungswesen (BEV), Austria and the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co
    radiation beam of the BIPM in July 2020. The comparison result, based on the calibration
    coefficients for two transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the BEV and
    the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9997 with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 4.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties
    with the comparison carried out in 2009. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
    that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved
    for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
