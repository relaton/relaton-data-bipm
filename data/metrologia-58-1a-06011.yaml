    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Główny Urząd Miar (GUM), Poland and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM during June-July 2020. The comparison result, evaluated as a ratio of the GUM and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0039 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties with the direct comparison carried out in 2006. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
