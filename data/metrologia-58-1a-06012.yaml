    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), Australia and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2020. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the ARPANSA and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9986 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties with the indirect comparison carried out in 2010. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
