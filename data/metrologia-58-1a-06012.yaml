abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the
    Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), Australia
    and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co
    radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2020. The comparison result, based on the
    calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of
    the ARPANSA and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 0.9986 with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 2.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties
    with the indirect comparison carried out in 2010. The results are analysed and
    presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key
    comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
