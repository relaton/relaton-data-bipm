abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to
    water of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA),
    Australia and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried
    out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in November 2020. The comparison
    result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and evaluated
    as a ratio of the ARPANSA and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is
    0.9995 with a combined standard uncertainty of 5.1 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The
    result agrees within the uncertainties with the comparison carried out in 2010.
    The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable
    for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in
    Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
