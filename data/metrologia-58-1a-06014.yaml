    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A first key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the Główny Urząd Miar (GUM), Poland and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM during June-July 2020. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the GUM and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 1.0030 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.5 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
