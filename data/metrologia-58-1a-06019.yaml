abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Since 1976, 29 laboratories have submitted 73 samples of<sup>60</sup>Co
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60.
    Recently, the VNIIM (Russian Federation) participated in the comparison and the
    key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been updated. The degrees of equivalence
    between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the updated KCRV have
    been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical
    presentation is also given.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
