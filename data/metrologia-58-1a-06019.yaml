    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Since 1976, 29 laboratories have submitted 73 samples of <sup>60</sup>Co to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-60. Recently, the VNIIM (Russian Federation) participated in the comparison and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been updated. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the updated KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical presentation is also given.</p>
