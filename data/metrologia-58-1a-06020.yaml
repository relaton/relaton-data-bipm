    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group performed the APMP.RI(I)-K8 key comparison of the reference air kerma rate for high-dose-rate (HDR) <sup>192</sup>Ir brachytherapy sources between 2016 and 2018. Eight laboratories, including seven national metrology institutes (NMIs), took part in the comparison. Two commercial well-type chambers were used as transfer instruments and circulated among the participants. The results showed that the maximum difference between the participants and the BIPM, evaluated using the comparison data of the linking laboratories NMIJ and NRC, was less than 4%. The degrees of equivalence for the participants were calculated, so that results for the six non-linking laboratories may be included in the Key Comparison Database (KCDB).</p>
