abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group performed the APMP.RI(I)-K8
    key comparison of the reference air kerma rate for high-dose-rate (HDR)<sup>192</sup>Ir
    brachytherapy sources between 2016 and 2018. Eight laboratories, including seven
    national metrology institutes (NMIs), took part in the comparison. Two commercial
    well-type chambers were used as transfer instruments and circulated among the
    participants. The results showed that the maximum difference between the participants
    and the BIPM, evaluated using the comparison data of the linking laboratories
    NMIJ and NRC, was less than 4%. The degrees of equivalence for the participants
    were calculated, so that results for the six non-linking laboratories may be included
    in the Key Comparison Database (KCDB).</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
