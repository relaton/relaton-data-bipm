abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>Four national standards for absorbed dose to water in<sup>60</sup>Co
    gamma radiation at the dose levels used in radiation processing have been compared
    over the range 0.1 kGy to 50 kGy using alanine dosimeters of the Office of Atoms
    for Peace (OAP) as transfer dosimeters. The comparison was piloted by the OAP
    who also participated. Two laboratories from the original six were forced to withdraw
    due to equipment problems. The results at low doses (0.1 kGy) showed a much wider
    spread (up to 17%) than at the other doses, most likely as a result of random
    variations in the alanine readout at OAP at these dose levels. Results in the
    0.1 kGy range were excluded from the analysis because the variation between the
    laboratories'' doses is overshadowed by the variation in the readout of the alanine.
    Above 1 kGy the results indicated reasonable agreement between the laboratories,
    with the majority of results within 2 % of the reference value. All of these results
    were within two combined standard uncertainties of the reference value, with the
    exception of the INER at 50 kGy point which was within three combined standard
    uncertainties. Within the stated uncertainties, the results establish the equivalence
    of the laboratories at radiation processing levels, for the range in which they
    participated: NIS (3 - 10) kGy, NIM (3 - 30) kGy, INER (3 - 50) kGy, OAP (3 -
    50) kGy.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
