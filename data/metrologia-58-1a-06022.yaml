abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group performed the APMP.RI(I)-K4
    key comparison of absorbed dose to water for<sup>60</sup>Co between 2009 and 2010.
    Fourteen standards laboratories took part in the comparison. Three commercial
    cavity ionization chambers were used as transfer instruments and circulated among
    the participants. Nearly all the measured calibration coefficients for each ionization
    chamber were within one standard uncertainty (as estimated by the laboratory)
    of the comparison mean for that chamber, indicating reasonable agreement amongst
    the participants. Three participants (ARPANSA, PTB and NMIJ) were used to link
    the results to the BIPM through the ongoing bilateral BIPM.RI(I)-K4 comparison.
    Through this link the degree of equivalence (the ratio to the BIPM Key Comparison
    Reference Value and its uncertainty) was calculated for each non-linking laboratory
    to show the calibration capabilities. For the 9 eligible participants, this degree
    of equivalent ratio fell within 3.3 parts in 103 of unity, well within the combined
    standard uncertainty in all cases.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
