    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A new key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the NMIJ and the BIPM in mammography x ray beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the expanded uncertainty of 7.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
