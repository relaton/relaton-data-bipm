abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the NMIJ and the BIPM in mammography x ray beams. The results show the standards
    to be in agreement at the level of the expanded uncertainty of 7.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>.
    The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence for
    entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
