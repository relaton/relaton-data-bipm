    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The Regional Metrology Organization AFRIMETS Technical Committee in Mass and related Quantities (TCM) Working Group Force (WGF) met in July 2018 in Enugu Nigeria during the 12th General Assembly (GA) and made a decision to carry out an AFRIMETS supplementary comparison for the unit of force. This comparison, named the AFRIMETS.M. F-S2 supplementary comparison, in the force range of 250 kN and 500 kN. This comparison was planned to demonstrate the degree of equivalence between the national standards of force and to provide evidence for the Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMCs) claimed by the participating National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) in the AFRIMETS region, and particularly the who did not participate in the global CCM.F-K2 KC. The AFRIMETS TCM approved that KEBS of Kenya to serve as the pilot laboratory. and PTB of Germany to would be link laboratories. Although not part of the AFRIMETS region, PTB from EURAMET was invited to participate and provided the reference values while NMISA provided the transfer standards used during the comparison.</p>
