abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The Regional Metrology Organization AFRIMETS Technical Committee
    in Mass and related Quantities (TCM) Working Group Force (WGF) met in July 2018
    in Enugu Nigeria during the 12th General Assembly (GA) and made a decision to
    carry out an AFRIMETS supplementary comparison for the unit of force. This comparison,
    named the AFRIMETS.M. F-S2 supplementary comparison, in the force range of 250
    kN and 500 kN. This comparison was planned to demonstrate the degree of equivalence
    between the national standards of force and to provide evidence for the Calibration
    and Measurement Capability (CMCs) claimed by the participating National Metrology
    Institutes (NMIs) in the AFRIMETS region, and particularly the who did not participate
    in the global CCM.F-K2 KC. The AFRIMETS TCM approved that KEBS of Kenya to serve
    as the pilot laboratory. and PTB of Germany to would be link laboratories. Although
    not part of the AFRIMETS region, PTB from EURAMET was invited to participate and
    provided the reference values while NMISA provided the transfer standards used
    during the comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
