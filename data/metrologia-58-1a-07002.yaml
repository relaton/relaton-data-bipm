abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report describes the method and results of a bilateral
    EURAMET Key Comparison in Vickers hardness scales of two National Metrology Institutes
    (NMIs) of Italy and Turkey, INRiM and UME, respectively. The Pilot Laboratory
    (PL) is INRiM in the comparison in which one set of hardness reference blocks
    with three hardness levels for the Vickers Hardness scales of both HV1 and HV30
    was used. The comparison was realized as planned in the Technical Protocol with
    some delay. The aim of this comparison is to link the UME measurement results
    to the CCM.H-K1.b.c through the PL (INRiM) as a participant of the CCM key comparison.
    The measurement results and uncertainty assessments declared by INRiM and UME
    are in consistency with each other and UME results are also in consistency with
    the CCM.H-K1.b.c Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs). The CCM.H-K1.b.c was
    realized during 2001 to 2003 to investigate the metrological equivalence of national
    standards among national metrology institutes (NMIs) within the CCM.</p><p>To

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
