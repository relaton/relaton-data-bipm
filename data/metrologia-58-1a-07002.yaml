    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report describes the method and results of a bilateral EURAMET Key Comparison in Vickers hardness scales of two National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of Italy and Turkey, INRiM and UME, respectively. The Pilot Laboratory (PL) is INRiM in the comparison in which one set of hardness reference blocks with three hardness levels for the Vickers Hardness scales of both HV1 and HV30 was used. The comparison was realized as planned in the Technical Protocol with some delay. The aim of this comparison is to link the UME measurement results to the CCM.H-K1.b.c through the PL (INRiM) as a participant of the CCM key comparison. The measurement results and uncertainty assessments declared by INRiM and UME are in consistency with each other and UME results are also in consistency with the CCM.H-K1.b.c Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs). The CCM.H-K1.b.c was realized during 2001 to 2003 to investigate the metrological equivalence of national standards among national metrology institutes (NMIs) within the CCM.</p>
