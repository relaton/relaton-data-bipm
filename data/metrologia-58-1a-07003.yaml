    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report describes a EURAMET supplementary comparison in Brinell hardness scales of three national metrology institutes of Italy, Turkey and Germany; INRiM, UME and PTB, respectively. The pilot laboratory is INRiM in the comparison where two sets of hardness reference blocks for the Brinell Hardness scales of HBW1/30 and HBW2.5/187.5 were used. Each set of blocks consists of three hardness levels used for each of the two scales. The comparison was realized as planned in the Technical Protocol with some delay. The measurement results and uncertainty assessments declared by INRiM, UME and PTB are in consistency with each other.</p>
