abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report describes a EURAMET supplementary comparison in
    Brinell hardness scales of three national metrology institutes of Italy, Turkey
    and Germany; INRiM, UME and PTB, respectively. The pilot laboratory is INRiM in
    the comparison where two sets of hardness reference blocks for the Brinell Hardness
    scales of HBW1/30 and HBW2.5/187.5 were used. Each set of blocks consists of three
    hardness levels used for each of the two scales. The comparison was realized as
    planned in the Technical Protocol with some delay. The measurement results and
    uncertainty assessments declared by INRiM, UME and PTB are in consistency with
    each other.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
