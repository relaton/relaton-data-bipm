    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This bilateral comparison compared the magnitude of the compressive forces generated within the 500 kN machine at FSB-LIMS with the same nominal forces generated within NPL's 1.2 MN deadweight machine, in the range from 10 kN to 500 kN. The results supported FSB-LIMS's CMC of 0.05 %.</p>
