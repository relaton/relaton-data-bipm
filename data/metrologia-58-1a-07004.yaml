abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This bilateral comparison compared the magnitude of the compressive
    forces generated within the 500 kN machine at FSB-LIMS with the same nominal forces
    generated within NPL's 1.2 MN deadweight machine, in the range from 10 kN to 500
    kN. The results supported FSB-LIMS's CMC of 0.05 %.</p><p>To reach the main text
