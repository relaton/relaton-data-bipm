abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Electrolytic conductivity in aqueous solutions is a common
    electrochemical measurement technique in industry. Since it is sensitive to the
    amount content of dissolved ions in a solution, a limiting value for conductivity
    is a clear and simple quality criterium for the ionic purity of pure water, roughly
    ranging from 0.055 μS/cm to 150 μS/cm at 25 °C. International regulations are
    becoming stricter with regards to metrological traceability to guarantee compliance
    of measurement results with relevant standards. Consequently, the NMIs active
    in this area have been facing an increasing request for the calibration of respective
    conductivity sensors and for adequate CRMs over the past years. A first, regional
    comparison has been conducted in 2013/14 (EURAMET 1271). Since an increasing number
    of NMIs, also from other regions, seek providing respective services and establishing
    CMCs, EURAMET, i.e. the Sub-Committee on Electro Analysis of TC-MC, opened a follow-up
    comparison to other regions in terms of a supplementary CCQM comparison (EURAMET.QM-S12).
    The comparison has been conducted in terms of a Round Robin scheme. A conductivity
    sensor has been sent around between ten participants for calibration at four conductivity
    levels (0.055, 0.5, 5 and 50 μS/cm at 25 °C). Basically, the measured measurement
    errors of the device have been compared in terms of conductivity. Additionally,
    the cell constants calculated from the calibration results have been compared.
    Apart from very few outliers, the comparison has demonstrated good equivalence
    of the calibration capabilities.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
