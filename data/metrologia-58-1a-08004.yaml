abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM-K34.2016.1 was organized as a subsequent key comparison
    of CCQM-K34.2016 assay of potassium hydrogen phthalate to demonstrate the improved
    capability of the laboratories which did not perform well in the original CCQM-K34.2016.
    The key comparisons were organized jointly by the working groups of inorganic
    analysis and electrochemistry analysis. National Institute of Metrology P. R.
    China (NIM) acted as the coordinating laboratory, and NIM and SMU (Slovak Institute
    of Metrology) served as linking laboratories to link to the CCQM-K34.2016 key
    comparison reference value (KCRV). CENAM, NIST and VNIIFTRI registered in K34.2016.1,
    however, VNIIFTRI gave up participating in the comparison due to failure to get
    the samples through the customs clearance in Russia. All participants used constant
    current coulometry for measurement, and improved capabilities were demonstrated.</p><p>The
    scope is same as in CCQM-K34.2016. The comparison tested the capabilities and
    methods used for assay of high purity materials. Good result indicates good performance
    in assaying the purity （amount content）of solid weak acids.</p><p>To reach the
    main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which
    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
