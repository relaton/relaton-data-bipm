abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The CCQM-K152 key comparison in parallel with CCQM-P192 pilot
    comparison were organised jointly by the Inorganic Analysis (IAWG) and Electrochemical
    Analysis and Classical Chemical methods (EAWG) working groups of CCQM to test
    the abilities of the metrology institutes to measure the amount content of the
    non-metallic elements in high purity salts as well as assaying high purity salts
    to be used as primary standards.</p><p>Eight NMIs participated in the key comparison
    CCQM-K152. Ural Research Institute for Metrology (UNIIM) (since 2020 it has been
    called Affiliated Branch of D.I.Mendeleev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM-UNIIM)),
    Russian Federation, acted as the coordinating laboratory of the comparison. There
    were two measurands: the amount content of oxidants expressed as potassium iodate,
    mol/kg, and the mass fraction of iodine, kg/kg. The measurement methods used by
    participants for the amount content of oxidants expressed as potassium iodate
    were constant current coulometry and titrimetry. For the mass fraction of iodine
    results were provided by 5 NMIs, 3 of them used the direct approach (recalculation
    from coulometric or titrimetric results) and 2 NMIs implemented the indirect approach
    based on impurities assessment using combination of the instrumental methods (ion
    chromatography, ICP OES, ICP MS).</p><p>In general, good overlap of results was
    observed for both measurands. Direct and indirect approaches for purity determination
    of pure salt provide overlapping results when impurities are summarized in ionic
    form. The suitability of coulometry for assay of high purity materials was demonstrated
    again, and some possible technical problems were highlighted.</p><p>To reach the

    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
