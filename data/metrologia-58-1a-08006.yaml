abstract:
- content: Main text<p>CCQM-K143 is a key comparison that assesses participants' ability
    to prepare single element calibration solutions. Preparing calibration solutions
    properly is the cornerstone of establishing a traceability link to the International
    System of Units (SI), and therefore should be tested in order to confirm the validity
    of CCQM comparisons of more complex materials. CCQM-K143 consisted of participants
    each preparing a single copper calibration solution at 10 g/kg copper mass fraction
    and shipping 10 bottled aliquots of that solution to the coordinating laboratory,
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The masses and mass
    fraction for the prepared solutions were documented with the submitted samples.</p><p>The
    solutions prepared by all participants were measured at NIST by high performance
    inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (HP-ICP-OES). The intensity
    measurements for copper were not mapped onto values of mass fraction via calibration.
    Instead, ratios were computed between the measurements for copper and simultaneous
    measurements for manganese, the internal standard, and all subsequent data reductions,
    including the computation of the KCRV and the degrees of equivalence, were based
    on these ratios. Other than for two participants whose measurement results appeared
    to suffer from calculation or preparation errors, all unilateral degrees of equivalence
    showed that the measured values did not differ significantly from the KCRV. These
    results were confirmed by a second set of ICP-OES measurements performed by the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). CCQM-K143 showed that participants
    are capable of preparing calibration solutions starting from high purity, assayed
    copper metal. Similar steps are involved when preparing solutions for other elements,
    so it seems safe to infer that similar capabilities should prevail when preparing
    many different, single-element solutions.</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
