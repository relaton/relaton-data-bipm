abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The key comparison CCQM-K151 protein quantification: Purity-assessed
    recombinant protein contents in buffer solution using Insulin analogue was coordinated
    by Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) under the auspices
    of the Protein Analysis Working Group (PAWG) of the Consultative Committee for
    Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology (CCQM) CCQM.</p><p>Nine
    National Metrology Institutes and Designated Institutes participated. Participants
    were required to assign the mass fraction of human insulin analogue (Ins) present
    as the main component in the comparison sample for CCQM-K151.</p><p>This study
    provided the means for assessing measurement capabilities for determination of
    purity-evaluated recombinant proteins up to 10 kDa containing up to 3 disulfide
    cross-links in an aqueous calibration solution using amino acid based ID-LC-MS.
    Sample purity was confirmed by coordinating lab. Nine results were submitted.
    All results applied the LC-MS/MS method and isotope dilution mass spectrometry
    (ID-MS) method for quantification of Ins by amino acid analysis through acid hydrolysis.
    Among nine results, the Key Comparison Reference Value (KCRV) was assigned with
    six results. The assigned KCRV was the arithmetic mean of the six results, of
    3440 mg/kg with a combined standard uncertainty of 13.5 mg/kg, the k-factor for
    the estimation of the expanded uncertainty of the KCRVs was chosen as k=2.57.
    Three participants, reported lower values than the other six, requested another
    set of test materials for additional experiments to investigate source of discrepancy
    in their results, and therefore were excluded from KCRV estimation in CCQM-K151.
    Three participants progressed substantial experiments with further investigation
    into their negative-biased factor, and actively proved their measurement capability.
    The degree of equivalence (with the KCRV) and its uncertainty was calculated for
    each result. Six of the participants were able to demonstrate the ability to quantitatively
    determine purity-assessed recombinant protein in buffer solution.</p><p>To reach

    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
