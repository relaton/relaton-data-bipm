abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are toxic air pollutants that
    are mainly emitted from man-made sources such as chemical processes, automobiles,
    power plants, and refineries, building materials, and cleaning solvents. Some
    HAPs are emitted from wildfires and chemical leak. HAPs are regulated and monitored
    to protect public health and the environment because they cause severe health
    effects such as cancer, damages to the immune system, reproductive and respiratory
    health problems.</p><p>For this supplementary comparison, a multicomponent mixture
    of HAPs in nitrogen has been chosen at an amount-of-substance fraction level of
    100 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> that is closer to their emission levels from their sources.
    The supplementary comparison is designed to underpin calibration capabilities
    using HAPs gas mixtures that are prepared gravimetrically as transfer standards.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
