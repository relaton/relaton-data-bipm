    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) are toxic air pollutants that are mainly emitted from man-made sources such as chemical processes, automobiles, power plants, and refineries, building materials, and cleaning solvents. Some HAPs are emitted from wildfires and chemical leak. HAPs are regulated and monitored to protect public health and the environment because they cause severe health effects such as cancer, damages to the immune system, reproductive and respiratory health problems.</p>
    <p>For this supplementary comparison, a multicomponent mixture of HAPs in nitrogen has been chosen at an amount-of-substance fraction level of 100 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup> that is closer to their emission levels from their sources. The supplementary comparison is designed to underpin calibration capabilities using HAPs gas mixtures that are prepared gravimetrically as transfer standards.</p>
