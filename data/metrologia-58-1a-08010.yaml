abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a poisonous gas which
    can paralyze the respiratory system, quickly leading to death. It is also a flammable
    gas, which will ignite explosively when exposed to heat, open flames or oxidizers.
    For these reasons, hydrogen sulfide is classified as a hazardous material. This
    comparison is a repeat of the key comparison of the "CCQM-K41 (2005)" and it is
    intended to compare the capabilities of the preparation and value assignment of
    gas standard of hydrogen sulfide in nitrogen. The range of the nominal amount-of-substance
    fractions of the comparison standard is 10 µmol/mol. A set of hydrogen sulfide
    in nitrogen gas mixtures were prepared by gravimetry and verified with gas chromatography-atomic
    emission detector (GC-AED) against a KRISS reference cylinder. The gravimetric
    values of the amount of substance fractions were adopted as key comparison reference
    values (KCRVs). The results of 9 participants are consistent with their KCRV.
    Therefore, it is possible for this key comparison to offer a good traceability
    and a harmonization among the global distribution data of H<sub>2</sub>S.</p><p>To

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
