    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a poisonous gas which can paralyze the respiratory system, quickly leading to death. It is also a flammable gas, which will ignite explosively when exposed to heat, open flames or oxidizers. For these reasons, hydrogen sulfide is classified as a hazardous material. This comparison is a repeat of the key comparison of the "CCQM-K41 (2005)" and it is intended to compare the capabilities of the preparation and value assignment of gas standard of hydrogen sulfide in nitrogen. The range of the nominal amount-of-substance fractions of the comparison standard is 10 µmol/mol. A set of hydrogen sulfide in nitrogen gas mixtures were prepared by gravimetry and verified with gas chromatography-atomic emission detector (GC-AED) against a KRISS reference cylinder. The gravimetric values of the amount of substance fractions were adopted as key comparison reference values (KCRVs). The results of 9 participants are consistent with their KCRV. Therefore, it is possible for this key comparison to offer a good traceability and a harmonization among the global distribution data of H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
