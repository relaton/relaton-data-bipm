abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The Track A key comparison on the determination of benzo[a]pyrene
    in olive oil (CCQM-K146) organized by the CCQM was finished in 2020. This key
    comparison was related to low polarity analytes in a high fat, low protein, low
    carbohydrate food matrix and was the model system selected to align with the OAWG
    strategy for comparisons to underpin the food sector. Due to requests from the
    participants of this comparison, CCQM organized a supplementary comparison CCQM-K146.1
    for those NMIs or DIs who did not participate in CCQM-K146 or wished to improve
    their results from CCQM-K146.</p><p>5 NMIs and DIs participated in CCQM-K146.1.
    Different extraction methods and SPE cartridges were applied in the sample pre-treatment.
    HPLC-FLD, GC-MS/MS and GC-TOF MS were applied for detection by the participants.
    Certified reference materials (CRMs) were adopted or pure materials assessed in
    house to guarantee traceability to SI for the calibrants.</p><p>NIM's result for
    CCQM-K146 was equivalent with the CCQM-K146 KCRV, thus they demonstrated acceptable
    performance in determining the measurand and their result for CCQM-K146.1 was
    used as the KCRV. The KCRV and u(KCRV) values were 8.69 μg/kg and 0.18 μg/kg,
    respectively. The random effects model obtained in CCQM-K146 suggests a dark uncertainty
    term (tau) is present, and the tau of CCQM-K146 normalized to CCQM-K146.1 measurand
    level is included in the estimation of degrees of equivalence (DoE) for the participants
    in CCQM-K146.1. This helps establish a consistent expectation of performance amongst
    the two studies, even when comparing to a different anchor KCRV.</p><p>One participant
    demonstrated their capabilities for this analysis, whereas the other three were
    all deviated from the KCRV. This supplementary comparison directly illustrates
    the capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with molecular
    mass of 100 g/mol to 500 g/mol, having low polarity pKow &lt; -2, in mass fraction
    range from 0.1 μg/kg to 1000 μg/kg in a high fat, low protein, low carbohydrate
    food matrix.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved
    for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
