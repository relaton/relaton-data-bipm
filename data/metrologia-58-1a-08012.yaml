abstract:
- content: Main text<p>As part of the ongoing key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison
    has been performed between the ozone standard of Switzerland maintained by the
    Swiss Federal Office of Metrology (METAS) and the common reference standard of
    the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone amount-of-substance
    fraction range from 0 nmol/mol to 500 nmol/mol.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in
    Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
