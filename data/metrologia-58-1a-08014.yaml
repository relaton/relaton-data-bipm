abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in nitrogen was one of the
    first types of gas mixtures performed at an international key comparison. The
    comparison dates back to 1998 (CCQMK1a) [1]. Since then, many National Metrology
    Institutes (NMIs) have developed Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs)
    for these mixtures. The international comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> at ambient
    level through CCQM-K52 was compared in 2007 [2]. Recently, NMIs in the APMP region
    have focused on developing emission standards for regulating CO<sub>2</sub> released
    by various powered vehicles such as automobiles (motor cars). At the 2017 APMP
    meeting, several NMIs requested a CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> comparison to establish
    their own standards related with automotive regulation, which was to be coordinated
    by KRISS. Consequently, this comparison provides a CMC for APMP regional NMIs
    to develop CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> CMC claim.</p><p>To reach the main text

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
