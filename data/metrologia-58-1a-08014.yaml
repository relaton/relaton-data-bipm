    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in nitrogen was one of the first types of gas mixtures performed at an international key comparison. The comparison dates back to 1998 (CCQMK1a) [1]. Since then, many National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) have developed Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) for these mixtures. The international comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> at ambient level through CCQM-K52 was compared in 2007 [2]. Recently, NMIs in the APMP region have focused on developing emission standards for regulating CO<sub>2</sub> released by various powered vehicles such as automobiles (motor cars). At the 2017 APMP meeting, several NMIs requested a CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> comparison to establish their own standards related with automotive regulation, which was to be coordinated by KRISS. Consequently, this comparison provides a CMC for APMP regional NMIs to develop CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> CMC claim.</p>
