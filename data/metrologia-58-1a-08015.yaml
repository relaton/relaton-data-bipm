    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The CCQM-K148.a comparison was coordinated by the BIPM on behalf of the CCQM Organic Analysis Working Group for NMIs and DIs which provide measurement services in organic analysis under the CIPM MRA. It was undertaken as a "Track A" comparison within the OAWG strategic plan. CCQM-K148.a demonstrates capabilities for assigning the mass fraction content of a solid organic compound having moderate molecular complexity, where the compound has a molar mass in the range (75 - 500) g/mol and is non-polar (pK<sub>ow</sub> &lt; −2), when present as the primary organic component in a neat organic solid and where the mass fraction content of the primary component in the material is in excess of 950 mg/g.</p>
    <p>Participants were required to report the mass fraction of Bisphenol A present in one supplied unit of the comparison material. Participants using a mass balance method for the assignment were also required to report their assignments of the impurity components present in the material. Methods used by the seventeen participating NMIs or DIs were predominantly based on either stand-alone mass balance (summation of impurities) or qNMR approaches, or the combination of data obtained using both methods. The results obtained using thermal methods based on freezing-point depression methods were also reported by a limited number of participants. There was excellent agreement between assignments obtained using all three approaches to assign the BPA content. </p>
    <p>The assignment of the values for the mass fraction content of BPA consistent with the KCRV was achieved by most of the comparison participants with an associated relative standard uncertainty in the assigned value in the range (0.1 - 0.5)%.</p>
