abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A pilot study for the thickness measurement of HfO<sub>2</sub>
    films was performed by the Surface Analysis Working Group (SAWG) of the Consultative
    Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM). The aim of this pilot study was to ensure
    the equivalency in the measurement capability of national metrology institutes
    for the thickness measurement of HfO<sub>2</sub> films. In this pilot study, the
    thicknesses of six HfO<sub>2</sub> films with nominal thickness from 1 nm to 4
    nm were measured by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Reflectometry(XRR),
    X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (XRF), Transmission Electron Spectroscopy (TEM), Spectroscopic
    Ellipsometry (SE) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS). The reference
    thicknesses were determined by mutual calibration of a zero-offset method (Medium
    Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (MEIS) of KRISS) and a method traceable to
    the length unit (the average thicknesses of three XRR data except the thinnest
    film). These reference thicknesses are traceable to the length unit because they
    are based on the traceability of XRR. For the thickness measurement by XPS, the
    effective attenuation length of Hf 4f electrons was determined. In the cases of
    XRR and TEM, the offset values were determined from a linear fitting between the
    reference thicknesses and the individual data by XRR and TEM. The amount of substance
    of HfO<sub>2</sub>, expressed as thickness of HfO<sub>2</sub> films (in both linear
    and areal density units), was found to be a good subject for a CCQM key comparison.</p><p>To

    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM.</p>
