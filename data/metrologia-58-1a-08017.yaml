    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>At the highest metrological level, ammonia gas standards are commonly prepared gravimetrically as Primary Standard Mixtures or using a dynamic standard. This international key comparison addressed the measurement of the amount fraction ammonia in nitrogen, to support calibration and measurement services for mainly environmental applications. The nominal amount fraction was 14 μmol mol<sup>-1</sup>. The results in this Track C key comparison on the composition of biogas are generally good.</p>
