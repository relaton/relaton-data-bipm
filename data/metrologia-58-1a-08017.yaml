abstract:
- content: Main text<p>At the highest metrological level, ammonia gas standards are
    commonly prepared gravimetrically as Primary Standard Mixtures or using a dynamic
    standard. This international key comparison addressed the measurement of the amount
    fraction ammonia in nitrogen, to support calibration and measurement services
    for mainly environmental applications. The nominal amount fraction was 14 μmol
    mol<sup>-1</sup>. The results in this Track C key comparison on the composition
    of biogas are generally good.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
