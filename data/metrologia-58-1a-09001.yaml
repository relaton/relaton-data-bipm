    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The results of the ﬁfth CIPM key comparison (KC) in the area of vibration, here concerning sinusoidal acceleration, are presented.</p>
    <p>This comparison was intended to build the foundation for subsequent regional key comparisons over the extended frequency range from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. Measurement results reported by 14 participants for magnitude and phase shift of complex charge sensitivity of single ended and back-to-back accelerometers were compared. A key comparison reference value has been deﬁned for each type of artifact, and the respective Degrees of Equivalence are reported. The ﬁnal report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
