abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The results of the ﬁfth CIPM key comparison (KC) in the area
    of vibration, here concerning sinusoidal acceleration, are presented.</p><p>This
    comparison was intended to build the foundation for subsequent regional key comparisons
    over the extended frequency range from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. Measurement results reported
    by 14 participants for magnitude and phase shift of complex charge sensitivity
    of single ended and back-to-back accelerometers were compared. A key comparison
    reference value has been deﬁned for each type of artifact, and the respective
    Degrees of Equivalence are reported. The ﬁnal report has been peer-reviewed and
    approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
