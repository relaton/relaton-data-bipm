abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>High-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) is a minimally
    invasive and non-ionizing medical procedure used to combat cancers. Faithful characterization
    of HITU fields is fundamental to ensure patient safety and clinical efficiency.
    However, standardized quality assurance protocols have not yet been established
    for HITU, which is a prerequisite for the wide acceptance of HITU as a therapeutic
    modality. This review discusses the challenges in the acoustic output characterization
    of HITU and the solutions that have been proposed to overcome this issue. The
    purpose of this review is to discuss the state of art of the metrological techniques,
    and invoke new ideas to prompt further development of HITU usage and characterization
    techniques, to ensure the safe and effective usage of therapeutic ultrasound.</p>
