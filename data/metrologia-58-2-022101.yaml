abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>In our previous work (Shen et al 2020 Metrologia \n 57 025015;
    Booth et al 2019 New J. Phys. \n 21 102001), we have reported the first primary
    quantum pressure standard based on the loss rate of cold rubidium atoms from a
    magnetic trap. We have shown that this standard is self-calibrating. That is,
    the single parameter required to quantify the pressure or particle flux impinging
    on the sensor atoms, \n \n σtotv, can be determined experimentally. In this paper,
    we refine our procedure to extract the trap loss rate coefficient by expressing
    the measured trap loss rate of the rubidium atoms as a convolution of the universal
    loss rate expression from Shen et al (2020 Metrologia \n 57 025015) and Booth
    et al (2019 New J. Phys. \n 21 102001) with the energy distribution of the rubidium
    atoms in the trap. We report improved \n \n σtotv\n \n values for<sup>87</sup>Rb–X
    (X = He, Ar, Xe, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>) collision pairs.
    All are systematically higher than our previously reported values, although the
    differences are less than 2%. The calibration factor of an ionization gauge for
    nitrogen obtained using the cold atom standard, i<sub>g</sub> = 0.950 (19), agrees
    with the value obtained by NIST, i<sub>g</sub> = 0.940 (26) calibrated against
    their orifice flow standard.</p>"
