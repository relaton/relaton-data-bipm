abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper addresses the calibration of lock-in amplifiers in
    the low frequency range. A simple but effective calibration setup implemented
    at INRIM is described. This includes a stable low-voltage source, composed of
    a digital sine wave generator and a cascade of two voltage dividers, one inductive
    and one resistive. The magnitude error is the lock-in magnitude error, which can
    be determined with an uncertainty of the order of 10<sup>−4</sup> or better, that
    is, two orders of magnitude lower than the typical lock-in accuracy specification.
    The system can operate with an input voltage from 0.1 µV to 10 µV and a frequency
    from a few hertz to about 1 kHz. The performances of the calibration setup were
    evaluated at 1 µV and 10 μV at 20 Hz and 103 Hz and compared with those of another
    existing setup, implemented at METAS, through a direct comparison in the framework
    of an EURAMET research project.</p>
