abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The dimensional metrology group at the National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed an ultra-high accuracy laser micrometer
    capable of external diameter measurements with a targeted expanded uncertainty,
    U(k = 2), of less than 20 nm. This instrument is an advanced iteration of a design
    developed at NIST in the 1990s and has been continuously improved since its inception.
    This newest approach takes advantage of the lessons learned through two decades
    of operation, process control measurement data, and performance analysis. This
    approach advances the state of the art for diameter measurements within an artifact
    diameter range of 0.02 mm to 55 mm. The instrument makes use of low thermal expansion
    materials, a stable structural design, environmental control, and remote manipulation
    of the artifacts to address the most significant uncertainty sources identified
    in previous versions of the instrument. A review of the instrument development
    and components will be presented. We will outline the significant contributions
    to the operational measurement uncertainty budget for this instrument along with
    identifying the high accuracy applications that will benefit from this effort.</p>
