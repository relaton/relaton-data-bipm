    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The dimensional metrology group at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed an ultra-high accuracy laser micrometer capable of external diameter measurements with a targeted expanded uncertainty, <italic toggle="yes">U</italic>(<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2), of less than 20 nm. This instrument is an advanced iteration of a design developed at NIST in the 1990s and has been continuously improved since its inception. This newest approach takes advantage of the lessons learned through two decades of operation, process control measurement data, and performance analysis. This approach advances the state of the art for diameter measurements within an artifact diameter range of 0.02 mm to 55 mm. The instrument makes use of low thermal expansion materials, a stable structural design, environmental control, and remote manipulation of the artifacts to address the most significant uncertainty sources identified in previous versions of the instrument. A review of the instrument development and components will be presented. We will outline the significant contributions to the operational measurement uncertainty budget for this instrument along with identifying the high accuracy applications that will benefit from this effort.</p>
