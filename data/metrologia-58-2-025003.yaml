abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The spectral optical radiant power of a quantum cascade laser
    (QCL) in the (7.35–10.6) µm spectral range has been measured using a Y-shape absolute
    cryogenic radiometer (ACR). The spectral responsivity (SR) of a transfer detector
    based on an integrating-sphere-coupled mercury-cadmium-telluride (IS-MCT) photoconductive
    detector has been calibrated. The optical radiant power of the QCL can be adjusted
    and stabilized in the range of (0.035–0.6) mW. The relative uncertainty of the
    ACR-based optical radiant power measurement was evaluated to be 0.023%–0.04% (k
    = 1). The relative uncertainty of the SR calibration of the IS-MCT transfer detector
    was analyzed to be 0.097%–0.16% (k = 1). The spectral range for the SR calibration
    can be extended to cover (3–12) µm using commercially available QCLs.</p>
