abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The use of thermocouples in many present-day applications can
    often occur with little consideration as to the inherited historical burden of
    the reference functions the thermocouples must meet. For base-metal thermocouples,
    the reference functions are specified by equations relating temperature to electro-motive-force
    and not by alloy composition. Most of the common thermocouples contain at least
    one alloyed thermoelement, the bulk of which are now known to be inherently unstable
    above 200 °C. As manufacturing technologies change, along with the material feedstock
    from which thermocouples are made, modern thermocouples can frequently give measurements
    that deviate significantly from the ASTM and IEC standards. This study first reviews
    the development of the thermocouple alloys and historical conditions under which
    the reference functions were derived and contrasts this with modern thermocouple
    alloys and new testing methods. From this comparison, it is shown that users of
    modern base-metal thermocouples need to be extremely cautious when anticipating
    likely behaviour, with even short exposures to modest temperatures revealing a
    myriad of manufacturer-dependent instabilities. Minor variations in composition
    are shown to strongly influence reversible crystallographic ordering effects in
    addition to passivation behaviour at high temperatures, in some instances leading
    to catastrophic failure. It is also shown that the initial anneal state given
    by the manufacturer has a significant effect on the stability and hence, drift
    rate, with inadequate anneal leading to unnecessarily large drift rates at less
    than 200 °C. Lastly, this review looks at recent attempts to develop more-stable
    thermocouples, based on state-of-the-art techniques able to identify specific
    causes of instability in many of the historic thermocouple alloys and demonstrates
    how these new thermocouples might better serve the end user’s needs.</p>
