    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the temperature range between 0.65 K and 1 K, the international temperature scale of 1990 (ITS-90) is based on <sup>3</sup>He vapour–pressure thermometers and overlaps with the provisional low temperature scale of 2000 (PLTS-2000) defined by the melting pressure of <sup>3</sup>He. An <italic toggle="yes">indirect</italic> comparison at PTB revealed differences between the two scales of up to 1.5 mK at 0.65 K (Engert <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> 2007 Metrologia <bold>44</bold> 40–52). Stimulated by the PTB results, we have performed a <italic toggle="yes">direct</italic> comparison <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>
                   <sub>90</sub>–<italic toggle="yes">T</italic>
                   <sub>2000</sub> from 0.65 K to 1 K at LNE-CNAM. To test repeatability, the experiment was conducted twice: in 2019 and 2020. We find differences <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>
                   <sub>90</sub>–<italic toggle="yes">T</italic>
                   <sub>2000</sub> of 0.28 mK at 1 K, increasing to 1.58 mK at 0.65 K. The direct comparison, eliminates the uncertainty component due to the transfer resistance thermometer and its calibration. Except for a point near 1 K, the new results are in accordance with those obtained at PTB (differences of less than 0.22 mK), which makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the equation specified in ITS-90.</p>
