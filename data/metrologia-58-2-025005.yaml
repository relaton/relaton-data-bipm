abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In the temperature range between 0.65 K and 1 K, the international
    temperature scale of 1990 (ITS-90) is based on<sup>3</sup>He vapour–pressure thermometers
    and overlaps with the provisional low temperature scale of 2000 (PLTS-2000) defined
    by the melting pressure of<sup>3</sup>He. An indirect comparison at PTB revealed
    differences between the two scales of up to 1.5 mK at 0.65 K (Engert et al 2007
    Metrologia 44 40–52). Stimulated by the PTB results, we have performed a direct
    comparison T<sub>90</sub>–T<sub>2000</sub> from 0.65 K to 1 K at LNE-CNAM. To
    test repeatability, the experiment was conducted twice: in 2019 and 2020. We find
    differences T<sub>90</sub>–T<sub>2000</sub> of 0.28 mK at 1 K, increasing to 1.58
    mK at 0.65 K. The direct comparison, eliminates the uncertainty component due
    to the transfer resistance thermometer and its calibration. Except for a point
    near 1 K, the new results are in accordance with those obtained at PTB (differences
    of less than 0.22 mK), which makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the
    equation specified in ITS-90.</p>'
