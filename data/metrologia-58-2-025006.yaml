abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The optical lattice clock NICT-Sr1 regularly reports calibration
    measurements of the international timescale TAI. By comparing measurement results
    to the reports of eight primary frequency standards, we find the absolute frequency
    of the<sup>87</sup>Sr clock transition to be \n \n fSr=429228004229873.08276Hz,
    with a fractional uncertainty of less than 1.8 × 10<sup>−16</sup> approaching
    the systematic limits of the best realization of the SI second. Our result is
    consistent with other recent measurements and further supported by the loop closure
    over the absolute frequencies of<sup>87</sup>Sr,<sup>171</sup>Yb and direct optical
    measurements of their ratio.</p>"
