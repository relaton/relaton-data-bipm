abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The international bureau of weights and measures (BIPM) is
    the centre for governments to act in common on matters relating to metrology,
    co-ordinating the world-wide measurement system and providing capabilities for
    international measurement comparisons on a shared-cost basis. The ionizing radiation
    department maintains and develops high-precision instrumentation to enable national
    metrology institutes to demonstrate the equivalence of primary standards of radioactivity.
    The scope of this service is expanding: the ‘extended international reference
    system (ESIR)’ project aims to provide a stable instrument capable of comparing
    standards of pure beta-emitting radionuclides, complementing existing instruments
    for gamma-emitters. In 2019, the members of the ESIR project devised a liquid
    scintillation system that is capable of producing very stable reference values
    over a long timescale, using a method inspired by the ‘triple-to-double coincidence
    ratio’ (TDCR) technique. This article sets out the approach that will be used
    for evaluating uncertainties in future comparison exercises using the ESIR. The
    method adopted was based on the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement
    published by the joint committee for guides in metrology. Particular care has
    been taken in choosing the evaluation method: the response of the TDCR instrument
    cannot be linearized, so a Monte-Carlo method was implemented and a technique
    to manage correlated input data was developed. A novel sampling technique was
    used for the input multi-variate distribution of coincident count rates; this
    approach may also be relevant to primary standards realized using the TDCR technique.
    Calculation have shown that standard uncertainties of the order of 0.1 % will
    be achievable for a typical radionuclide.</p>'
