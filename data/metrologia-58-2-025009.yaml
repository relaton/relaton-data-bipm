abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The optical two-way time transfer between two widely separated
    laser ranging ground stations in common view of a space debris target can be achieved
    from diffuse laser pulse reflections. The round-trip time-of-flight measurements
    augmented by the detection and epoch timing of diffusely scattered laser light
    from the second ground station allows accurate clock comparisons, provided that
    the mean location of the point of reflection on the target structure can be recovered
    with sufficient fidelity. We have set up a target delay model that derives the
    tumbling motion of rocket bodies from a combination of laser ranging and photometric
    measurements. Combined with the simultaneously measured short arc orbit, we obtain
    the applicable in situ propagation delay for the time transfer signal between
    the two ground stations in order to establish the clock offset between them. We
    show an example where the uncertainty of this clock synchronization for a time-of-flight
    comparison already reaches 3Â ns. We point out that there is still significant
    room for improvement.</p>
