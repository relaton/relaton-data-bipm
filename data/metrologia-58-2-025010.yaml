abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Differential sampling relative to a Josephson waveform, the
    ac quantum voltmeter (ac-QVM), has been established as the most accurate method
    for measuring signals below 1 kHz with an uncertainty of 1 part in 10<sup>8</sup>
    (k = 1) for 1 V at 250 Hz. Commercial ac-QVMs provide accuracies of about 1 part
    in 10<sup>6</sup> up to frequencies of 2 kHz. Here we present a new sub-sampling
    technique to extend the frequency range of an ac-QVM up to 100 kHz. The measurement
    results at 1 V RMS amplitude agree well within 5 µV V<sup>−1</sup> (k = 1) with
    the nominal voltage values for all frequencies from 500 Hz to 100 kHz. Two different
    analogue-to-digital converters are compared, sampling techniques, error sources
    and corrections as well as detailed uncertainty estimations are discussed.</p>
