abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Making decisions that have broad societal and economic impact
    is extremely hard. This is especially true when the data upon which choices for
    future action are based are unstable or have uncertain provenance. This letter
    discusses the benefits of metrology, as the science of measurement, in providing
    data that is stable, comparable and produced using standardised methods, in enabling
    greater confidence in the decision-making process. A key part of this increased
    confidence is via providing input data with reduced uncertainty, thereby decreasing
    the uncertainty of future predictions. The application of these principles to
    the two biggest societal challenges currently, COVID-19 and climate change, is
    discussed, and similarities and differences of approaches highlighted. It is foreseen
    that the role of metrology in enabling evidence-based decision making will become
    increasingly more important in future. Formal agreements and memoranda of understanding
    between the metrology community and the relevant global technical bodies are the
    best way to improve data quality, reliability and comparability, and therefore
    the confidence with which decisions can be made. Whilst uncertainties in data
    may be driven down as technology and metrology improves, they can never be eliminated
    entirely, and we must accept some level of uncertainty in our decision making.</p>
