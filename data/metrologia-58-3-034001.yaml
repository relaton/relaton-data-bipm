abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Of paramount importance in the field of nanotechnology is the
    ability to measure reliably the properties of nanomaterials, especially their
    size. In general, just an estimate of size is not sufficient: a quantitative indication
    of the estimate’s quality in the form of an assessment of its uncertainty is necessary
    as well. For example, standard ISO/IEC 17025:2017 (general requirements for the
    competence of testing and calibration laboratories) stipulates that appropriate
    methods and procedures shall be used for laboratory activities and for the analysis
    of data, including the identification and quantification of all contributions
    to the measurement uncertainties. In order to facilitate compliance with requirements
    such as these, a procedure is proposed for assessing the uncertainty in the evaluation
    of the mean area-equivalent diameter of a nanoparticle population by scanning
    electron microscopy. We take as reference the general approach proposed in the
    guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement, which is globally seen
    as the de facto standard for the evaluation of measurement uncertainty, and as
    such, it is normally required for accreditation. Thus, the proposed approach,
    primarily intended for guidance, will hopefully be found practical, understandable
    and useful. Ideally, it should be validated, and perhaps improved, through international
    intercomparison exercises.</p>'
