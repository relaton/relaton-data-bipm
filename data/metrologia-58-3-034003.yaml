abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Measurement uncertainty is an increasingly important consideration
    in many applications demanding extreme performance levels. In the era of the internet
    of things and 5G connectivity we can learn more about device performance by utilising
    the increasing amount of data produced. These data require appropriate information
    infrastructure to facilitate continuous updating of device performance knowledge.
    This paper presents the results of a study which NPL undertook with a leading
    test and measurement device manufacturer to examine how measurement uncertainty
    propagates through the data traceability chain from national standards to end
    devices. A hierarchy of siloed calculations and heuristics did not enable a satisfactory
    metadata exchange within the dataflow to ensure an internally consistent calculation
    of measurement uncertainty. We therefore propose a novel measurement uncertainty
    network which contains a set of internally consistent measurement models, traceable
    to national standards and connected through common quantities. The network facilitates
    sharing and programmatic processing of measurement data with due regard to timeliness,
    privacy preservation and adherence to FAIR principles in measurement data exchange.
    An illustrative example of this network is presented with techniques to determine
    the best-fitting standard probability distribution for a given dataset and the
    resulting change in information content.</p>
