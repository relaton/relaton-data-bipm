abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The measurement of the angle between an interferometer’s front
    mirror and the diffracting planes is a critical aspect of the measurement of Si
    lattice parameters by combined x-ray and optical interferometry. In addition to
    being measured offline by x-ray diffraction, it was checked online by moving the
    analyser crystal transversely and observing the phase shift of the interference
    fringe. We describe the measurement procedure and give the miscut angle of the<sup>28</sup>Si
    crystal, whose lattice parameter was an essential input datum for the determination
    of the Avogadro constant in the past and which is now used in the definition of
    the kilogram, based on counting atoms. These data will benefit others that might
    wish to repeat the measurement of the lattice parameters of this unique crystal.</p>
