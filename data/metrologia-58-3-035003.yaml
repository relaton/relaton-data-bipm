    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Optical refractometry techniques enable realization of both pressure and temperature directly from properties of the gas. The NIST refractometer, a fixed length optical cavity (FLOC) has previously been evaluated for operation as pressure standard, and now in this paper, is evaluated for the feasibility of operation as a primary temperature standard as well. The challenge is that during operation, one cavity is filled with gas. Gas dynamics predicts that this will result in heating which in turn will affect the cavity temperature uniformity, impeding the ability to measure the gas temperature with sufficient accuracy to make the standard useful as a primary standard for temperature or pressure. Temperature uniformity across the refractometer must be less than 0.5 mK for measurements of the refractivity to be sufficiently accurate for the FLOC. This paper compares computer modeling to laboratory measurements, enabling us to validate the model to predict thermal behavior and to accurately determine the measurement uncertainty of the technique. The results presented in this paper show that temperature of the glass elements of the refractometer and ‘thermal-shell’ copper chamber are equivalent to within 0.5 mK after an equilibration time of 3000 s (when going from 1 kPa to 100 kPa). This finding enables measurements of the copper chamber to determine the gas temperature to within an uncertainty (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 1) of 0.5 mK. Additionally, the NIST refractometer is evaluated for feasibility of operation as temperature standard.</p>
