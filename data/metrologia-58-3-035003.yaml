abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Optical refractometry techniques enable realization of both
    pressure and temperature directly from properties of the gas. The NIST refractometer,
    a fixed length optical cavity (FLOC) has previously been evaluated for operation
    as pressure standard, and now in this paper, is evaluated for the feasibility
    of operation as a primary temperature standard as well. The challenge is that
    during operation, one cavity is filled with gas. Gas dynamics predicts that this
    will result in heating which in turn will affect the cavity temperature uniformity,
    impeding the ability to measure the gas temperature with sufficient accuracy to
    make the standard useful as a primary standard for temperature or pressure. Temperature
    uniformity across the refractometer must be less than 0.5 mK for measurements
    of the refractivity to be sufficiently accurate for the FLOC. This paper compares
    computer modeling to laboratory measurements, enabling us to validate the model
    to predict thermal behavior and to accurately determine the measurement uncertainty
    of the technique. The results presented in this paper show that temperature of
    the glass elements of the refractometer and ‘thermal-shell’ copper chamber are
    equivalent to within 0.5 mK after an equilibration time of 3000 s (when going
    from 1 kPa to 100 kPa). This finding enables measurements of the copper chamber
    to determine the gas temperature to within an uncertainty (k = 1) of 0.5 mK. Additionally,
    the NIST refractometer is evaluated for feasibility of operation as temperature
    standard.</p>
