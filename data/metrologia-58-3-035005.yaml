abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Stark shift due to blackbody radiation (BBR) is a key obstacle
    limiting the frequency uncertainty of optical lattice clocks. A well-characterized
    BBR environment is necessary to know exactly the temperature felt by the cold
    atoms. In our ytterbium clock, the lattice-trapped atoms are exposed to the thermal
    radiation of the surrounding vacuum chamber walls and optical windows. Calibrated
    platinum resistance temperature detectors are used to monitor the vacuum chamber
    temperature in real time. In order to obtain the effective temperature T<sub>eff</sub>
    in the position of the atoms, we perform finite element (FE) analysis to the thermal
    radiation of the vacuum chamber. Due to the temperature inhomogeneity existing
    in our vacuum chamber, the limited knowledge of the air convection contributes
    the largest part of the uncertainty in T<sub>eff</sub>. For our typical room temperature
    environment, T<sub>eff</sub> can be determined with an accuracy level of 160 mK,
    corresponding to a fractional frequency uncertainty of 5.3 × 10<sup>−18</sup>
    for the BBR Stark shift. Additionally, we use a simple formula to relate T<sub>eff</sub>
    to the temperatures at the monitored points, which allows us to know the value
    of T<sub>eff</sub> without using FE analysis, and thus enables the real-time correction
    to the BBR Stark shift.</p>
