abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We show that the calibration of tri-axis accelerometers based
    on the device’s intrinsic properties alleviates the uncertainty due to mounting
    misalignment in comparison to the use of the sensitivity matrix. The intrinsic
    properties of a tri-axis accelerometer are based on a (u, v, w) coordinate system
    that represent the direction of maximum sensitivities of each of the three accelerometers
    (U, V, W) and are assumed not to be perfectly orthogonal to each other. The calibration
    procedure requires rotation of the device in the gravitational field around each
    of the Cartesian coordinate (x, y, z) axes. One component in driving down the
    uncertainty of laboratory comparisons and calibration repeats relates to misalignment
    in mounting the device onto the calibration instrument. We show that the uncertainty
    of the cross-axis terms of the sensitivity matrix is a dominating factor affecting
    uncertainty down to a 0.01° misalignment at a 100 µV noise level. The misalignment
    component can be exacerbated when calibrating modern microelectromechanical systems
    (MEMS)-based accelerometers, which are typically a few millimeters in dimension.</p>
