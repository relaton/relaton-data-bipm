abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In July 2016 the Consultative Committee for Thermometry’s Non-Contact
    Thermometry Working Group formed a task group to compile a complete list of uncertainties
    for high-temperature fixed points, categorize them as well specified or not, and
    recommend areas of future research. We describe herein two paths to realizing
    T by indirect primary radiometry using high-temperature fixed-point blackbody
    cells: one in which published values for the metal–carbon eutectic material transition
    temperatures are used and the other where a set of cells has their transition
    temperatures determined directly. The uncertainty components that need to be considered
    for each path are given together with typically achievable values and how well
    those values are known. This work concentrates on Co–C, Pt–C and Re–C.</p>'
