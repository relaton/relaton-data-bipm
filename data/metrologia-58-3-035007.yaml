    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In July 2016 the Consultative Committee for Thermometry’s Non-Contact Thermometry Working Group formed a task group to compile a complete list of uncertainties for high-temperature fixed points, categorize them as well specified or not, and recommend areas of future research. We describe herein two paths to realizing <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> by indirect primary radiometry using high-temperature fixed-point blackbody cells: one in which published values for the metal–carbon eutectic material transition temperatures are used and the other where a set of cells has their transition temperatures determined directly. The uncertainty components that need to be considered for each path are given together with typically achievable values and how well those values are known. This work concentrates on Co–C, Pt–C and Re–C.</p>
