abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this study, we realized the triple point (TP) temperature
    of sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) at the National Institute of Metrology
    (NIM), China. To this end, we designed an iso-thermal and immersion type apparatus
    with an open cell with a height of 18 cm, diameter of 5 cm, and a capacity of
    approximately 275 ml. The cell was designed with four thermometer wells for the
    simultaneous temperature measurements with four standard platinum resistance thermometers
    (SPRTs). The cell is connected with two buffer tanks that allow a sufficient amount
    of SF<sub>6</sub> to surround the thermometer wells during the solidification
    and melting processes to ensure stable temperature plateaus with long durations.
    An SF<sub>6</sub> sample with a purity of 99.9997%, which is the highest purity
    currently available, was supplied and analyzed from the Korea Research Institute
    of Standards and Science. The SF<sub>6</sub> TP temperature was determined using
    four long-stem SPRTs. The melting plateaus obtained had a duration longer than
    15 h, and the TP temperature of SF<sub>6</sub> was determined to be 223.556 03(54)
    K (k = 1). These results are consistent with those of previous studies and further
    indicate that the SF<sub>6</sub> TP is a good candidate to replace mercury TP,
    which is one of the fixed points defined in the International Temperature Scale
    of 1990, for the calibration of SPRTs.</p>
