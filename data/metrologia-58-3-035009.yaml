abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The subrange inconsistency (SRI) of a large ensemble of long-stem
    standard platinum resistance thermometers (SPRTs), representative of worldwide
    production, has been investigated for all pairs of ITS-90 overlapping subranges
    between 83.8058 K and 933.473 K. The results are reported in terms of various
    statistical parameters to facilitate their comparison with the results of different
    authors, although a statistical test, applied to one specific pair of subranges,
    supported a Gaussian distribution of the results and justified the subsequent
    use of the mean and standard deviation as statistical parameters. Depending on
    the pair of overlapping subranges, the mean SRI as calculated varied from −1.23
    mK to +0.21 mK and the SRI standard deviation varied from 0.04 mK to 0.62 mK.
    These numbers generally increased with the upper temperature limit of the pair
    of subranges, especially where the lower subrange requires a point which is not
    included in the upper subrange. The contribution to SRI from the fixed-point uncertainty
    propagation (PoU) was evaluated. The results showed that, although the effect
    of PoU on SRI largely cancels out for points common to both subranges, PoU still
    amounts to 59% to 130% of the differences between overlapping pairs of subranges.
    This means that the differences as calculated are probably a substantial overestimate
    of the true SRI. It is suggested that this effect is taken into account in making
    recommendations for typical uncertainties due to non-uniqueness.</p>
