abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the<sup>87</sup>Sr optical lattice clock at NIM with
    a clock laser referenced to a 30 cm ULE cavity. Several improvements, such as
    the atomic temperature and density, the lattice laser frequency stabilization,
    the fiber noise cancellation, etc, have been made since its first evaluation in
    2015. Its systematic frequency shifts are carefully evaluated with a total relative
    uncertainty of 2.9 × 10<sup>−17</sup>. The measured absolute frequency is 429
    228 004 229 873.07(0.13) Hz with a relative uncertainty of 3.1 × 10<sup>−16</sup>,
    with reference to the ensemble of primary and secondary frequency standards published
    in the Circular T bulletin by BIPM through a satellite link.</p>
