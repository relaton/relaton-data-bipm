abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A least-squares fit of exponential functions to a measured radioactive
    decay rate curve provides an estimate of the half-life and its statistical uncertainty
    in the assumption that all deviations from the theoretical curve are purely of
    a random nature. The result may be biased and the error underestimated as soon
    as the experiment suffers instabilities that exceed the duration of individual
    measurements. Contrary to long-term systematic errors, medium-frequency cyclic
    perturbations may be observable as autocorrelated structures in the residuals.
    In this work, an empirical decomposition algorithm is used to separate medium-frequency
    effects from the random statistical component in the fit residuals, such that
    custom error propagation factors can be calculated. A theoretical study of error
    propagation is made for sine and square wave perturbations. The empirical decomposition
    method is demonstrated on a synthetic spectrum, a time series of solar neutrino
    detection rates, and two experimental decay curves of<sup>134</sup>Cs measured
    in an ionisation chamber.</p>
