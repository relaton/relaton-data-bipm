abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The component caused by the influence of impurities often dominates
    the uncertainty budgets of realisations of temperature fixed points. The Consultative
    Committee for Thermometry recommended, therefore, in section 2.1 Fixed Points:
    Influence of Impurities of the Guide to the Realization of the ITS-90 (www.bipm.org)
    two methods for estimating this component. One is based on summing up the individual
    effects of all relevant impurities. This method causes huge efforts. The second
    one requires a reliable information on the overall impurity concentration, which
    is usually not supplied by the producers of the fixed-point materials. In the
    paper, it is analysed if the determination of the residual resistance ratio r<sub>0</sub>
    can aid in getting the required information [r<sub>0</sub> means the ratio of
    the electrical resistivities ρ at a sufficiently low temperature and at 293 K,
    usually r<sub>0</sub> = ρ(4.2 K)/ρ(293 K)]. The crucial criterion is the sensitivity
    of r<sub>0</sub> for the influence of an impurity on the fixed-point temperature,
    i.e. the magnitude of the derivative dT<sub>l</sub>/dr<sub>0</sub> of the liquidus-line
    temperature T<sub>l</sub> with respect to r<sub>0</sub>. As examples, the developed
    methodology is applied to three fixed points of the ITS-90, namely the freezing
    points of indium, zinc, and aluminium. It can be shown that the use of r<sub>0</sub>
    can reduce the number of impurities, for which the effortful determination of
    the individual concentrations is necessary, by an order of magnitude, namely to
    about 10 or below.</p>'
