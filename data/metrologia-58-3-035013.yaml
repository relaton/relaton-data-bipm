    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The component caused by the influence of impurities often dominates the uncertainty budgets of realisations of temperature fixed points. The Consultative Committee for Thermometry recommended, therefore, in section 2.1 <italic toggle="yes">Fixed Points</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Influence of Impurities</italic> of the <italic toggle="yes">Guide to the Realization of the ITS-90</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bipm.org" xlink:type="simple">www.bipm.org</ext-link>) two methods for estimating this component. One is based on summing up the individual effects of all relevant impurities. This method causes huge efforts. The second one requires a reliable information on the overall impurity concentration, which is usually not supplied by the producers of the fixed-point materials. In the paper, it is analysed if the determination of the residual resistance ratio <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub> can aid in getting the required information [<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub> means the ratio of the electrical resistivities <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic> at a sufficiently low temperature and at 293 K, usually <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub> = <italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>(4.2 K)/<italic toggle="yes">ρ</italic>(293 K)]. The crucial criterion is the sensitivity of <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub> for the influence of an impurity on the fixed-point temperature, i.e. the magnitude of the derivative d<italic toggle="yes">T</italic>
                   <sub>l</sub>/d<italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub> of the liquidus-line temperature <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>
                   <sub>l</sub> with respect to <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub>. As examples, the developed methodology is applied to three fixed points of the ITS-90, namely the freezing points of indium, zinc, and aluminium. It can be shown that the use of <italic toggle="yes">r</italic>
                   <sub>0</sub> can reduce the number of impurities, for which the effortful determination of the individual concentrations is necessary, by an order of magnitude, namely to about 10 or below.</p>
