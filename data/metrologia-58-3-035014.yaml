abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>There has long been debate over how to treat dimensionless quantities,
    or quantities with the unit one, within the International System of Units (SI).
    These arguments have been brought into sharper focus because of the increasing
    application of metrological principles in areas such as chemistry, biology and
    nanoscience where counting measurements are common. This has caused debates about
    how the SI should address counting quantities and the unit one (symbol 1). This
    article reviews the types of quantities with the unit one, how these quantities
    may be expressed together with their uncertainty and how this relates to counting.
    The qualities of counting quantities are explored in more detail and the range
    of possibilities for dealing with the unit one for counting are discussed. It
    is proposed that the SI should allow only the unit one for counting, but that
    downstream of the SI there may well be benefits from standardising the use of
    more descriptive, technical area specific ‘units’ for expressing the results of
    counting. As with all measurement it is essential that a full description, in
    words, of the counting quantity being expressed accompanies the measurement result.</p>
