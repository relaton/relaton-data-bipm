abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The air piston gauge (APG) has been established at the National
    Physical Laboratory, India (NPLI) for Pascal realization since 2002. The APG at
    NPLI has been considered a transfer pressure standard because it has been calibrated
    against the primary pressure standard, i.e. ultrasonic interferometer manometer.
    As per existing international protocol, the APG establishment as a primary standard,
    the effective area (A<sub>e</sub>) of piston–cylinder (p–c) assembly and masses
    must be directly traceable to SI units. We have calculated A<sub>e</sub> and associated
    uncertainty of p–c assembly using the theory of rarefaction gas dynamics, which
    is based on dimension measurements. The value of A<sub>e</sub> is obtained for
    varying temperatures and radii of piston and cylinder in their respective uncertainty
    limits. The variation of the cylinder's inner radius within its uncertainty limit
    of 0.7 µm includes the expected effective area, i.e. 3.356 775 (5) cm<sup>2</sup>.
    The effective area’s expected values are obtained for the cylinder’s radius of
    10.338 00 (2) mm, which is approximately 0.65 µm away from the value obtained
    from dimensional measurements and well within the uncertainty limit. Therefore,
    to get the effective area of 3.356 775 (5) cm<sup>2</sup>, the uncertainty of
    the cylinder’s radius should be at least one order less (similar to piston’s radius)
    than that of the present value. The precision in dimension measurement of the
    cylinder's internal radius is the critical parameter for effective area calculation
    of p–c assembly.</p>
