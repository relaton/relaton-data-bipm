abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Blackbody radiation (BBR) temperature and its uncertainty mainly
    contribute to the BBR shift uncertainty, which is one of the challenges in most
    ion optical clocks. Here, an improved BBR temperature evaluation method based
    on the analysis of the effective solid angle of an ion trapping system using the
    finite element method is presented. To effectively suppress the BBR temperature
    uncertainty, the structure of an ion trap was optimized to reduce the effective
    solid angle of the insulating supports, and a BBR shield was employed to reduce
    the influence of the surrounding BBR in the newly developed ion trap system. Due
    to radiofrequency field, it is difficult to evaluate the temperature of BBR shield
    accurately using contact-temperature-sensors inside the vacuum chamber. We used
    a well shielded platinum resistance temperature sensor to measure the temperature
    of the shield from the outside of the vacuum chamber. Through a detailed evaluation,
    the BBR temperature uncertainty of this newly designed system is 0.17 K, corresponding
    to a BBR frequency shift uncertainty of 2 × 10<sup>−18</sup> for the<sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>+</sup>
    optical clock. This improvement of the BBR temperature uncertainty using the active
    adjustment of the distribution of the effective solid angle of the ion trapping
    system, without a complicated cryogenic trap, is very suitable for transportable
    optical clocks operating at room temperature (∼295 K).</p>
