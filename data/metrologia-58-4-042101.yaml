abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>This short note is a supplement to the paper ‘Primary thermometry
    from 2.5 K to 140 K applying dielectric-constant gas thermometry’ (2017 Metrologia
    \n 54 141–7). It deals with thermodynamic temperature measurements at the boiling
    point of the heavy isotope of helium (<sup>4</sup>He, 4 K) and the triple points
    of hydrogen (14 K) and neon (25 K). This is of special interest because recent
    data published in this temperature range have an unexpectedly large spread. The
    results presented in this short note show that the International Temperature Scale
    of 1990, ITS-90, is thermodynamically correct at 4 K and 14 K, but too high by
    about half a millikelvin at 25 K. Furthermore, care is given to two aspects of
    dielectric-constant gas thermometry in the low-temperature range. First, dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry can be applied for practical primary thermometry. The measurement
    of only one isotherm in one day yields a temperature value with an uncertainty
    order of a few tenths of a millikelvin. Second, the use of recent ab initio values
    for the virial coefficients of helium as a measuring gas can reduce the efforts
    significantly. Even one data pair of pressure and dielectric constant can yield
    a thermodynamic temperature value of uncertainty less than a factor of two larger
    compared to the uncertainty of the usually used fit evaluation. For 4 K and 25 K,
    the achieved final uncertainty for T is still larger than the realization uncertainty
    of T<sub>90</sub>. Thereby in the case of 14 K, both uncertainties are comparable.</p>"
