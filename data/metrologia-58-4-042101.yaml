  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>This short note is a supplement to the paper
    ‘Primary thermometry from 2.5 K to 140 K applying dielectric-constant gas thermometry’
    (2017 <italic toggle=\"yes\">Metrologia</italic> \n               <bold>54</bold>
    141–7). It deals with thermodynamic temperature measurements at the boiling point
    of the heavy isotope of helium (<sup>4</sup>He, 4 K) and the triple points of
    hydrogen (14 K) and neon (25 K). This is of special interest because recent data
    published in this temperature range have an unexpectedly large spread. The results
    presented in this short note show that the International Temperature Scale of
    1990, ITS-90, is thermodynamically correct at 4 K and 14 K, but too high by about
    half a millikelvin at 25 K. Furthermore, care is given to two aspects of dielectric-constant
    gas thermometry in the low-temperature range. First, dielectric-constant gas thermometry
    can be applied for practical primary thermometry. The measurement of only one
    isotherm in one day yields a temperature value with an uncertainty order of a
    few tenths of a millikelvin. Second, the use of recent <italic toggle=\"yes\">ab
    initio</italic> values for the virial coefficients of helium as a measuring gas
    can reduce the efforts significantly. Even one data pair of pressure and dielectric
    constant can yield a thermodynamic temperature value of uncertainty less than
    a factor of two larger compared to the uncertainty of the usually used fit evaluation.
    For 4 K and 25 K, the achieved final uncertainty for <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>
    is still larger than the realization uncertainty of <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n
    \              <sub>90</sub>. Thereby in the case of 14 K, both uncertainties
    are comparable.</p>"
