abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The main motivation for this research is the growing awareness
    of the impact of climate change and the increasing relevance of the United Nations
    Sustainable Development Goals, aiming to contribute to the measurement of quantities
    like precipitation and rate of rainfall. This knowledge is widely used in hydrology,
    climatology and meteorology, providing data and information applied in modelling,
    pattern definition and recognition, and forecasting. This work is concerned with
    estimating the average areal rainfall in a stipulated region from rainfall intensity
    observations made at measurement stations within that region. It focuses on three
    straightforward estimation approaches: the arithmetic mean method, the Thiessen
    polygon method and the isohyetal method. The evaluation of the associated measurement
    uncertainty, for which the law of propagation of uncertainty and a Monte Carlo
    method as described in guidance documents from the Joint Committee for Guides
    in Metrology are applied, is the main consideration. The approaches described
    may be readily applied by practitioners. A comparison of results from applying
    these methods to a simple example is made. Such results are required for conformity
    assessment and support in urban management and water resources management worldwide.</p>'
