abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The coherent population trapping (CPT) atomic clock is very
    promising for use in next-generation spaceborne applications owing to its compactness
    and high performance. In this paper, we propose and implement a CPT atomic clock
    based on the direct modulation of a large-modulation-bandwidth and narrow-linewidth
    distributed Bragg reflector laser, which replaces the usually used external bulk
    modulator in high-performance CPT clocks. Our method retains the high performance
    while significantly reducing the clock size. Using this highly compact bichromatic
    light source and simplest CPT configuration, in which a circularly polarized bichromatic
    laser interrogates the<sup>87</sup>Rb atom system, a CPT signal of clock transition
    with a narrow linewidth and high contrast is observed. We then lock the local
    oscillator frequency to the CPT resonance and demonstrate an encouraging short-term
    frequency stability of 3.6 × 10<sup>−13</sup> \n τ<sup>−1/2</sup> (4 s ⩽ τ ⩽ 200 s).
    We attribute it to the ultralow laser frequency and intensity noise as well as
    to the high-quality-factor CPT signal. This study can pave the way for the development
    of compact high-performance CPT clocks based on our scheme.</p>"
