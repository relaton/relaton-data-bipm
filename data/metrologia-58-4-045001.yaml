  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>The coherent population trapping (CPT) atomic
    clock is very promising for use in next-generation spaceborne applications owing
    to its compactness and high performance. In this paper, we propose and implement
    a CPT atomic clock based on the direct modulation of a large-modulation-bandwidth
    and narrow-linewidth distributed Bragg reflector laser, which replaces the usually
    used external bulk modulator in high-performance CPT clocks. Our method retains
    the high performance while significantly reducing the clock size. Using this highly
    compact bichromatic light source and simplest CPT configuration, in which a circularly
    polarized bichromatic laser interrogates the <sup>87</sup>Rb atom system, a CPT
    signal of clock transition with a narrow linewidth and high contrast is observed.
    We then lock the local oscillator frequency to the CPT resonance and demonstrate
    an encouraging short-term frequency stability of 3.6 × 10<sup>−13</sup> \n               <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">τ</italic>\n               <sup>−1/2</sup> (4 s ⩽ <italic toggle=\"yes\">τ</italic>
    ⩽ 200 s). We attribute it to the ultralow laser frequency and intensity noise
    as well as to the high-quality-factor CPT signal. This study can pave the way
    for the development of compact high-performance CPT clocks based on our scheme.</p>"
