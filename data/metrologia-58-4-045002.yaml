    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Accelerometers with a digital signal output are widely used for the motion sensing of internet of things devices, vibration monitoring in industries, or scientific observations. Calibrating their frequency response is essential in extracting the correct information from measurements. However, the dynamic calibration method of a digital sensor has not yet been established. This study develops a simple synchronized data acquisition system for digital and analog signals and implements it in the primary calibration system of accelerometers. Using the constructed system, response of a digital accelerometer, including both sensitivity modulus and phase shift, is accurately determined. The measurement uncertainty was evaluated in detail, and the estimated values for the sensitivity modulus and the phase shift were below 0.2% and 0.1Â°, respectively. The uncertainty source component specific to the digital signal acquisition system was negligible compared to the total uncertainty.</p>
