    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Light-emitting diode (LED) standard lamps are interesting since the traditional incandescent standard lamps for photometry are difficult to obtain. Many of the National Metrology Institutes have started projects to study the use of LED standards for photometric comparison. The National Institute of Metrology, China, has developed a type of LED filament lamp for total luminous flux. The lamp mimics the 4<italic toggle="yes">π</italic> incandescent standard lamp and has no space for an active temperature control component. A temperature dependence correction method is reported using the coefficient of the lamp voltage to the output luminous flux. The luminous flux correction is derived from the lamp voltage value. By applying correction, the stability test of the LED filament lamp shows that the ageing effect was estimated to be less than 0.1%/210 days. The temperature dependence was suppressed to less than 0.1% for a range of 21 °C ± 2 °C, which could be due to possible temperature fluctuations of the lamp ambient temperature during measurement by the goniophotometer or integrating sphere.</p>
