abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The GAWG (Gas Analysis Working Group of the Consultative Committee
    for Amount of Substance: Metrology in Chemistry and Biology) has developed an
    extrapolation scheme to transfer so that the expanded uncertainty as reported
    in a key comparison to other amount fractions. Typically, such a comparison only
    addresses one amount fraction level, whereas the relevant service of a national
    metrology institute usually covers an interval. In this work, we show how, based
    on empirical evidence and the uncertainty reported in a key comparison, the measurement
    uncertainty can be predicted over a wide interval. We do so for four components:
    carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, propane and methane, and for two matrices, nitrogen
    and air. The empirical results confirm to a large extent the validity of the extrapolation
    scheme of the GAWG above 10 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. At the same time, our results
    show that predictions at the ends of the intervals are often providing a conservative
    value for the expanded uncertainty. We also conclude that the GAWG extrapolation
    scheme is less suited for CMCs where additional effects (e.g., adsorptivity, reactivity)
    play a role. Our extrapolation scheme is more flexible and better suited for this
    purpose. We also note that the GAWG does not perform well if the nominal value
    of the amount fraction in the key comparison is substantially below 10 µmol mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p>'
