abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We used absolute primary acoustic gas thermometry (AGT) to
    calibrate a Pt–Co resistance thermometer on the thermodynamic temperature scale
    by measuring the speed of sound in helium at a temperature T* chosen to be near
    the temperature of the triple point of neon, T<sub>Ne</sub>. Prior to the present
    AGT, the Pt–Co thermometer was used with a neon triple-point cell as part of an
    interlaboratory comparison. Taken together, the results of the interlaboratory
    comparison and the present AGT redetermined the thermodynamic temperature T<sub>Ne</sub>
    = (24.555 15 ± 0.000 24) K. This new value of T<sub>Ne</sub> is consistent with
    other recent determinations obtained with various primary methods. After completing
    the AGT thermodynamic calibration, we used the Pt–Co thermometer to link T* to
    the temperature ratios measured by single-pressure refractive-index gas thermometry
    (SPRIGT) in a different laboratory. (Gao et al 2020 Metrologia \n 57 065006) Now,
    the T*-linked SPRIGT system can calibrate other thermometers on the thermodynamic
    temperature scale T in the range 5 K ⩽ T ⩽ T<sub>Ne</sub> without using the international
    temperature scale ITS-90. At most temperatures in this range, the uncertainties
    of the T*-linked SPRIGT system are smaller than those of the ITS-90 systems used
    by National Metrology Institutes to calibrate resistance thermometers.</p>"
