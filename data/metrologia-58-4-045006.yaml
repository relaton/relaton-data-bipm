  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>We used absolute primary acoustic gas thermometry
    (AGT) to calibrate a Pt–Co resistance thermometer on the thermodynamic temperature
    scale by measuring the speed of sound in helium at a temperature <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>*
    chosen to be near the temperature of the triple point of neon, <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n
    \              <sub>Ne</sub>. Prior to the present AGT, the Pt–Co thermometer
    was used with a neon triple-point cell as part of an interlaboratory comparison.
    Taken together, the results of the interlaboratory comparison and the present
    AGT redetermined the thermodynamic temperature <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n
    \              <sub>Ne</sub> = (24.555 15 ± 0.000 24) K. This new value of <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n               <sub>Ne</sub> is consistent with other
    recent determinations obtained with various primary methods. After completing
    the AGT thermodynamic calibration, we used the Pt–Co thermometer to link <italic
    toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>* to the temperature ratios measured by single-pressure
    refractive-index gas thermometry (SPRIGT) in a different laboratory. (Gao <italic

    \n               <bold>57</bold> 065006) Now, the <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>*-linked
    SPRIGT system can calibrate other thermometers on the thermodynamic temperature
    scale <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic> in the range 5 K ⩽ <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>
    ⩽ <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>\n               <sub>Ne</sub> without using
    the international temperature scale ITS-90. At most temperatures in this range,
    the uncertainties of the <italic toggle=\"yes\">T</italic>*-linked SPRIGT system
    are smaller than those of the ITS-90 systems used by National Metrology Institutes
    to calibrate resistance thermometers.</p>"
