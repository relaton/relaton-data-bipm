    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>NIST calibrates anemometers as a function of airspeed vector and turbulence intensity (<italic toggle="yes">Tu</italic>). The vector capability (sometimes called ‘3D’) is particularly important for calibrating multi-hole differential-pressure probes that are often used to quantify pollution emitted by smokestacks of coal-burning electric power plants. Starting with a conventional ‘1D’ wind tunnel, we achieved vector and <italic toggle="yes">Tu</italic> capabilities by installing translation/rotation stages and removable turbulence generators (grids or flags). The calibration ranges are: yaw angle ±180°; pitch angle ±45°; airspeed 1 m s<sup>−1</sup> to 30 m s<sup>−1</sup>; turbulence intensity 0.07 ⩽ <italic toggle="yes">Tu</italic> ⩽ 0.25; average data collection rate: 300 points/h at fixed <italic toggle="yes">Tu</italic>. The system’s expanded uncertainties corresponding to 95% confidence level are: airspeed 0.0045 × |<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>| + (0.036/|<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>|)<sup>2</sup> where |<italic toggle="yes">V</italic>| is the magnitude of the airspeed in m s<sup>−1</sup>; pitch and yaw angles 0.3°; and turbulence intensity 0.03 <italic toggle="yes">Tu</italic>. The airspeed working standard is a laser Doppler anemometer that is traced to SI unit of velocity via a spinning disk. Calibrations are corrected for blockage by the instrument under test and its supports.</p>
