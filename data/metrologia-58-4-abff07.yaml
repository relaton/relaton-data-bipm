abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The primary measurement standard for the number concentration
    of liquid-borne particles adopted by the National Metrology Institute of Japan
    was upgraded to cover particle diameters in the range of 600 nm–10 µm. The main
    aim was to report the extension of the lower limit of the measurement range in
    particle diameters from 2 µm to 600 nm, and the reduction of the measurement uncertainty
    inherent in the previous method using the total-counting-type flow cytometric
    technique. To extend the measurement range, we adopted a mass-measurement-type
    optical particle counting method, which consisted of a pair of optical particle
    counters with a pulse height analyzer, an electronic balance, and a syringe sampler.
    The relative expanded uncertainties with a coverage factor of k = 2 for the 600 nm
    and 10 µm suspension measurements were 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively. The validity
    of the results was confirmed in both cases via comparison with the results obtained
    using an independent microscopic counting method. With the change in the measurement
    method, a reduction of the uncertainty was accomplished: e.g., from a 4.4% to
    a 3.5% relative expanded uncertainty (k = 2) for a 10 µm polystyrene latex particle
    suspension.</p>'
