abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Accelerometers with a digital signal output are widely used
    for the motion sensing of internet of things devices, vibration monitoring in
    industries, or scientific observations. Calibrating their frequency response is
    essential in extracting the correct information from measurements. However, the
    dynamic calibration method of a digital sensor has not yet been established. This
    study develops a simple synchronized data acquisition system for digital and analog
    signals and implements it in the primary calibration system of accelerometers.
    Using the constructed system, response of a digital accelerometer, including both
    sensitivity modulus and phase shift, is accurately determined. The measurement
    uncertainty was evaluated in detail, and the estimated values for the sensitivity
    modulus and the phase shift were below 0.2% and 0.1Â°, respectively. The uncertainty
    source component specific to the digital signal acquisition system was negligible
    compared to the total uncertainty.</p>
