abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>NIST calibrates anemometers as a function of airspeed vector
    and turbulence intensity (Tu). The vector capability (sometimes called ‘3D’) is
    particularly important for calibrating multi-hole differential-pressure probes
    that are often used to quantify pollution emitted by smokestacks of coal-burning
    electric power plants. Starting with a conventional ‘1D’ wind tunnel, we achieved
    vector and Tu capabilities by installing translation/rotation stages and removable
    turbulence generators (grids or flags). The calibration ranges are: yaw angle
    ±180°; pitch angle ±45°; airspeed 1 m s<sup>−1</sup> to 30 m s<sup>−1</sup>; turbulence
    intensity 0.07 ⩽ Tu ⩽ 0.25; average data collection rate: 300 points/h at fixed
    Tu. The system’s expanded uncertainties corresponding to 95% confidence level
    are: airspeed 0.0045 × |V| + (0.036/|V|)<sup>2</sup> where |V| is the magnitude
    of the airspeed in m s<sup>−1</sup>; pitch and yaw angles 0.3°; and turbulence
    intensity 0.03 Tu. The airspeed working standard is a laser Doppler anemometer
    that is traced to SI unit of velocity via a spinning disk. Calibrations are corrected
    for blockage by the instrument under test and its supports.</p>'
