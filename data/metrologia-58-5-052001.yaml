  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>Because of continued confusion caused by the
    SI’s interpretation of angle and solid angle as dimensionless quantities (and
    the radian and steradian as dimensionless derived units), it is time for the SI
    to treat these dimensional physical quantities correctly. Building on previous
    authors’ foundations, starting from Euclid’s <italic toggle=\"yes\">Elements</italic>,
    I argue that angle should be recognized as a base quantity with an independent
    dimension: angle, <sans-serif>A</sans-serif>. A dimensionally consistent analysis
    of rotational geometry and mechanics results in the appearance of a constant of
    Nature equal to the central angle of a plane circular sector whose arc length
    is equal to that of its radius. This is the common (but not current SI) concept
    of the radian, rad, appropriately chosen as the base unit for angle. What the
    SI calls ‘angle’ is actually a nondimensionalized angle: the physical angle (dimension
    <sans-serif>A</sans-serif>) divided by one radian. Using a coordinate-system-independent
    definition of solid angle, I show that this is a derived quantity with dimension
    <sans-serif>A</sans-serif>\n\t\t\t\t\t          <sup>2</sup> and appropriate unit
    radian-squared. The steradian is retained as a coherent derived unit: sr = rad<sup>2</sup>.
    Clarification of terminology is needed in distinguishing between ‘geometrical’
    and ‘mathematical’ trigonometric functions and in related topics, including the
    distinction between frequency and angular velocity, and between phase and phase
    angle, among other things.</p>"
