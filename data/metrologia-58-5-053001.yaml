    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Currently, in the International System of Units (SI), reciprocal second (s<sup>−1</sup>) and radian per second (rad s<sup>−1</sup>) are the units of frequency <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> and angular frequency <italic toggle="yes">ω</italic>, respectively. At the same time, these quantities are related in the SI by the simple mathematical relationship <italic toggle="yes">ω</italic> = 2<italic toggle="yes">πν</italic>. And here an evident conflict between this relation and the dimensions of the quantities included in it arises. When using the units in question, the two sides of this relation have different dimensions, which is not admissible in either physics or metrology. However, this situation has existed in metrology for many years. In 2019, the angular frequency with unit rad s<sup>−1</sup> was included in the SI brochure. This article analyzes the reasons that have led to this conflict and establishes the relationship between frequency, angular frequency and angular velocity. An example of a simple oscillatory system shows that <italic toggle="yes">ω</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ν</italic> have the same dimension, inverse to the dimension of the time. Therefore, they are measured by the same unit s<sup>−1</sup>. This does not coincide with the current definition of the unit of angular frequency in the SI, but fully corresponds to the laws of physics and removes the contradiction in the relation <italic toggle="yes">ω</italic> = 2<italic toggle="yes">πν</italic>. It is also shown that the angular frequency and angular velocity are independent quantities of different dimensions.</p>
