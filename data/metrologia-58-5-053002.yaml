abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>A recent letter [] proposed changing the dimensionless status
    of the radian and steradian within the SI, while allowing the continued use of
    the convention to set the angle 1 radian equal to the number 1 within equations,
    providing this is done explicitly. This would bring the advantages of a physics-based,
    consistent, and logically-robust unit system, with unambiguous units for all physical
    quantities, for the first time, while any upheaval to familiar equations and routine
    practice would be minimised. More details of this proposal are given here. The
    only notable changes for typical end-users would be: improved units for the quantities
    torque, angular momentum and moment of inertia; a statement of the convention
    accompanying some familiar equations; and the use of different symbols for ℏ the
    action and ℏ the angular momentum, a small step forward for quantum physics. Some
    features of the proposal are already established practice for quantities involving
    the steradian such as radiant intensity and radiance.</p>'
