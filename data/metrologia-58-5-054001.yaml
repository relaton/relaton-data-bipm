abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The Newtonian gravitational constant G has proved to be one
    of the most difficult constants to measure in physics. The improvement of measuring
    G with the atomic interferometry method is significantly limited by the positioning
    accuracy of the atom clouds and source masses, and the measurement accuracy of
    the atomic velocity. In this article, we propose an idea for designing the source
    masses to determine G with atom interferometry, in which a nearly uniform gravitational
    field in the motion region of the atom clouds is constructed. This design can
    greatly reduce the influence of the uncertainty of the atomic initial position
    and velocity on the precision of G measurement, since these atomic initial conditions
    affect the interferometer phase shift by coupling themselves with the gravitational
    gradient. Finally, we present a scheme for measuring G with a relative standard
    uncertainty of 27 parts per million.</p>
