abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have developed a broadband and high-precision terahertz (THz)
    frequency counter based on a semiconductor-superlattice harmonic mixer (SLHM).
    Comparison of two THz frequencies determined using two independent counters and
    direct measurement of frequency-stabilized THz-quantum cascade lasers by a single
    counter showed a measurement uncertainty of less than 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> over
    a four-octave range from 120 GHz to 2.8 THz. Further extension of this measurable
    range was indicated by the research regarding the higher-harmonics generation
    of a local oscillator for the SLHM. This compact and easy-to-handle THz counter
    operating at room temperature is available for high-resolution spectroscopy of
    ultracold molecules proposed for detecting temporal changes in physics constants
    as well as many THz applications requiring a wide measurement range without a
    bulky cryogenic apparatus.</p>
