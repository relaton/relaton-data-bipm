    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We have developed a broadband and high-precision terahertz (THz) frequency counter based on a semiconductor-superlattice harmonic mixer (SLHM). Comparison of two THz frequencies determined using two independent counters and direct measurement of frequency-stabilized THz-quantum cascade lasers by a single counter showed a measurement uncertainty of less than 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> over a four-octave range from 120 GHz to 2.8 THz. Further extension of this measurable range was indicated by the research regarding the higher-harmonics generation of a local oscillator for the SLHM. This compact and easy-to-handle THz counter operating at room temperature is available for high-resolution spectroscopy of ultracold molecules proposed for detecting temporal changes in physics constants as well as many THz applications requiring a wide measurement range without a bulky cryogenic apparatus.</p>
