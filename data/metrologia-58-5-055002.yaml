abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Determining the degree of equivalence of participating laboratories
    from the results of measurement comparisons still prompts discussions among metrologists,
    especially where measurement uncertainties have been underestimated. This paper
    expands on a solution to a problem issued in 2020 by the Journal of Analytical
    and Bioanalytical Chemistry. The example illustrates an approach to consensus-building
    based on Bayesian selection among statistical models that attempt to explain the
    excess of data variation. The probability of any further model being correct can
    be similarly calculated.</p>
