    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Determining the degree of equivalence of participating laboratories from the results of measurement comparisons still prompts discussions among metrologists, especially where measurement uncertainties have been underestimated. This paper expands on a solution to a problem issued in 2020 by the <italic toggle="yes">Journal of Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry</italic>. The example illustrates an approach to consensus-building based on Bayesian selection among statistical models that attempt to explain the excess of data variation. The probability of any further model being correct can be similarly calculated.</p>
