abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) underpins
    much of modern thermometry, yet efforts to comprehensively characterize and improve
    its reproducibility have been limited. Here, a low-uncertainty data set drawn
    from 13 standard platinum resistance thermometers is used to quantify all three
    main manifestations of scale irreproducibility over the range 13.8033 K to 273.16 K.
    Four overlapping ITS-90 subranges are investigated, along with three prospective
    approaches to temperature scale improvement. The current version of the Guide
    to the Realization of the ITS-90 is found to overestimate scale realization uncertainties,
    and recommendations are made to revise the guidance provided therein. Replacing
    the ITS-90 deviation function of subrange 3 with a new version further improves
    the interpolation quality of this subrange by a factor of two, and calibrating
    thermometers at the triple point of xenon rather than the triple point of mercury
    cuts the realization uncertainty of subrange 4 in half. New linear subranges spanning
    from the triple point of water to the triple points of mercury or xenon could
    be added to the scale without compromising the performance of the existing subranges.
    Combining new interpolation equations with calibration at the triple point of
    xenon provides the basis for a much more reproducible temperature scale than the
    ITS-90, with magnification of fixed point uncertainties nearly eliminated for
    all of subranges 1–4 above the triple point of oxygen.</p>
