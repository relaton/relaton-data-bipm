    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Optomechanical accelerometers offer <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> traceability to the international system of units through laser interferometry, providing an alternative to a calibration chain using instrumented shakers. Here, we examine the ‘self-calibrating’ property of a prototype optomechanical accelerometer for use as a seismic reference. We report the optomechanically derived sensitivity of the accelerometer and compare this <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> calibrated output to input accelerations from an instrumented shaker, finding agreement to be within ±1%. The comparison spanned frequencies between 3 Hz and 30 Hz, and for sinusoidal accelerations with amplitudes ranging from 0.01 m s<sup>−2</sup> to 0.6 m s<sup>−2</sup>. These results are evidence that optomechanically derived sensitivity calibration can be equivalent to established international methods for primary calibration.</p>
