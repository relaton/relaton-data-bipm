abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Optomechanical accelerometers offer in situ traceability to
    the international system of units through laser interferometry, providing an alternative
    to a calibration chain using instrumented shakers. Here, we examine the ‘self-calibrating’
    property of a prototype optomechanical accelerometer for use as a seismic reference.
    We report the optomechanically derived sensitivity of the accelerometer and compare
    this in situ calibrated output to input accelerations from an instrumented shaker,
    finding agreement to be within ±1%. The comparison spanned frequencies between
    3 Hz and 30 Hz, and for sinusoidal accelerations with amplitudes ranging from
    0.01 m s<sup>−2</sup> to 0.6 m s<sup>−2</sup>. These results are evidence that
    optomechanically derived sensitivity calibration can be equivalent to established
    international methods for primary calibration.</p>
