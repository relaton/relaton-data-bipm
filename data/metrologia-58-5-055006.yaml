    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Condensation particle counters (CPCs) are widely used for the measurement of aerosol particle number concentrations in the size range from approximately 3 nm to 3 µm. For an SI-traceable calibration of the size-dependent counting efficiency, which is advisable on a regular basis and required in several applications, Faraday cup aerosol electrometers (FCAEs) are considered to be a suitable SI-traceable reference. While the volumetric aerosol inlet flowrate and the electrical current measurement in FCAEs can be related to respective SI references, inter-comparison exercises for FCAEs are still performed on a regular basis to establish reliable uncertainty budgets and to further investigate the influences of designs and operational parameters on comparability. This is strongly demanded in the international community of metrological institutes and aerosol calibration facilities around the world, which provide CPC calibrations. In the present study, the performance of FCAEs was investigated, using Ag test aerosol particles with a 30 nm particle diameter by varying the inlet flowrates from 0.5 l min<sup>−1</sup> to 4 l min<sup>−1</sup>. From our experimental results, significant deviations were observed in FCAE currents at sample flowrates smaller than 1.5 l min<sup>−1</sup>. It is recommended that these discrepancies should be quantified before an FCAE is used for CPC calibration at low sample flowrates and small particle sizes in the sub-30 nm size range.</p>
