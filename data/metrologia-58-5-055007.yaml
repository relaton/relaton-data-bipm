abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report a measurement of the absolute frequency of the<sup>1</sup>S<sub>0</sub>–<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub>
    transition in the<sup>171</sup>Yb optical lattice clock at KRISS (KRISS-Yb1) for
    14 months, which was referenced to the SI second by primary and secondary standards
    worldwide via International Atomic Time. The determined absolute frequency is
    518 295 836 590 863.75(14) Hz with the relative frequency uncertainty of 2.6 ×
    10<sup>−16</sup>, which agrees well with other reports. This result is expected
    to contribute to the future update of the CIPM recommendation frequency of the
    secondary frequency standards.</p>
