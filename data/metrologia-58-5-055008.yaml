abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>According to our experimental results, a nitrogen flow used
    to prevent dust and moisture entering a detector may influence measurements performed
    with trap detectors in overfilled conditions. A stable light source was measured
    with a wedged trap detector with 4 mm aperture, and the nitrogen flow rate was
    varied. The nitrogen flow was found to have the largest effect of up to 0.8% on
    the responsivity of the detector at around 1.0 l min<sup>−1</sup> flow rate. The
    effect of nitrogen flow can be removed down to 0.02% by an added crossflow which
    removes the nitrogen out of the optical axis. In another experiment, the effect
    was removed almost completely by changing the flowing gas from nitrogen to synthetic
    dry air. We also present measurement results that indicate the responsivity changes
    with nitrogen to be smaller than 0.05% with underfilled beam geometry, even without
    the added crossflow. Based on simulations, the nitrogen flow through the detector
    forms a gradient-index type gas lens in front of the detector increasing the effective
    aperture area and thus the responsivity. In the underfilled measurement geometry
    there is no light close to the aperture edge which could be refracted inside the
    detector. Finally, we consider methods to ensure that the responsivity changes
    due to the gas flow remain below 0.05% in overfilled measurement geometry, without
    compromising the cleanliness of the detector with too small gas flow rate.</p>
