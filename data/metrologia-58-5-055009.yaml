    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Free-air ionization chambers (FAC) are accepted as the primary standard of x-ray dosimetry. The low-energy x-rays are important for basic beam quantities of diagnostics at the mammography level. This research explains the FAC characteristics of the Office of Atoms for Peace (OAP) that was developed by cooperation between the OAP, Thailand, and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science, Republic of Korea. The applied correction factors that are necessary for determination of the air kerma rate were investigated using an experimental method and Monte Carlo simulation methods with their uncertainties. The beam characteristics, computed using the Monte Carlo method and demonstrated in this paper, are important for calculation of the correction factors. Finally, the correction factors and uncertainties of the standard beam qualities, which are recommended by the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation, and W/Mo beam qualities are shown in this paper.</p>
