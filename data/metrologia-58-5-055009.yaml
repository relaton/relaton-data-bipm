abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Free-air ionization chambers (FAC) are accepted as the primary
    standard of x-ray dosimetry. The low-energy x-rays are important for basic beam
    quantities of diagnostics at the mammography level. This research explains the
    FAC characteristics of the Office of Atoms for Peace (OAP) that was developed
    by cooperation between the OAP, Thailand, and the Korea Research Institute of
    Standards and Science, Republic of Korea. The applied correction factors that
    are necessary for determination of the air kerma rate were investigated using
    an experimental method and Monte Carlo simulation methods with their uncertainties.
    The beam characteristics, computed using the Monte Carlo method and demonstrated
    in this paper, are important for calculation of the correction factors. Finally,
    the correction factors and uncertainties of the standard beam qualities, which
    are recommended by the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation, and W/Mo
    beam qualities are shown in this paper.</p>
