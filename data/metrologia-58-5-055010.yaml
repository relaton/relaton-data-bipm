abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the first measurements of kilowatt laser power with
    an uncertainty less than 1%. These represent progress toward the most accurate
    measurements of laser power above 1 kW at 1070Â nm wavelength and establish a more
    precise link between force metrology and laser power metrology. Radiation pressure,
    or photon momentum, is a relatively new method of non-destructively measuring
    laser power. We demonstrate how a multiple reflection optical system amplifies
    the pressure of a kilowatt class laser incoherently to improve the signal to noise
    ratio in a radiation pressure-based measurement. With 14 incoherent reflections
    of the laser, we measure a total uncertainty of 0.26% for an input power of 10
    kW and 0.46% for an input power of 1 kW at the 95% confidence level. These measurements
    of absolute power are traceable to the SI kilogram and mark a state-of-the-art
    improvement in measurement precision by a factor of four.</p>
