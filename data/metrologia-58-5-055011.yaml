    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The gravitational wave (GW) observatories calibrate interferometer displacement using photon momentum, with laser power serving as the measurand. These observatories are traceable to the International System of Units through a primary standard maintained by the US’s National Metrology Institute (NMI), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The bilateral degree of equivalence of laser power measurements for various NMIs indicated in the 2010 EUROMET.PR-S2 supplementary comparison reveals scale realization uncertainty unacceptably large for GW event parameterization. We offer here an analysis to identify the source of the discrepancy between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) and NIST results. Using an improved transfer standard in a bilateral comparison, with representatives of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) receiving results prior to their comparison, NIST and PTB demonstrated a degree of equivalence of −0.15% with an uncertainty of 0.95% (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2) for combined 100 mW and 300 mW comparison results.</p>
