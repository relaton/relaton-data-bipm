abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The gravitational wave (GW) observatories calibrate interferometer
    displacement using photon momentum, with laser power serving as the measurand.
    These observatories are traceable to the International System of Units through
    a primary standard maintained by the US’s National Metrology Institute (NMI),
    the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The bilateral degree
    of equivalence of laser power measurements for various NMIs indicated in the 2010
    EUROMET.PR-S2 supplementary comparison reveals scale realization uncertainty unacceptably
    large for GW event parameterization. We offer here an analysis to identify the
    source of the discrepancy between the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)
    and NIST results. Using an improved transfer standard in a bilateral comparison,
    with representatives of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
    (LIGO) receiving results prior to their comparison, NIST and PTB demonstrated
    a degree of equivalence of −0.15% with an uncertainty of 0.95% (k = 2) for combined
    100 mW and 300 mW comparison results.</p>
