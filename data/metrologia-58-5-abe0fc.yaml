abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Because of continued confusion caused by the SI’s interpretation
    of angle and solid angle as dimensionless quantities (and the radian and steradian
    as dimensionless derived units), it is time for the SI to treat these dimensional
    physical quantities correctly. Building on previous authors’ foundations, starting
    from Euclid’s Elements, I argue that angle should be recognized as a base quantity
    with an independent dimension: angle, A. A dimensionally consistent analysis of
    rotational geometry and mechanics results in the appearance of a constant of Nature
    equal to the central angle of a plane circular sector whose arc length is equal
    to that of its radius. This is the common (but not current SI) concept of the
    radian, rad, appropriately chosen as the base unit for angle. What the SI calls
    ‘angle’ is actually a nondimensionalized angle: the physical angle (dimension
    A) divided by one radian. Using a coordinate-system-independent definition of
    solid angle, I show that this is a derived quantity with dimension A<sup>2</sup>
    and appropriate unit radian-squared. The steradian is retained as a coherent derived
    unit: sr = rad<sup>2</sup>. Clarification of terminology is needed in distinguishing
    between ‘geometrical’ and ‘mathematical’ trigonometric functions and in related
    topics, including the distinction between frequency and angular velocity, and
    between phase and phase angle, among other things.</p>'
