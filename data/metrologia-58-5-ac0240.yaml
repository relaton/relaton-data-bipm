abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Currently, in the International System of Units (SI), reciprocal
    second (s<sup>−1</sup>) and radian per second (rad s<sup>−1</sup>) are the units
    of frequency ν and angular frequency ω, respectively. At the same time, these
    quantities are related in the SI by the simple mathematical relationship ω = 2πν.
    And here an evident conflict between this relation and the dimensions of the quantities
    included in it arises. When using the units in question, the two sides of this
    relation have different dimensions, which is not admissible in either physics
    or metrology. However, this situation has existed in metrology for many years.
    In 2019, the angular frequency with unit rad s<sup>−1</sup> was included in the
    SI brochure. This article analyzes the reasons that have led to this conflict
    and establishes the relationship between frequency, angular frequency and angular
    velocity. An example of a simple oscillatory system shows that ω and ν have the
    same dimension, inverse to the dimension of the time. Therefore, they are measured
    by the same unit s<sup>−1</sup>. This does not coincide with the current definition
    of the unit of angular frequency in the SI, but fully corresponds to the laws
    of physics and removes the contradiction in the relation ω = 2πν. It is also shown
    that the angular frequency and angular velocity are independent quantities of
    different dimensions.</p>
