abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The revised International System of Units (SI) came into force
    on May 20, 2019. Simultaneously, updated versions of supporting documents for
    the practical realization of the SI base units (mises en pratique) were published.
    This review paper provides an overview of the updated mise en pratique for the
    SI base unit of length, the metre, that now gives practical guidance on realisation
    of traceable length metrology spanning 24 orders of magnitude. The review begins
    by showing how the metre may be primarily realized through time of flight and
    interferometric techniques using a variety of types of interferometer. Examples
    of techniques for measuring the interferometric phase and coping when the integer
    interference order is unknown are then described, together with examples of typical
    uncertainty contributions that may be encountered. The requirements for traceable
    nanoscale metrology and the need for an alternative secondary metre as identified
    by the Consultative Committee for Length’s Working Group on Nanometrology are
    outlined. These led to the inclusion in the mise en pratique of secondary realisations
    of the length unit at the nanometre and sub nanometre scale, based on the lattice
    spacing of silicon. Three measurement techniques using this secondary realisation
    are then described in detail. The paper concludes by emphasising that measurements
    made today over 24 order of magnitude are still compatible with measurements made
    using the metre as adopted over 200 years ago.</p>
