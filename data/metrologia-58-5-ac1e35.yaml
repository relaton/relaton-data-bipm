abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The characteristics of a predictable quantum efficient detector
    (PQED) in terms of optical non-linearity in the visible to near-infrared range
    were investigated under zero-bias and reverse-bias voltage conditions. In the
    zero-bias condition, linear behavior was observed in the wavelength from 405 nm
    to 1060 nm in the photocurrent range of 1 nA to 10 μA, and saturation occurred
    for photocurrents over 10 μA for all wavelengths. In the reverse-bias voltage
    of 10 V, the linear behavior was observed in the photocurrent range of 64 nA to
    1 mA except for the wavelength of 1060 nm, and the saturation photocurrent increased
    up to 1 mA. The supralinearity value at 1060 nm increased sharply from the photocurrent
    of 100 μA, and its maximum value reached up to 0.34% at the photocurrent of 1
    mA because of the back surface recombination and the longer absorption length.
    The spectral linearity results of the PQED help us to understand the charge-carrier
    loss mechanism in the PQED, and would lead to more accurate optical measurement
    with it.</p>
