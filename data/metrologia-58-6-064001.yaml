abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>High-accuracy length measurements of prismatic bodies (e.g.
    gauge blocks) are usually performed by means of single-ended interferometers.
    To perform these measurements, the gauge block must be wrung to a reference plate.
    The quality of contact affects the measured length and also the wringing process
    wears down or damages the measuring faces. Furthermore, it limits the use of such
    interferometers to bodies that are suitable for wringing. PTB’s double-ended interferometer
    allows high-accuracy length measurements that are traceable to the International
    System of Units to be performed without a reference plate. However, because the
    setup of this interferometer is complex and additional optical components are
    required the alignment process is challenging. Compliance with the defined gauge-block
    length in ISO 3650 is also challenging, especially for non-perfect shaped gauge
    blocks. In this work, we develop a precise alignment method for the double-ended
    interferometer and systematically study the contributions of misalignments to
    the uncertainty of the measured length. In order to explore the accuracy of the
    developed procedure and to estimate the size of the uncertainty caused by deviations
    from perfect gauge block shapes, virtual experiments are carried out using the
    PTB library SimOptDevice. The virtual experiment is validated by a comparison
    to experimental data. In addition, theoretical relations are confirmed. Finally,
    Monte Carlo runs of the virtual experiment are performed to quantitatively explore
    the size of different sources of uncertainty on the developed alignment method.
    The results suggest that the developed alignment method is highly accurate and
    is expected to yield an uncertainty contribution to the final length measurement
    in the sub-nanometer range.</p>
