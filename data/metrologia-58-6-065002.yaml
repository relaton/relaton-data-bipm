abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A new saturator-based low frost-point generator (LFPG 2) is
    developed at the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), and
    its uncertainty is evaluated from 7 nmol·mol<sup>−1</sup> to 1000 nmol·mol<sup>−1</sup>
    in nitrogen. The humidity generator operates in the two-temperature two-pressure
    mode to achieve target water vapor concentrations. First, the apparatus of the
    generator and the operation procedures, including purging mode and generation
    mode, are introduced in depth. Then, all uncertainty factors that affect trace-moisture
    generations are analyzed using a hygrometer based on cavity-ring down spectroscopy.
    Consequently, the expanded relative uncertainties in the range of (7–1000) nmol·mol<sup>−1</sup>
    are 5.0%–1.0% at a coverage factor of k = 2, respectively. It is found that the
    effect of water adsorption/desorption is significantly reduced with compact design and
    sufficient purging. Thus, the uncertainty of the generator is enhanced compared
    with trace-moisture standards in other national metrology institutes including
    the KRISS LFPG 1. Finally, the time scales of humidity generations for various
    flow rates are investigated for efficient calibration of the hygrometers.</p>
