abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An automatic alignment technique was developed for the joule
    balance to reduce the uncertainty caused by alignment errors. Using the flexures
    and decoupling structure of the suspended coil, the proposed alignment system
    can automatically recognize the linear relationship between the initial position
    and posture of the suspended coil when the current is off, and its parasitic horizontal
    linear and angular displacements when the current is on. Subsequently, several
    actuators including mini-motors and an Xâ€“Y stage are controlled to adjust the
    position and posture of the coil, minimizing the parasitic forces and torques
    and reducing them by approximately 100 times in comparison with the alignment
    results of the joule balance obtained in 2019, whilst maintaining the adjustment
    time to several minutes only.</p>
