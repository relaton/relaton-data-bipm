abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Industrial emissions into the atmosphere are quantified by measuring
    the concentration and flow rate in a duct or stack prior to release. These measurements
    are combined to produce a mass emission which is reported to the European Pollutant
    Release and Transfer Register. These measurements have to be made according to
    standards to ensure that they are consistent and accurate. Uncertainty limits
    are set in relevant EU legislation which must be adhered to. The standard for
    flow measurement, EN ISO 16911, is in two parts covering manual reference methods
    and automated measuring systems (AMS). The former outlines six validated methods
    for calibrating an AMS, while the later outlines the quality control system to
    be followed to meet the requirements of the legislation. However the standard
    does not provide consistent information on the impact of the different calibration
    methods on the uncertainty of the reported emissions. Here we model a system monitoring
    stack flow and pollutant concentration, including quality control procedures in
    EN ISO 16911. Several alternative reference methods are modelled to compare the
    effects of using these different techniques for calibration on the uncertainty
    of reported annual mass emissions. In a low uncertainty regime the L- and S-type
    Pitot provide the best performance for both constant and variable flows, however
    in higher uncertainty regimes all the techniques led to a bias that would lead
    to misreporting of emissions. Uncertainty information on the techniques is not
    equally characterised, however, this information represents the best current knowledge
    of these uncertainties in the emissions community and so the comparisons reported
    here are all made with the best knowledge available.</p>
