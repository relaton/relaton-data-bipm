abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>One of the cornerstones of the international measurement system
    is a requirement for national metrology institutes (NMIs) to compare their primary
    measurement standards in order to harmonize measurements worldwide. The need for
    regular comparison exercises is captured in a mutual recognition arrangement under
    the auspices of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (the CIPM
    MRA). These comparisons demonstrate the equivalence of the measurements from NMIs
    with an international reference value built on the consensus of all participating
    laboratories. Many approaches have been developed and are available today to estimate
    such a reference value. An alternative method based on an algorithm drawn from
    the science of evolution has been investigated. It displays an interesting behaviour
    towards extreme values which are a crucial problem for consensus building. The
    algorithm was compared with various approaches for processing a simulated data
    set and data from an international comparison in radionuclide metrology.</p>
