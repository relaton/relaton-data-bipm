abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We developed a primary standard for low liquid hydrocarbon flow
    rates that works on light oil (diesel), kerosene and industrial gasoline. To achieve
    a calibration accuracy of below 0.1% over a wide flow range from 0.02 L h<sup>−1</sup>
    to 100 L h<sup>−1</sup> as required by the industry, this primary standard adopts
    the gravimetric calibration method performing static weighing with flying-start-and-finish,
    incorporating a compactly designed conical rotating double-wing diverter for the
    upper flow range (1 L h<sup>−1</sup> to 100 L h<sup>−1</sup>) and a pair of high-speed
    switching valves as a diverter for the lower flow range (0.02 L h<sup>−1</sup>
    to 6 L h<sup>−1</sup>). The uncertainty of liquid mass measurement (in which the
    evaporation error is a dominant factor) as well as the uncertainty of liquid collection
    time (in which the diverter timing error is a major factor) are minimized to a
    level that curbs their dominance to the overall mass flow uncertainty. On the
    other hand, the uncertainty due to the estimation of liquid density at the flowmeter
    under test, which is a significant contributing factor to the overall uncertainty
    of volumetric flow, is being reduced by temperature control measures through a
    self-developed thermostatic chamber. Intra-facility and inter-facility comparisons
    within NMIJ were performed, all showing a good agreement, and hence providing
    supporting evidence for the calibration and measurement capability (CMC), which
    are 0.020%–0.044% for the mass flow rates and 0.044%–0.066% for the volumetric
    flow rates as claimed by the facility.</p>
