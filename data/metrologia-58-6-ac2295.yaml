abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The variation of the effective area and zero-offset of an extrapolation
    chamber used for beta-ray and low-energy x-ray dosimetry was measured as a function
    of temperature in the range 19 °C to 25 °C. The effective area and zero-offset
    were determined from the capacitance of the extrapolation chamber measured with
    the chamber depths in the range up to 1.4 mm. The extrapolation chamber was put
    in a precision thermostatic air bath with a programmable temperature regulator
    to evaluate the influence of temperature on it. At room temperature we found the
    thermal expansion coefficients to be (8.55 ± 0.57) × 10<sup>−5</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>
    for the effective area and (2.83 ± 0.03) µm K<sup>−1</sup> for the depth of the
    extrapolation chamber. The influence of thermal expansion of the extrapolation
    chamber on the ionization current measurement was estimated to be about 3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>
    when the measurement depth was 1 mm.</p>
