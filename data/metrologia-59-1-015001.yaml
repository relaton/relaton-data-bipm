    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>An important step in establishing any new metrological method is a prenormative interlaboratory study, designed to verify and validate the method against its stated aims. Here, the <sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer spectrometric ‘centre of gravity’ (COG) method was tested as a means of quantifying the magnetite/maghemite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) composition ratio in biphasic magnetic nanoparticles. The study involved seven laboratories across Europe and North and South America, and six samples—a verification set of three microcrystalline mixtures of known composition, and a validation set of three nanoparticle samples of unknown composition. The spectra were analysed by each participant using in-house fitting packages, and <italic toggle="yes">ex post facto</italic> by a single operator using an independent package. Repeatability analysis was performed using Mandel’s <italic toggle="yes">h</italic> statistic and modified Youden plots. It is shown that almost all (83/84) of the Mandel <italic toggle="yes">h</italic> statistic values fall within the 0.5% significance level, with the one exception being borderline. Youden-based pairwise analysis indicates the dominance of random uncertainties; and in almost all cases the data analysis phase is only a minor contributor to the overall measurement uncertainty. It is concluded that the COG method is a robust and promising candidate for its intended purpose.</p>
