abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An important step in establishing any new metrological method
    is a prenormative interlaboratory study, designed to verify and validate the method
    against its stated aims. Here, the<sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer spectrometric ‘centre
    of gravity’ (COG) method was tested as a means of quantifying the magnetite/maghemite
    (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/γ-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) composition ratio
    in biphasic magnetic nanoparticles. The study involved seven laboratories across
    Europe and North and South America, and six samples—a verification set of three
    microcrystalline mixtures of known composition, and a validation set of three
    nanoparticle samples of unknown composition. The spectra were analysed by each
    participant using in-house fitting packages, and ex post facto by a single operator
    using an independent package. Repeatability analysis was performed using Mandel’s
    h statistic and modified Youden plots. It is shown that almost all (83/84) of
    the Mandel h statistic values fall within the 0.5% significance level, with the
    one exception being borderline. Youden-based pairwise analysis indicates the dominance
    of random uncertainties; and in almost all cases the data analysis phase is only
    a minor contributor to the overall measurement uncertainty. It is concluded that
    the COG method is a robust and promising candidate for its intended purpose.</p>
