abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Optical clocks have reached such an impressive accuracy and
    stability that the future redefinition of the second will be probably based on
    an optical transition. Consequently, building time scales based on optical clocks
    has become a key problem. Unfortunately, optical clocks are still laboratory prototypes
    and are not yet capable of long times of autonomous operation. It is hence critical
    to understand the impact of this limited optical clock availability on the generated
    time scale. In this work, after describing a simple and effective optical time
    scale algorithm, based on the steering of a flywheel oscillator towards the optical
    clock, we investigate in detail the impact of the limited availability of the
    optical clock on the performances of the steering algorithm and of the generated
    time scale through numerical simulations. In particular, we simulate a time scale
    generated by a hydrogen maser (with a flicker floor of 5.5 × 10<sup>−16</sup>)
    steered towards an optical clock, by considering six different scenarios for the
    availability of the latter, spanning from the ideal one, i.e. continuous operation
    of the optical clock, to the worst one, i.e. non-uniformly distributed frequency
    measurements with long unavailability periods. The results prove that the steering
    algorithm is robust and effective despite its very simple implementation, and
    it is capable of very good performances in all the considered scenarios, provided
    that the hydrogen maser behaves nominally. Specifically, they show that a time
    scale with an accuracy of a few hundreds of picoseconds can be easily realized
    in the ideal scenario, whereas in a more realistic scenario, with one measurement
    per week only, the time accuracy is nonetheless of a few nanoseconds, competing
    with the best time scales currently realized worldwide. The performances degradation
    due to a non-nominal maser behaviour is also discussed.</p>
