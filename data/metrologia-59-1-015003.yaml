abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>At LNE-Cnam, the international temperature scale of 1990 (ITS-90)
    and thermodynamic temperature measurements above the silver point, are carried
    out with a radiance comparator. This instrument is, more generally, devoted to
    any radiance comparison in temperature range from the ambient to 3000 °C. The
    instrument developed in the early 1990s at LNE-Cnam has the advantage of being
    completely adjustable. Compared to compact radiation thermometers based on lenses
    and a narrow-band interference filter, the radiance comparator is only made of
    gold coated mirrors and a Czerny–Turner monochromator to select the spectral bandwidth.
    The instrument offers the possibility to tune the geometric extent and the slit
    scattering function. In return, the radiance comparator is a complex instrument
    that requires a complete and a regular characterisation at the highest level of
    accuracy. In the first part, this paper describes the instrument and its operating
    principle. In a second part, a complete study of the wavelength calibration, the
    slit scattering function, size of source effect, out-of-band transmittance, linearity
    and other main sources of uncertainty are presented and discussed. Their associated
    uncertainties are estimated separately and are grouped together to give an example
    of propagation of uncertainties when realising the ITS-90.</p>
