abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A high-precision sampler, Fluke 8588A multimeter in the sampling
    mode, was utilised to perform differential sampling of AC waveforms with a programmable
    Josephson voltage standard. The systematic error on the differential sampling,
    induced by the inherent voltage-response characteristics and built-in low-pass
    filter of the sampler, was estimated. Experimental results and numerical simulations
    revealed that the sampler could be used for reliable differential sampling of
    AC waveforms at frequencies up to several kilohertz, with an appropriate number
    of the voltage steps per the waveform period, when the input bandwidth was set
    to 3 MHz. In addition, the sampler was compared to an integrating sampler, Keysight
    3458A, now widely used for differential sampling. At 62.5 Hz, a key frequency
    in the future on-site key comparison of the differential sampling on AC voltage,
    the difference in root mean square (RMS) amplitudes obtained by the differential
    sampling using the two different samplers is approximately 150 nV V<sup>−1</sup>
    due to the systematic error caused by the limited bandwidth of 150 kHz for the
    integrating sampler.</p>
