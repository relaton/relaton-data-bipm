abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Supplement 1 to the GUM (GUM-S1) extends the GUM uncertainty
    framework to non-linear functions and non-Gaussian distributions. For this purpose,
    it employs a Monte Carlo method that yields a probability density function for
    the measurand. This Monte Carlo method has been successfully applied in numerous
    applications throughout metrology. However, considerable criticism has been raised
    against the type A uncertainty evaluation of GUM-S1. Most of the criticism could
    be addressed by including prior information about the measurand which, however,
    is beyond the scope of GUM-S1. We propose an alternative Monte Carlo method that
    will allow prior information about the measurand to be included. The proposed
    method is based on a Bayesian uncertainty evaluation and applies a simple rejection
    sampling approach using the Monte Carlo techniques of GUM-S1. The range of applicability
    of the approach is explored theoretically and in terms of examples. The results
    are promising, leading us to conclude that many metrological applications could
    benefit from this approach. Software support is provided to ease its implementation.</p>
