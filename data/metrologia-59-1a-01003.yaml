abstract:
- content: Main text<p>AFRIMETS.EM-S1 supplementary comparison on resistance standards
    at 1 Ω, 10 Ω, 100 Ω, 1 kΩ and 10 kΩ commenced November 2015 and ended June 2018.
    The comparison approved by AFRIMETS technical committee for Electricity and Magnetism
    (TC-EM) and Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM). Seven
    National Metrology Institutes participated including National Metrology Institute
    of South Africa (NMISA)the pilot laboratory. The primary objective of the comparison
    is aimed to underpin and strengthen the capabilities of the National Metrology
    Institutes and establish the degree of equivalence and comparability. The results
    of the participants are found to be equivalent, comparable and in agreement with
    the comparison reference values within stated uncertainties of measurements.</p><p>To
