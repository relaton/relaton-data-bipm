    <p>AFRIMETS.EM-S1 supplementary comparison on resistance standards at 1 Ω, 10 Ω, 100 Ω, 1 kΩ and 10 kΩ commenced November 2015 and ended June 2018. The comparison approved by AFRIMETS technical committee for Electricity and Magnetism (TC-EM) and Consultative Committee for Electricity and Magnetism (CCEM). Seven National Metrology Institutes participated including National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA)the pilot laboratory. The primary objective of the comparison is aimed to underpin and strengthen the capabilities of the National Metrology Institutes and establish the degree of equivalence and comparability. The results of the participants are found to be equivalent, comparable and in agreement with the comparison reference values within stated uncertainties of measurements.</p>
