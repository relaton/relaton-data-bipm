abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance
    between the INMETRO (Brazil) and the BIPM carried out from November 2020 to September
    2021. Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used.
    The comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards
    were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a period
    of about two months at the INMETRO, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand
    was the 4 terminal dc resistance at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory,
    and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a
    (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13b (for 10 kΩ).</p><p>The results from the INMETRO and
    the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference D smaller than
    the relative expanded uncertainty Uc (95% confidence, k = 2) giving D = 0.010
    × 10<sup>-6</sup>, Uc = 0.068 x 10<sup>-6</sup> for 1 Ω and     D = 0.026 x 10<sup>-6</sup>,
    Uc = 0.036 x 10<sup>-6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
