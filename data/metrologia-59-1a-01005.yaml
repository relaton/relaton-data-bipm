  content: "<title>Main text</title>\n<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison
    BIPM.EM-K11, a comparison of the 1.018 V and 10 V voltage reference standards
    of the BIPM and the Service Métrologie - Metrologische Dienst (SMD), Brussels,
    Belgium, was carried out from October to December 2021. Two BIPM Zener diode-based
    travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_B (ZB) and BIPM_6 (Z6), were transported
    to SMD and back to BIPM by road. At SMD, the reference standard for DC voltage
    is a Josephson Voltage Standard (JVS). The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of
    each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the primary standard.</p>\n<p>The
    final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values
    assigned to DC voltage standards by SMD, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at
    SMD, USMD, and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, UBIPM, at the reference
    date of the 17th of November 2021.</p>\n<p>\n               <italic toggle=\"yes\">U</italic>\n
