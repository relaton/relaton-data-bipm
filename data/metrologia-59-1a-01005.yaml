abstract:
- content: "Main text<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11, a
    comparison of the 1.018 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and
    the Service Métrologie - Metrologische Dienst (SMD), Brussels, Belgium, was carried
    out from October to December 2021. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards
    (Fluke 732B), BIPM_B (ZB) and BIPM_6 (Z6), were transported to SMD and back to
    BIPM by road. At SMD, the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage
    Standard (JVS). The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard
    was measured by direct comparison with the primary standard.</p><p>The final result
    of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned to
    DC voltage standards by SMD, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at SMD, USMD, and
    those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, UBIPM, at the reference date of the 17th
    of November 2021.</p><p>\n U<sub>SMD</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = -0.03 μV;\tu<sub>c</sub>
    = 0.13 μV, at 1.018 V</p><p>\n U<sub>SMD</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = 0.02 μV;\tu<sub>c</sub>
    = 0.28 μV, at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty
    associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation
    of the volt at the BIPM and at SMD, based on K<sub>J</sub>, and the uncertainty
    related to the comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on
    Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM
    key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>"
