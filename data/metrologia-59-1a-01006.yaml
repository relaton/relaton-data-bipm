    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This document presents the final report of the supplementary comparison identified as SIM.EM.RF-S17 and carried out by the NMI (National Metrology Institute) from Argentina (INTI) and Germany (PTB).</p>
    <p>The measurands were S-parameters up to 32 GHz in 3.5 mm coaxial connector. In addition, this comparison shows how digitalization during the measurement process and data analysis can improve a comparison outcome, this comparison being one of the first comparisons under BIPM scope in which exchanged data between participants consisted of digital uncertainty objects based on an XML structure.</p>
