abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This document presents the final report of the supplementary
    comparison identified as SIM.EM.RF-S17 and carried out by the NMI (National Metrology
    Institute) from Argentina (INTI) and Germany (PTB).</p><p>The measurands were
    S-parameters up to 32 GHz in 3.5 mm coaxial connector. In addition, this comparison
    shows how digitalization during the measurement process and data analysis can
    improve a comparison outcome, this comparison being one of the first comparisons
    under BIPM scope in which exchanged data between participants consisted of digital
    uncertainty objects based on an XML structure.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on  Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
