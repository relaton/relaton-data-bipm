    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>In order to calibrate an LCR meter, metrological traceability of capacitance above 10 kHz becomes more and more important. For this reason, NIM (National Institute of Metrology, China)ï¼ŒNPLI (National Physical Laboratory, India) and NIMT (National Institute of Metrology, Thailand) have carried out research on capacitance metrology from 10 kHz to 10 MHz.</p>
