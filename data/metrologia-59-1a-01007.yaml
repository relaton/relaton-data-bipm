abstract:
- content: Main text<p>In order to calibrate an LCR meter, metrological traceability
    of capacitance above 10 kHz becomes more and more important. For this reason,
    NIM (National Institute of Metrology, China)ï¼ŒNPLI (National Physical Laboratory,
    India) and NIMT (National Institute of Metrology, Thailand) have carried out research
    on capacitance metrology from 10 kHz to 10 MHz.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in
    Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
