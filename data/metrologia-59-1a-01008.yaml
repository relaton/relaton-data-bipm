abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The intercomparison consisted of calibrating a High Voltage
    Travelling Reference Measuring System, TRMS, using peak and rms voltage values,
    at the frequency of 50 Hz and with voltages of 750 V, 1 kV, 40 kV, 80 kV, 120
    kV, 160 kV and 200 kV.</p><p>The TRMS consisted of a capacitive divider with fixed
    input and grounding leads, a coaxial cable, a HP 3458A digital multimeter and
    a computer with a printer. The TRMS had two ranges, 20 kV and 200 kV, depending
    on the low voltage arm connected to the high voltage capacitor. The TRMS included
    the low voltage digital multimeter, in such a way that the measuring error of
    high voltage TRMS should be measured to determine the scale factor of the high
    voltage divider. Intercomparison results are expressed as the scale factor of
    the travelling high voltage capacitive divider, the scale factor is dimensionless.</p><p>Complementary
    low voltage measurements were also performed to check how the peak voltage is
    evaluated when harmonics or distortion are superimposed to sinusoidal waveforms.
    To evaluate this performance an arbitrary waveform generator was included among
    the travelling devices in such a way that it was possible to compare the peak
    voltage measured by the TRMS using the provided digital multimeter and the specific
    intercomparison software and the peak voltage measured by each participant.</p><p>The
    coordinating laboratory was LCOE (Spain) and the participating institutes were
    LNE (France), VTT MIKES (Finland), RISE (Sweden), TÜBITAK UME (Türkiye), PTB (Germany),
    BIM (Bulgaria), INRiM (Italy), VSL (Netherlands), VNIMS (Russia) and LCOE (Spain).</p><p>Results
    of the comparison proved the calibration and measurement capabilities, CMCs, of
    the participants in the field of high voltage AC measurement, especially when
    performing peak hv measurements up to 200 kV with expanded uncertainties in the
    range of 40 mV/V to 80 mV/V.</p><p>The discrepancy between the results of the
    two labs claiming the lowest uncertainties, PTB and VTT, was on some measurements
    significantly larger than the respective uncertainties. One of these labs redesigned
    its measuring system and a subsequent bilateral comparison arranged between PTB
    and VTT solved the discrepancy.</p><p>Undertaking the work collaboratively through
    EURAMET proved to be an excellent tool to compare calibration and measurement
    capabilities of NMI and DI, as well as an opportunity for several institutes to
    improve their CMCs.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
