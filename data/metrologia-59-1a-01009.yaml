abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The intercomparison consisted of calibrating the capacitance
    and loss factor (tan δ) of a set of reference capacitors at different voltage
    levels, including high voltage up to 200 kV, for frequencies between 50 Hz and
    1kHz in low voltage measurements and 50 Hz in high voltage measurements.</p><p>The
    travelling standards consisted of a set of four reference capacitors (TRC) with
    fixed input and grounding leads and the corresponding connection cables of the
    following rated characteristics:</p><p>* System 1: 100 pF and rated voltage of
    200 kV.</p><p>* System 2: 100 pF and rated voltage of 700 V.</p><p>* System 3:
    500 nF and rated voltage of 10 V.</p><p>* System 4: 5000 nF and rated voltage
    of 10 V.</p><p>The coordinating laboratory was LCOE (Spain) and the participating
    institutes were LNE (France), VTT MIKES (Finland), RISE (Sweden), TÜBITAK UME
    (Türkiye), PTB (Germany) and LCOE (Spain). Participants used their best measurement
    procedures and setups in order to achieve their best calibration capabilities.</p><p>Some
    of the institutes did not perform all the measurements, therefore comparison reference
    values are based sometimes in the results of only 4 institutes.</p><p>Not all
    the laboratories measured at the same ambient temperature; to prevent this inconvenience
    and to be able to compare results, all capacitance values were corrected at 23
    °C. The long drift of the high voltage capacitor of system 1, probably due to
    some small SF6 leakage, was also considered to calculate the CRV of each institute.
    Very good agreement between institutes is obtained for high voltage capacitance
    measurements (high voltage capacitance coefficient determination) and for low
    or high voltage dissipation factor measurements. Only a few low voltage measurements
    of capacitance are considered not compatible.</p><p>Undertaking the work collaboratively
    through EURAMET proved to be an excellent tool to compare calibration and measurement
    capabilities of NMI and DI, as well as an opportunity for several institutes to
    improve their CMCs.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
