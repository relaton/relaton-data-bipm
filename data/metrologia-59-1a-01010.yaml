abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report gives the result of a bilateral comparison of resistance
    between the NPLI (India) and the BIPM carried out from August 2021 to April 2022.
    Two 1 Ω and two 10 kΩ travelling standards belonging to the BIPM were used. The
    comparison was carried out with an 'A-B-A' pattern of measurements; the standards
    were measured first at the BIPM for a period of about one month, then for a period
    of about one month at the NPLI, and finally again at the BIPM. The measurand was
    the 4 terminal dc resistances at low power. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory,
    and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparisons BIPM.EM-K13.a
    (for 1 Ω) and BIPM.EM-K13b (for 10 kΩ).</p><p>The results from the NPLI and the
    BIPM were found to be in good agreement for 1 Ω but not for the 10 kΩ. The difference
    D is smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty U<sub>c</sub> (95% confidence,
    k = 2) giving D = 0.365 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, U<sub>c</sub> = 0.870 × 10<sup>-6</sup>
    for 1 Ω. The difference D is higher than the relative expanded uncertainty U<sub>c</sub>
    (95% confidence, k = 2) giving D = 0.306 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, U<sub>c</sub> = 0.166
    × 10<sup>-6</sup> for 10 kΩ.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
