    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A comparison of high voltage transformer measuring systems between SE "Ukrmetrteststandard" (Ukraine), TÜBİTAK (Turkey) and NMCC SASO (Saudi Arabia), conducted between November 2020 and December 2021. Voltage transformers ПЭТН-6/10 and НЛЛ-35 are used as the traveling standards and SE "Ukrmetrteststandard" acted as the pilot laboratory. Measurements were performed at a current from 6 kV to 35 kV at frequencies 50 Hz and 60 Hz.</p>
