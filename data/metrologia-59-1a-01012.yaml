abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A comparison of high current transformer measuring systems
    between SE "Ukrmetrteststandard" (Ukraine), TÜBİTAK (Turkey) and NMCC SASO (Saudi
    Arabia), conducted between December 2020 and December 2021. Current transformer
    СА535/2 is used as the traveling standard and SE "Ukrmetrteststandard" acted as
    the pilot laboratory. Measurements were performed at a current from 5 A to 4000
    A at frequencies 50 Hz and 60 Hz.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,

    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according
