abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The metrological equivalence of national measurement standards
    in the field of photometry and radiometry is determined by a set of key comparisons
    chosen and organised by the Consultative Committee of Photometry and Radiometry
    (CCPR) of the Comité international des poids et mesures (CIPM), working closely
    with the Regional Metrology Organisations (RMOs). In September 2009 the CCPR decided
    that a second round of the key comparison K3 Luminous Intensity be commenced.
    The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) was chosen to pilot this comparison.
    A total of 12 participants were selected from the three RMO group members: EURAMET&amp;COOMET
    (6: IO-CSIC, LNE-CNAM, METAS, NPL, PTB, VNIIOFI), APMP&amp;AFRIMETS (4: NMISA,
    NIM, NMIA, NMIJ), and SIM (2: NIST, NRC). The comparison was organised as a star
    comparison (NMI-Pilot-NMI) using incandescent standard lamps supplied by each
    NMI (National Metrology Institute) as the travelling comparison artifact. This
    report describes the comparison organisation (Section 2), the measurement methods
    and uncertainties achieved at all the participants and at the pilot (Sections
    3 and 4), and the method for analysis and the results of the comparison according
    to this method (Section 4). It includes a comparison of the results of this comparison
    with the 1999 first round key comparison (Section 5). Section 6 presents a summary
    of the comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
