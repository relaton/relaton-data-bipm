    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The metrological equivalence of national measurement standards in the field of photometry and radiometry is determined by a set of key comparisons chosen and organised by the Consultative Committee of Photometry and Radiometry (CCPR) of the Comité international des poids et mesures (CIPM), working closely with the Regional Metrology Organisations (RMOs). In September 2009 the CCPR decided that a second round of the key comparison K3 Luminous Intensity be commenced. The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) was chosen to pilot this comparison. A total of 12 participants were selected from the three RMO group members: EURAMET&amp;COOMET (6: IO-CSIC, LNE-CNAM, METAS, NPL, PTB, VNIIOFI), APMP&amp;AFRIMETS (4: NMISA, NIM, NMIA, NMIJ), and SIM (2: NIST, NRC). The comparison was organised as a star comparison (NMI-Pilot-NMI) using incandescent standard lamps supplied by each NMI (National Metrology Institute) as the travelling comparison artifact. This report describes the comparison organisation (Section 2), the measurement methods and uncertainties achieved at all the participants and at the pilot (Sections 3 and 4), and the method for analysis and the results of the comparison according to this method (Section 4). It includes a comparison of the results of this comparison with the 1999 first round key comparison (Section 5). Section 6 presents a summary of the comparison.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
