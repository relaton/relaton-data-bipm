    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This comparison piloted by CEM (ES), started in Nov 19 and concluded with some delay in February 21. Participants were CEM, PTB, SMD, METAS, INRIM and CMI.</p>
    <p>Two sets of eight gauge blocks in both steel and ceramic were circulated, covering the range 1.5 mm to 100 mm. The gauge blocks were of rectangular cross section and comply with the calibration grade K of ISO 3650 standard.</p>
    <p>Main measurand to be reported was the deviation ec of the central length lc from the nominal length ln of the gauge block. The arithmetic mean of the two values for wringing on both faces was considered as representative for ec In cases where only one face was wrung the corresponding value was reported as the result. As an auxiliary measurand the difference of the found deviations dc when the block was wrung to face A and face B, respectively, was reported.</p>
    <p>The uncertainty of measurement was evaluated according to the ISO Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. For efficient evaluation and subsequent assessment of CMC claims an uncertainty statement in the functional form was preferred.</p>
    <p>The key comparison reference value (KCRV) was calculated on a gauge-per-gauge basis as the weighted mean of the participants' results. The check for consistency of the comparison results with their associated uncertainties was based on Birge ratio and the degrees of equivalence for each laboratory and gauge block with respect to the KCRV were evaluated by using En values, in line with the WG-MRA-KC-report-template.</p>
    <p>Looking at the principal measurand, the central length ec, there were in total 11 values out of 96 not compatible with the final reference values, this representing the 11.4 % of the full set of results, considering both materials. With respect to the difference in central length from wringing in faces A and B, dc, there were in total 6 values not compatible with the reference value, this representing a 6.5 % of the 92 values communicated.</p>
