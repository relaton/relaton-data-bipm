abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This comparison piloted by CEM (ES), started in Nov 19 and
    concluded with some delay in February 21. Participants were CEM, PTB, SMD, METAS,
    INRIM and CMI.</p><p>Two sets of eight gauge blocks in both steel and ceramic
    were circulated, covering the range 1.5 mm to 100 mm. The gauge blocks were of
    rectangular cross section and comply with the calibration grade K of ISO 3650
    standard.</p><p>Main measurand to be reported was the deviation ec of the central
    length lc from the nominal length ln of the gauge block. The arithmetic mean of
    the two values for wringing on both faces was considered as representative for
    ec In cases where only one face was wrung the corresponding value was reported
    as the result. As an auxiliary measurand the difference of the found deviations
    dc when the block was wrung to face A and face B, respectively, was reported.</p><p>The
    uncertainty of measurement was evaluated according to the ISO Guide to the Expression
    of Uncertainty in Measurement. For efficient evaluation and subsequent assessment
    of CMC claims an uncertainty statement in the functional form was preferred.</p><p>The
    key comparison reference value (KCRV) was calculated on a gauge-per-gauge basis
    as the weighted mean of the participants' results. The check for consistency of
    the comparison results with their associated uncertainties was based on Birge
    ratio and the degrees of equivalence for each laboratory and gauge block with
    respect to the KCRV were evaluated by using En values, in line with the WG-MRA-KC-report-template.</p><p>Looking
    at the principal measurand, the central length ec, there were in total 11 values
    out of 96 not compatible with the final reference values, this representing the
    11.4 % of the full set of results, considering both materials. With respect to
    the difference in central length from wringing in faces A and B, dc, there were
    in total 6 values not compatible with the reference value, this representing a
    6.5 % of the 92 values communicated.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
