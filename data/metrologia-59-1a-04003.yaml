abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The results of the supplementary comparison EURAMET.L-S30 on
    roundness measurement on two spheres by using error separation techniques are
    reported. Five National Metrology Institutes from EURAMET participated in this
    comparison, which lasted nine months from March 2020 to November 2020.</p><p>Two
    alumina spheres with diameters of 20 mm and 25 mm, respectively, were circulated.
    The sphere standards were permanently glued to base supports made of steel and
    they had to be clamped by each laboratory's own usual methods. The measurand was
    the roundness defect, measured on the equator. Peak-to-valley roundness deviation
    (RONt) had to be evaluated with reference to the least squares reference circle
    (LSCI) and, if possible, to the minimum zone reference circles (MZCI), in accordance
    with the ISO/TS 12181-1:2011.</p><p>Each laboratory had to use an error separation
    technique to remove the contribution of the spindle error. In case of using a
    multistep technique it was advisable to inform on the number of steps used.</p><p>All
    participants successfully demonstrated the validity of the claimed measurement
    capability. Three of them submitted their approved CMCs and two others smaller
    values which were shown to be valid when compared to the reference value. One
    participant did not use an error separation technique, showing, as expected, a
    higher uncertainty with respect to the rest of the participants but according
    to its declared CMC.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
