abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Gauge blocks are one of the main artifacts used to calibrate
    length measuring instruments. The highest grade gauge blocks are calibrated by
    interferometry making them traceable to the length unit, the metre. The transfer
    of the wavelength of light to these artifacts is a challenging calibration that
    requires state-of-the-art equipment, good control of ambient conditions  and knowledgeable
    personnel.  It is one of the main calibration services offered by National Metrology
    Institutes. The Consultative Committee for Length (CCL) has established key comparisons
    as a means for assuring world-wide traceability and equivalence of length measurements
    at the highest levels of accuracy. In the key comparison reported here, there
    were twelve participants from EURAMET, COOMET, AFRIMET, APMP, and SIM regions.
    This comparison was based on the circulation of seven short steel gauge blocks,
    six short ceramic gauge blocks, and three steel long gauge blocks. The exercise
    was successful, and the results of the participants are reported here.</p><p>To

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
