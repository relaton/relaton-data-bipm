    Metrology Institutes, (10 from APMP, 3 from EURAMET, 1 from SIM, and 1 from AFRIMETS)
    have participated in this comparison, where a 500 mm line scale made of low thermal
    expansion material was circulated during the period from April 2015 to December
    2016. This document presents the approved report of the results of this comparison.</p><p>To
