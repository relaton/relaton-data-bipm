    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A regional key comparison on calibration of a line scale, APMP.L-K7 was conducted. KRISS acted as the pilot laboratory, and a total of 15 National Metrology Institutes, (10 from APMP, 3 from EURAMET, 1 from SIM, and 1 from AFRIMETS) have participated in this comparison, where a 500 mm line scale made of low thermal expansion material was circulated during the period from April 2015 to December 2016. This document presents the approved report of the results of this comparison.</p>
