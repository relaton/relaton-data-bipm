abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to
    water of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Canada and the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co
    radiation beam of the BIPM in October 2020. The comparison result, based on the
    calibration coefficients for three transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio
    of the NRC and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9995 with a
    combined standard uncertainty of 3.4 parts in 103. The result agrees within the
    uncertainties with the comparison carried out in 2009. The results are analysed
    and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM
    key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on
    Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM
    key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
