    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A new key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Canada and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in October 2020. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for three transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the NRC and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9995 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.4 parts in 103. The result agrees within the uncertainties with the comparison carried out in 2009. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
