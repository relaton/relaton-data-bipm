abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the
    National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Canada and the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam
    of the BIPM in October 2020. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients
    for three transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the NRC and the BIPM standards
    for air kerma, is 1.0022 with a combined standard uncertainty of 2.2 parts in
    103. The result agrees within the uncertainties with the indirect comparison carried
    out in 2009. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence,
    suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
