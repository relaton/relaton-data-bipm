    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group performed the APMP.RI(I)-K5 key comparison of the air kerma for 137Cs in 2014. Five national metrology institutes (NMIs) took part in the comparison. Two commercial ionization chambers were used as transfer instruments and circulated among the participants. The results showed that the maximum difference between the participants and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures, evaluated using the comparison data of the linking laboratories of the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science and the National Metrology Institute of Japan, was less than 0.5% within the expanded uncertainty. This comparison supports the equivalence of the calibration capabilities of the participating laboratories. The results predate the publication of ICRU report 90, therefore, the revision of the data reflecting the effects of the ICRU report 90 on the degrees of equivalences of the participant laboratories is presented in Appendix C.</p>
