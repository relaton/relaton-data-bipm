abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group performed the APMP.RI(I)-K5
    key comparison of the air kerma for 137Cs in 2014. Five national metrology institutes
    (NMIs) took part in the comparison. Two commercial ionization chambers were used
    as transfer instruments and circulated among the participants. The results showed
    that the maximum difference between the participants and the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures, evaluated using the comparison data of the linking laboratories
    of the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science and the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan, was less than 0.5% within the expanded uncertainty. This comparison
    supports the equivalence of the calibration capabilities of the participating
    laboratories. The results predate the publication of ICRU report 90, therefore,
    the revision of the data reflecting the effects of the ICRU report 90 on the degrees
    of equivalences of the participant laboratories is presented in Appendix C.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
