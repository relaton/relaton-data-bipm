    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>In 2016, comparisons of activity measurements of <sup>99m</sup>Tc, <sup>18</sup>F and <sup>64</sup>Cu using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the National Centre for Nuclear Research, Radioisotope Centre (POLATOM, Poland). Ampoules containing about 33 kBq of <sup>99m</sup>Tc, 28 kBq of <sup>18</sup>F and 110 kBq of <sup>64</sup>Cu solutions were measured in the SIRTI for about 3, 5 and 1.5 half-lives, respectively. The POLATOM standardized the activity in the ampoules by 4π(LS)β–γ coincidence measurements. The comparisons, identifiers BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m, BIPM.RI(II)-K4.F-18 and BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Cu-64, are linked to the corresponding BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m, BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18 and BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64 comparisons. The BIPM.RI(II)-K1 <sup>99m</sup>Tc and <sup>18</sup>F key comparison reference values have been updated to include the latest BIPM.RI(II)-K4 linked results and degrees of equivalence for both comparison series have been evaluated.</p>
