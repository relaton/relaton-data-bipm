abstract:
- content: Main text<p>In 2016, comparisons of activity measurements of<sup>99m</sup>Tc,<sup>18</sup>F
    and<sup>64</sup>Cu using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference
    System (SIRTI) took place at the National Centre for Nuclear Research, Radioisotope
    Centre (POLATOM, Poland). Ampoules containing about 33 kBq of<sup>99m</sup>Tc,
    28 kBq of<sup>18</sup>F and 110 kBq of<sup>64</sup>Cu solutions were measured
    in the SIRTI for about 3, 5 and 1.5 half-lives, respectively. The POLATOM standardized
    the activity in the ampoules by 4π(LS)β–γ coincidence measurements. The comparisons,
    identifiers BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m, BIPM.RI(II)-K4.F-18 and BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Cu-64,
    are linked to the corresponding BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m, BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18 and
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64 comparisons. The BIPM.RI(II)-K1<sup>99m</sup>Tc and<sup>18</sup>F
    key comparison reference values have been updated to include the latest BIPM.RI(II)-K4
    linked results and degrees of equivalence for both comparison series have been
    evaluated.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
