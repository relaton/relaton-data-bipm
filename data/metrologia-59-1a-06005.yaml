abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to
    water standards of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Canada and the
    BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement
    within the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 5.8 parts in 103. The results
    are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry
    in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
