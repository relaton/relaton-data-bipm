abstract:
- content: Main text<p>In 2009, the Consultative Committee for Ionizing Radiation
    (CCRI) approved its first supplementary comparison, to be organized by the ENEA
    (as the pilot laboratory), for the measurement of the alpha and beta particle
    surface (i.e. 2 solid angle) emission rate from large area sources of the type
    used for calibrating surface contamination monitors. Five sources were disseminated
    to the twenty-three participating laboratories consisting of one each of 241Am,
    14C, 147Pm and 90Sr for emission rate measurements, with one additional 90Sr source
    for the evaluation of source uniformity. Measurements of the radionuclide activity
    and radionuclidic purity were also made although not strictly required. This report
    describes the organization of this comparison and the material and measurement
    methods used. The proposed supplementary comparison reference values (SCRV) for
    each of the comparison measurands are given, together with the Degrees of Equivalence
    and their associated uncertainties for each participating laboratory. The results
    of this supplementary comparison may be used as evidence by participating National
    Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) when submitting calibration
    and measurement capabilities (CMCs) for the given radionuclides for similar types
    of large area sources; this is an important aspect of this comparison, given that
    only one other international supplementary comparison for surface emission rates
    had been organized before.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on

    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
