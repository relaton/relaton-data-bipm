abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Since 1979, 8 laboratories have submitted 20 samples of<sup>201</sup>Tl
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifer BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tl-201.
    The NIST (United States) participated in the comparison and the key comparison
    reference value (KCRV) has been updated. The degrees of equivalence between each
    equivalent activity measured in the SIR and the updated KCRV have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical presentation is
    also given.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
