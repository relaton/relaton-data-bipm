abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the KRISS, Republic of Korea, and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range.
    The results show the standards to be in agreement at the limit of the expanded
    uncertainty of the comparison of 4.4 parts in 103. The results are analysed and
    presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key
    comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
