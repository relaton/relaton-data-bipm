    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the KRISS, Republic of Korea, and the BIPM in the medium-energy x-ray range. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the limit of the expanded uncertainty of the comparison of 4.4 parts in 103. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
