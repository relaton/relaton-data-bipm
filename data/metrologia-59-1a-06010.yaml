abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to
    water standards of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, and
    the BIPM, in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be in
    agreement within the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 5.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>.
    The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable
    for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in
    Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
