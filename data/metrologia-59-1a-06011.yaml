abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the KRISS, Republic of Korea, and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The
    results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the standard uncertainty
    of the comparison of 2.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and
    presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry into the BIPM
    key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on
    Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM
    key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has
    been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
