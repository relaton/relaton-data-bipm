abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A supplementary comparison of standards for absorbed dose to
    water in<sup>60</sup>Co fields used for calibrations at radiation processing dose
    levels has been completed. Alanine dosimeters from the NIST and the NPL were used
    as transfer dosimeters and all participant irradiations were carried out in self-shielded
    irradiators. Irradiations were also carried out at the BIPM to allow direct comparison
    of dose ratios with the Key Comparison BIPM.RI(I)-K4. No significant difference
    was seen between the dose ratios obtained using the NPL and NIST alanine systems,
    no significant impact of mailing on dosimeter response was noted, and the adopted
    protocol limited any dose rate effects to the level of Type A uncertainties. The
    national standards of the participants are in agreement within the standard uncertainties,
    which are in the range from 1 to 2 parts in 10<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>To reach the
    main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which
    appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
