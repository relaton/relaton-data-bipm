    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China, and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in December 2021. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for four transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the NIM and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 1.0027 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
