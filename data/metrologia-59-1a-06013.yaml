abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water
    of the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China, and the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam
    of the BIPM in December 2021. The comparison result, based on the calibration
    coefficients for four transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the NIM and
    the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 1.0027 with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 3.6 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
    that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
