abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the GUM, Poland, and the BIPM in the low-energy x-ray range. The results show
    the standards to be in agreement at the level of the expanded uncertainty of the
    comparison of 5.8 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
    that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
