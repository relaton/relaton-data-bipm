abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Three new participations in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-57 comparison
    have been added to the previous results and this has produced a revised value
    for the key comparison reference value (KCRV), calculated using the power-moderated
    weighted mean. A link has been made to the CCRI(II)-S6.Co-57 comparison piloted
    by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2008 for which one sample
    of the<sup>57</sup>Co radioactive solution was sent to the SIR. Two NMIs used
    the S6 comparison to update their degree of equivalence. The degrees of equivalence
    between each equivalent activity measured in the International Reference System
    (SIR) and the KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form
    of a table for the remaining seven NMIs in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Co-57 comparison
    and the three eligible participants in the CCRI(II)-S6.Co-57 comparison. A graphical
    presentation is also given.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
