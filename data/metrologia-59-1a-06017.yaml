abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the
    National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), Japan, and the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam
    of the BIPM in February 2022. The comparison result, based on the calibration
    coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the NMIJ and
    the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0013 with a combined standard uncertainty
    of 2.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties with
    the direct comparison carried out in 2012. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
    that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
