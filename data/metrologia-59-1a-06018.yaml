    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Republic of Korea, and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in March 2022. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of the KRISS and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0006 with a combined standard uncertainty of 1.8 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties with the direct comparison carried out in 2010. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
