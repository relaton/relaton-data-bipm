abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A new key comparison of the standards for air kerma of the
    Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Republic of Korea,
    and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the<sup>60</sup>Co
    radiation beam of the BIPM in March 2022. The comparison result, based on the
    calibration coefficients for two transfer chambers and expressed as a ratio of
    the KRISS and the BIPM standards for air kerma, is 1.0006 with a combined standard
    uncertainty of 1.8 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties
    with the direct comparison carried out in 2010. The results are analysed and presented
    in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison
    database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
    that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
