    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Since 1977, 23 laboratories have submitted 45 samples of <sup>133</sup>Ba to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133. Recently, the NRC (Canada), the TENMAK-NÜKEN (Türkiye), the NMISA (South Africa) and the NIST (United States) participated in the comparison and the key comparison reference value (KCRV) has been updated. The degrees of equivalence between the updated KCRV and each equivalent activity measured in the SIR or linked to the SIR from the APMP.RI(II)-K2.Ba-133 comparison have been calculated and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical representation is also given.</p>
