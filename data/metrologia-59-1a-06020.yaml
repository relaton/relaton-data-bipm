abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Since 1977, 23 laboratories have submitted 45 samples of<sup>133</sup>Ba
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ba-133.
    Recently, the NRC (Canada), the TENMAK-NÜKEN (Türkiye), the NMISA (South Africa)
    and the NIST (United States) participated in the comparison and the key comparison
    reference value (KCRV) has been updated. The degrees of equivalence between the
    updated KCRV and each equivalent activity measured in the SIR or linked to the
    SIR from the APMP.RI(II)-K2.Ba-133 comparison have been calculated and the results
    are given in the form of a table. A graphical representation is also given.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
