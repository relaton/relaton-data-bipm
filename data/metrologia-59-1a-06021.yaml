abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This is the final report for the EURAMET.RI(II)-K2.Ho-166 key
    comparison of the activity of the radionuclide<sup>166</sup>Ho per unit mass of
    aqueous solution which was organized in 2017 by Czech Metrology Institute (CMI)
    within the joint research project "Metrology for clinical implementation of dosimetry
    in molecular radiotherapy" (MRTDosimetry; 15HLT06) of the European Metrology Programme
    for Innovation and Research (EMPIR). The key comparison reference value of (2623.6
    ± 3.6) kBq·g<sup>-1</sup> was determined from the results of three participants
    at the reference time of 1 December 2017 00:00 UTC. The details of the comparison
    are presented and analysed in this paper.</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
