    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This is the final report for the EURAMET.RI(II)-K2.Ho-166 key comparison of the activity of the radionuclide <sup>166</sup>Ho per unit mass of aqueous solution which was organized in 2017 by Czech Metrology Institute (CMI) within the joint research project "Metrology for clinical implementation of dosimetry in molecular radiotherapy" (MRTDosimetry; 15HLT06) of the European Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR). The key comparison reference value of (2623.6 ± 3.6) kBq·g<sup>-1</sup> was determined from the results of three participants at the reference time of 1 December 2017 00:00 UTC. The details of the comparison are presented and analysed in this paper.</p>
