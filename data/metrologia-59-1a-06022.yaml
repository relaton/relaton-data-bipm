    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the ARPANSA, Australia, and the BIPM in the low-energy x ray range. The results show the standards to agree at the level of the expanded uncertainty of the comparison of 9 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> (22 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> at 10 kV). The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
