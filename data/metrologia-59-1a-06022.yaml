abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards
    of the ARPANSA, Australia, and the BIPM in the low-energy x ray range. The results
    show the standards to agree at the level of the expanded uncertainty of the comparison
    of 9 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> (22 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> at 10 kV). The results
    are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry
    in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
