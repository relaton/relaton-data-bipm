abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A first key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to
    water of the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS), Republic
    of Korea, and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried
    out in the<sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in March 2022. The comparison
    result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and evaluated
    as a ratio of the KRISS and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is
    0.9986 with a combined standard uncertainty of 3.8 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The
    results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable
    for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in
    Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
