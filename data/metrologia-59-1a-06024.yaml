abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma
    standards of the KRISS, Republic of Korea, and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams.
    The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the expanded
    uncertainty for the comparison of 4.4 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are
    analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry
    in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
