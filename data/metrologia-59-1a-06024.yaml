    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A first key comparison has been made between the air-kerma standards of the KRISS, Republic of Korea, and the BIPM in mammography x-ray beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement at the level of the expanded uncertainty for the comparison of 4.4 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
