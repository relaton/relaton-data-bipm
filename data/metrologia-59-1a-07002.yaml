    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This bilateral comparison of Force Standard Machines (FSM) named AFRIMETS.M. F-S1 was carried out in the force range from 1 kN to 100 kN between Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) of Germany as the pilot laboratory and Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of Kenya as the participant laboratory. KEBS had already participated in the APMP.M. F-K2 key comparison where measurements were made only at 50 kN and 100 kN force steps. Therefore, this bilateral comparison was planned to thoroughly compare the KEBS FSM and the PTB Deadweight Machines in wider force steps than those of the APMP.M. F-K2 key comparison and thus it had no corresponding key-comparisons values to be linked to at that time. PTB provided two force transducers for the supplementary comparison with 10 kN and 100 kN nominal capacities. The comparison method called "DKD" procedure was used. This procedure has already been used in several comparisons in Germany and other countries. The purpose to this comparison is to give support to the uncertainty claims for KEBS and will be used to determine the Calibration and Measurement Capability (CMC). In addition, this comparison will provide metrological proof of the application for a CMC entry in the BIPM Key Comparison Database (KCDB). This report describes the scheme and results of the comparison.</p>
