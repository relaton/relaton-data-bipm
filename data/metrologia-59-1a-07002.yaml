abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This bilateral comparison of Force Standard Machines (FSM)
    named AFRIMETS.M. F-S1 was carried out in the force range from 1 kN to 100 kN
    between Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) of Germany as the pilot laboratory
    and Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of Kenya as the participant laboratory. KEBS
    had already participated in the APMP.M. F-K2 key comparison where measurements
    were made only at 50 kN and 100 kN force steps. Therefore, this bilateral comparison
    was planned to thoroughly compare the KEBS FSM and the PTB Deadweight Machines
    in wider force steps than those of the APMP.M. F-K2 key comparison and thus it
    had no corresponding key-comparisons values to be linked to at that time. PTB
    provided two force transducers for the supplementary comparison with 10 kN and
    100 kN nominal capacities. The comparison method called "DKD" procedure was used.
    This procedure has already been used in several comparisons in Germany and other
    countries. The purpose to this comparison is to give support to the uncertainty
    claims for KEBS and will be used to determine the Calibration and Measurement
    Capability (CMC). In addition, this comparison will provide metrological proof
    of the application for a CMC entry in the BIPM Key Comparison Database (KCDB).
    This report describes the scheme and results of the comparison.</p><p>To reach

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
