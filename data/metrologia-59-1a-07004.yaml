abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>A supplementary comparison, entitled as APMP.M.FF-S1, has
    been undertaken between KRISS and NMIJ, AIST under the supervision by the Technical
    Committee for Fluid Flow (TCFF) in the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP).
    The purpose of this supplementary comparison was to prove the measurement equivalence
    between NMIJ, AIST and KRISS for water flow measurement standards from 300 m<sup>3</sup>/h
    to 1 200 m<sup>3</sup>/h. This supplementary comparison was meaningful because
    there has not been an international comparison for water flows greater than 300
    m<sup>3</sup>/h. Previous key comparisons have been performed only from 30 m<sup>3</sup>/h
    to 200 m<sup>3</sup>/h [1]. Therefore, this supplementary comparison became the
    first inter-laboratory comparison to cover the flow range for large-capacity water
    flow measurement standards. In fact, the inter-laboratory comparison between NMIJ,
    AIST and PTB (Berlin) has been already done for such flowrate range [2], however,
    this inter-laboratory comparison has not been supervised by APMP or EURAMET, such
    that the result of inter-laboratory comparison is published in a research journal,
    not in the BIPM KCDB for inter-laboratory comparisons.</p><p>A turbine flow meter
    with the pipe diameter of 250 mm was chosen as a transfer standard in this supplementary
    comparison. A flow conditioner was used to define inflow conditions upstream of
    the turbine flow meter. The flow conditioner was a perforated plate with a well-known
    design. The turbine flow meter was calibrated in two ways: with or without the
    flow conditioner. The calibration of turbine flow meter with the flow conditioner
    was according to the revised test protocol for this supplementary comparison.
    The other calibration without the flow conditioner was performed to investigate
    the flow characteristics of the turbine flow meter.</p><p>K-factor was the measurand
    to evaluate the measurement equivalence between NMIJ, AIST and KRISS. The K-factor
    was corrected by considering the temperature change between the water temperature
    and the reference temperature of 20<sup>o</sup>C [3]. The measurement uncertainty
    of the K-factor included uncertainty factors such as repeatability, day-to-day
    reproducibility, re-installation effect, long-term stability, and the influence
    by temperature change. Inconclusiveness test was also performed to see whether
    the K-factor was suitable for evaluating the number of equivalence between NMIJ,
    AIST and KRISS. The number of equivalence was found to be less than 1. The number
    of equivalence became better in the case without the flow conditioner than the
    case with the flow conditioner. The number of equivalence was found to be conclusive
    because the inconclusiveness index was less than 2. Therefore, the measurement
    equivalence between NMIJ, AIST and KRISS has been proven by this supplementary
    comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.

    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
