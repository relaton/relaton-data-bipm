abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>This report presents the results of the key comparison EURAMET.M.D-K4.2020
    (EURAMET 1496) that covered the calibration of high-resolution hydrometers for
    liquid in the density range 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at the
    reference temperature of 20<sup>o</sup>C. Nine laboratories participated in this
    key comparison, eight European national metrology institutes and one from Asia
    Pacific metrology: NIM from China. The participating laboratories were initially
    divided into two petals linked by two density laboratories: INRIM and PTB. In
    each petal, four similar transfer standards, hydrometers in the density range
    600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> are used.</p><p>The equipment used
    by the participants was found to have very similar characteristics. Most of the
    declared relative uncertainties were within the 5x10<sup>-5</sup>.</p><p>The results
    of all participated laboratories have been linked to the CIPM key comparison CCM.D-K4
    by INRIM and PTB. Discrepant results have been reported for three laboratories,
    which, however, do not affect their CMCs.</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
