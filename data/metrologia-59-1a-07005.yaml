    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report presents the results of the key comparison EURAMET.M.D-K4.2020 (EURAMET 1496) that covered the calibration of high-resolution hydrometers for liquid in the density range 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> at the reference temperature of 20 <sup>o</sup>C. Nine laboratories participated in this key comparison, eight European national metrology institutes and one from Asia Pacific metrology: NIM from China. The participating laboratories were initially divided into two petals linked by two density laboratories: INRIM and PTB. In each petal, four similar transfer standards, hydrometers in the density range 600 kg/m<sup>3</sup> to 2000 kg/m<sup>3</sup> are used.</p>
    <p>The equipment used by the participants was found to have very similar characteristics. Most of the declared relative uncertainties were within the 5x10<sup>-5</sup>.</p>
    <p>The results of all participated laboratories have been linked to the CIPM key comparison CCM.D-K4 by INRIM and PTB. Discrepant results have been reported for three laboratories, which, however, do not affect their CMCs.</p>
