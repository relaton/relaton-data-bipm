    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report shows the final results of the bilateral comparison SIM.M.P-S8 between the Custodian Laboratory of National Pressure Standards of Chile, LCPN-P (with the National Aeronautics Company - ENAER) and the National Institute of Technology, Standardization and Metrology, INTN of Paraguay, in the field of hydraulic pressure up to 70 MPa. The comparison was carried out between December 2011 and May 2012. Each laboratory used a pressure balance as a reference standard covering the range from 7 MPa to 70 MPa for the comparison. The transfer standard for the comparison was a digital manometer OMEGA, PCL-3000-4 with an accuracy of 0.05 % of full scale and a resolution of 0.01 MPa.</p>
    <p>The pilot laboratory, LCPN-P, provided the transfer standard and made the analysis of the results, while the reference value was provided by INTN Paraguay.</p>
    <p>An analysis of compatibility between the results of the present bilateral comparison and the supplementary comparison SIM.M.P-S7 was made, obtaining satisfactory results, which enables a link between both comparisons.</p>
