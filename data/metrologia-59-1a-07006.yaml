abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report shows the final results of the bilateral comparison
    SIM.M.P-S8 between the Custodian Laboratory of National Pressure Standards of
    Chile, LCPN-P (with the National Aeronautics Company - ENAER) and the National
    Institute of Technology, Standardization and Metrology, INTN of Paraguay, in the
    field of hydraulic pressure up to 70 MPa. The comparison was carried out between
    December 2011 and May 2012. Each laboratory used a pressure balance as a reference
    standard covering the range from 7 MPa to 70 MPa for the comparison. The transfer
    standard for the comparison was a digital manometer OMEGA, PCL-3000-4 with an
    accuracy of 0.05 % of full scale and a resolution of 0.01 MPa.</p><p>The pilot
    laboratory, LCPN-P, provided the transfer standard and made the analysis of the
    results, while the reference value was provided by INTN Paraguay.</p><p>An analysis
    of compatibility between the results of the present bilateral comparison and the
    supplementary comparison SIM.M.P-S7 was made, obtaining satisfactory results,
    which enables a link between both comparisons.</p><p>To reach the main text of
    this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in
    Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
