abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report describes a CIPM Key Comparison through the SIM/MWG-7
    organization, concerning instrumented impact testing of low-energy (20 J) and
    high-energy (100 J) Charpy V-notch specimens.</p><p>In this Comparison, various
    instrumented and non-instrumented data were obtained from instrumented Charpy
    tests performed at the pilot (NIST) and participant (INMETRO) laboratories using
    the same instrumented Charpy striker and acquisition system.</p><p>The use of
    instrumented absorbed energy (Wt), rather than absorbed energy yielded by the
    impact machine encoder or dial gage (KV), guarantees traceability to the International
    System and offers the promise of reducing bias between NMIs and simplifying comparisons
    between certification systems.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
