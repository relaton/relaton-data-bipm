    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report describes a CIPM Key Comparison through the SIM/MWG-7 organization, concerning instrumented impact testing of low-energy (20 J) and high-energy (100 J) Charpy V-notch specimens.</p>
    <p>In this Comparison, various instrumented and non-instrumented data were obtained from instrumented Charpy tests performed at the pilot (NIST) and participant (INMETRO) laboratories using the same instrumented Charpy striker and acquisition system.</p>
    <p>The use of instrumented absorbed energy (Wt), rather than absorbed energy yielded by the impact machine encoder or dial gage (KV), guarantees traceability to the International System and offers the promise of reducing bias between NMIs and simplifying comparisons between certification systems.</p>
