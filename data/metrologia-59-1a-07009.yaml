abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A supplementary comparison for hydrometer calibration using
    Cuckow's method was proposed during the 10th AFRIMETS Committee for Mass and Related
    Quantities (TCM) meeting held at the National Institute of Standards (NIS, Egypt).
    Two laboratories only from AFRIMETS, NIS and the National Metrology Institute
    of South Africa (NMISA), had the capacity to participate in the comparison. Generously,
    Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM, Mexico) accepted to participate in the comparison
    and provided reference values. This comparison, designated as AFRIMETS.M.D-S4,
    was coordinated by the NIS supported by all participants. The corrections to be
    applied to three stated scale readings at 20 °C of different transfer standards
    in the density range between 0.600 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to 1.300 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
    were determined. NIS carried out the measurement at the beginning and at the end
    of the comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final

    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
