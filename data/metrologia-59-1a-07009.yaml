    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A supplementary comparison for hydrometer calibration using Cuckow's method was proposed during the 10th AFRIMETS Committee for Mass and Related Quantities (TCM) meeting held at the National Institute of Standards (NIS, Egypt). Two laboratories only from AFRIMETS, NIS and the National Metrology Institute of South Africa (NMISA), had the capacity to participate in the comparison. Generously, Centro Nacional de Metrologia (CENAM, Mexico) accepted to participate in the comparison and provided reference values. This comparison, designated as AFRIMETS.M.D-S4, was coordinated by the NIS supported by all participants. The corrections to be applied to three stated scale readings at 20 °C of different transfer standards in the density range between 0.600 g/cm<sup>3</sup> to 1.300 g/cm<sup>3</sup> were determined. NIS carried out the measurement at the beginning and at the end of the comparison.</p>
