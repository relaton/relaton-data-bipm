    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The purpose of the Supplementary Comparison (S13) for water flow measurement (EURAMET 1473 and EURAMET.M.FF-S13) is to support the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMC) entry of VTT MIKES, the National Metrology Institute of Finland. For this goal, a bilateral comparison between VTT MIKES and PTB Braunschweig was realized. The laboratory "Hydrodynamic Test Field" of department 1.5 "Liquid Flow" acted as the reference facility. The results of the comparison showed good equivalencies and supports the CMC claim of VTT MIKES.</p>
