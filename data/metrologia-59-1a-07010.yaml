abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The purpose of the Supplementary Comparison (S13) for water
    flow measurement (EURAMET 1473 and EURAMET.M.FF-S13) is to support the Calibration
    and Measurement Capabilities (CMC) entry of VTT MIKES, the National Metrology
    Institute of Finland. For this goal, a bilateral comparison between VTT MIKES
    and PTB Braunschweig was realized. The laboratory "Hydrodynamic Test Field" of
    department 1.5 "Liquid Flow" acted as the reference facility. The results of the
    comparison showed good equivalencies and supports the CMC claim of VTT MIKES.</p><p>To
