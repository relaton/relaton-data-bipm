abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The CCM.FF-K6.2017 comparison was organised for the purpose
    of determination of the degree of equivalence of the national standards for low-pressure
    gas flow measurement over the range 2 mL/min to 10 L/min. Four molbloc-L flow
    elements and a molbox1+ were used as the transfer standards.</p><p>Ten laboratories
    from three RMOs participated between August 2017 and January 2020 - EURAMET: INRIM
    (Italy); LNE (France); PTB (Germany); METAS (Switzerland); CMI (Czech Republic);
    SIM: NIST (USA); APMP: NMIJ/AIST (Japan); KRISS (Korea); NMIA (Australia); CMS
    (Chinese Taipei). The measurements were provided at prescribed reference pressure
    and temperature conditions. All results were used in the determination of the
    key comparison reference value (KCRV) and the uncertainty of the KCRV. The reference
    value was determined at each flow separately following the procedure presented
    by M G Cox [1]. The degree of equivalence with the KCRV was calculated for each
    flow and laboratory. This KCRV can now be used in further regional comparisons.</p><p>To

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
