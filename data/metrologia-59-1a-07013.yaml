abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The objective of the Key Comparison CCM.FF-K1.2015 for water
    flow measurement was to support and prove the Calibration and Measurement Capabilities
    (CMC) of the participating NMIs of Japan (AIST), Mexico (CENAM), Chinese Taipei
    (ITRI), Korea (KRISS), P.R. China (NIM), Germany (PTB), USA (NIST), Sweden (RISE),
    UK (NEL), Turkey (TUBITAK UME) and Netherlands (VSL). The comparison was organized
    as a round robin, started in December 2015 at PTB and finished in April 2018,
    also at PTB. As pilot laboratory, the national metrology institute of Germany
    (PTB) organised the comparison. A combined setup of a turbine meter and Coriolis
    meter was used as a transfer standard (TS), which was provided by the pilot laboratory.
    The nominal calibration conditions of the KC were defined within the flow range
    between 30 m<sup>3</sup>/h and 200 m<sup>3</sup>/h, 20 °C fluid temperature and
    3 bar line pressure.</p><p>A special focus of the comparison was to estimate the
    uncertainties of the transfer standard (u<sub>TS</sub>). Both transfer meters
    were subjected to extensive characterization measurements at pilot laboratory,
    with the following investigated parameters: fluid temperature, line pressure,
    repeatability, flow stability, meter sensitivity to varying inflow conditions
    and hysteresis effects.</p><p>For turbine meter, all labs passed the E<sub>N</sub>
    criteria of ≤ 1.20. The calibrations of the turbine meter were strongly affected
    by the presence of the large values for u<sub>TS</sub> with &gt; 0.12 % k =1)
    which were mainly caused by the meter sensitivity to disturbed inflow conditions.
    This effect led to inconclusive calibration results for all laboratories. The
    evaluation criteria u<sub>comp</sub>/u<sub>base</sub> exceeded the critical value
    of 2.00. Finally, the turbine meter was not suitable for a confirmation of all
    submitted CMC values.</p><p>For Coriolis meter, all labs passed the E<sub>N</sub>
    criteria of ≤ 1.20. In contrast to turbine meter, the evaluation criteria u<sub>comp</sub>/u<sub>base</sub>
    exceeded the critical value of 2.00 for one laboratory, only. The maximum uncertainty
    u<sub>TS</sub> of Coriolis meter was estimated with 0.022 % (k =1).</p><p>In summary,
    the comparison was successfully finished for a confirmation of the submitted CMC
    values, related to mass calibrations. For volume related CMCs this comparison
    was not suitable.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
