abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The purpose of this comparison, SIM.M.T-S1, was to determine
    the results agreement of torque transducer calibration measurements between the
    two participating laboratories. The data evaluated in this comparison was the
    average reading and the uncertainty of the instrument under calibration for each
    torque target point. Clockwise and counter clockwise values were evaluated separately.</p><p>To

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
