abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>This report describes the results of a key comparison among
    hydraulic high pressure standards that have been maintained by seven National
    Metrology Institutes (NMIs: NIMT, NMIJ/AIST, NPLI, RCM-LIPI, NMIM, VMI and NMLPHIL).
    This comparison was carried out during the period March 2016 to October 2017 within
    the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) in order to determine
    their degrees of equivalence in the pressure range from 10 MPa to 100 MPa, gauge
    mode. The pilot institute was the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand) (NIMT).
    All participating institutes used hydraulic pressure balance as their pressure
    standards. In order to ensure reliability, two high precision pressure transducers
    were used as the transfer standard. The sensing element of the transducers was
    a precision quartz crystal resonator attached to a small Bourdon tube. During
    the comparison, the transfer standard was calibrated at the pilot institute two
    times, before and after circulating the transfer standard to participants. From
    the two NIMT calibration results, the transfer standard was sufficiently stable
    to meet the requirements of the comparison. The long-term instability obtained
    from the two calibration results was taken into account as the uncertainty of
    the transfer standard for all participants. As the matter of fact NPL India and
    NMIM participated in this comparison as one of the linkage institutes and participating
    institutes, respectively. However, it was found later that the systems of hydraulic
    pressure balance reference standards used in this comparison were not functioning.
    Therefore, the comparison results were withdrawn. The degrees of equivalence of
    each national measurement standard were expressed quantitatively by deviations
    from the key comparison reference value of the corresponding CCM key comparison,
    CCM.P-K7 through the linkage institute, NMIJ/AIST. In conclusion, the hydraulic
    pressure standards in the range 10 MPa to 100 MPa, gauge mode of the five participating
    NMIs were found to be equivalent within their claimed uncertainties.</p><p>To
