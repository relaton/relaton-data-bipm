    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This key comparison is based on a decision of TCM of AFRIMETS on July 2015 in South Africa. TCM agreed that NIS-Egypt will pilot this comparison by providing the technical support and contributing to the link to the CCM comparison. The comparison consisted of one set of five stainless steel mass standards with nominal values: 5 kg, 100 g, 10 g, 5 g and 500 mg. These masses are owned by the LPEE-LNM and chosen to be the transfer mass standards. The pilot laboratory (NIS) measured the volume and the magnetic properties of the standards before the circulation and had reported these values to the participants. The pilot laboratory has also verified the stability of all travelling standards for one year.</p>
    <p>Six laboratories measured the set of travelling standards between September 2018 and December 2019.</p>
