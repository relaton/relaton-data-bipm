abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>This key comparison is based on a decision of TCM of AFRIMETS
    on July 2015 in South Africa. TCM agreed that NIS-Egypt will pilot this comparison
    by providing the technical support and contributing to the link to the CCM comparison.
    The comparison consisted of one set of five stainless steel mass standards with
    nominal values: 5 kg, 100 g, 10 g, 5 g and 500 mg. These masses are owned by the
    LPEE-LNM and chosen to be the transfer mass standards. The pilot laboratory (NIS)
    measured the volume and the magnetic properties of the standards before the circulation
    and had reported these values to the participants. The pilot laboratory has also
    verified the stability of all travelling standards for one year.</p><p>Six laboratories
    measured the set of travelling standards between September 2018 and December 2019.</p><p>To

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
