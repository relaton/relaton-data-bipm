    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>In order to demonstrate the equivalence in calibration of sub-multiples of the kilogram (200 g, 20 g, 2g, 200 mg), a supplementary comparison has been carried out by 6 members of EURAMET. The overall result shows a good agreement among participants with two discrepant results at 200 g and one for 2 g.</p>
