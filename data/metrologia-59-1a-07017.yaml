abstract:
- content: Main text<p>In order to demonstrate the equivalence in calibration of sub-multiples
    of the kilogram (200 g, 20 g, 2g, 200 mg), a supplementary comparison has been
    carried out by 6 members of EURAMET. The overall result shows a good agreement
    among participants with two discrepant results at 200 g and one for 2 g.</p><p>To
