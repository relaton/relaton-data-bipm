abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The high accuracy hydrometer comparison is intended to be a
    regional supplementary comparison according to the Mutual Recognition Arrangements
    and be a support to entries for the CMC tables in this sub-field for participant
    laboratories.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
