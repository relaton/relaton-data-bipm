    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report purposed the results of supplementary comparison of Brinell hardness, APMP.M.H-S5, among three National Metrology Institutes (NIMT, NMIJ/AIST and KRISS). The comparison was carried out during April 2018 to July 2019 in order to determine the capability of the primary Brinell hardness standard, including standard conditions, of each participant, to confirm the accuracy of Brinell hardness scale HBW 10/500 and HBW 10/3000 measurement declared by each participant, which includes the effect of each participant's primary indenter, and determine the degrees of equivalence of hardness scale measurement in the range 45HBW to 550HBW. The pilot institute was the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand), NIMT. There were 2 different types of artifacts for the comparison. The first set was the set of Brinell hardness comparison: hardness measurement. The second set is a set of diameter length comparison: diameter length measurement.</p>
    <p>The measurement results of each participant were used to compute the degree of equivalence in comparison reference value (CRV) and the uncertainty of this deviation at a 95% level of confidence. The E<sub>n</sub> number was calculated to express the equivalence between the measurements of participants as well.</p>
