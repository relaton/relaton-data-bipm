abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>This report purposed the results of supplementary comparison
    of Vickers hardness, APMP.M.H-S6, among five National Metrology Institutes (NIMT,
    NMIJ/AIST, KRISS, CMS/ITRI and SASO-NMCC). The comparison was carried out during
    November 2015 to January 2019 in order to determine the capability of the primary
    Vickers hardness standard, including standard conditions of each participant,
    to confirm the accuracy of Vickers hardness scale HV5, HV10, HV20, HV30, HV50
    and HV100 measurement declared by each participant, which includes the effect
    of each participant''s primary indenter, and determine the degrees of equivalence
    of hardness scale measurement in the range 100HV to 900HV. The pilot institute
    was the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand), NIMT. There were 2 different
    types of artifacts for the comparison. The first and second set were the set of
    Vickers hardness comparison: hardness measurement. The third set is a set of diagonal
    length comparison: diagonal length measurement.</p><p>The measurement results
    of each participant were used to compute the degree of equivalence in comparison
    reference value (CRV) and the uncertainty of this deviation at a 95% level of
    confidence. The E<sub>n</sub> parameter was calculated to express the equivalence
    between the measurements of participants as well.</p><p>To reach the main text

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database  https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
