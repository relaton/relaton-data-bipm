    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report purposed the results of supplementary comparison of Vickers hardness, APMP.M.H-S6, among five National Metrology Institutes (NIMT, NMIJ/AIST, KRISS, CMS/ITRI and SASO-NMCC). The comparison was carried out during November 2015 to January 2019 in order to determine the capability of the primary Vickers hardness standard, including standard conditions of each participant, to confirm the accuracy of Vickers hardness scale HV5, HV10, HV20, HV30, HV50 and HV100 measurement declared by each participant, which includes the effect of each participant's primary indenter, and determine the degrees of equivalence of hardness scale measurement in the range 100HV to 900HV. The pilot institute was the National Institute of Metrology (Thailand), NIMT. There were 2 different types of artifacts for the comparison. The first and second set were the set of Vickers hardness comparison: hardness measurement. The third set is a set of diagonal length comparison: diagonal length measurement.</p>
    <p>The measurement results of each participant were used to compute the degree of equivalence in comparison reference value (CRV) and the uncertainty of this deviation at a 95% level of confidence. The E<sub>n</sub> parameter was calculated to express the equivalence between the measurements of participants as well.</p>
