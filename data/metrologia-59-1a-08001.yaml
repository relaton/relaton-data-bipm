abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Under the auspices of the Protein Analysis Working Group (PAWG)
    of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a pilot study, CCQM-P216,
    was coordinated by the Chinese National Institute of Metrology (NIM), National
    Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM). Eleven Metrology Institutes or Designated Institutes and the BIPM participated
    in the first phase of the pilot study (Part 1). The purpose of this pilot study
    was to develop measurement capabilities for larger proteins using a recombinant
    humanized IgG monoclonal antibody against Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (Anti-S
    IgG mAb) in solution. The first phase of the study was designed to employ established
    methods that had been previously studies by the CCQM Protein Analysis Working
    Group, involving the digestion of protein down to the peptide or amino acid level.</p><p>The
    global coronavirus pandemic has also led to increased focus on antibody quantitation
    methods. IgG are among the immunoglobulins produced by the immune system to provide
    protection against SARS-CoV-2. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG can therefore be detected in
    samples from affected patients. Antibody tests can show whether a person has been
    exposed to the SARS-CoV-2, and whether or not they potentially show lasting immunity
    to the disease. With the constant spread of the virus and the high pressure of
    re-opening economies, antibody testing plays a critical role in the fight against
    COVID-19 by helping healthcare professionals to identify individuals who have
    developed an immune response, either via vaccination or exposure to the virus.
    Many countries have launched large-scale antibody testing for COVID-19. The development
    of measurement standards for the antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 is critically
    important to deal with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study,
    the SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody is being used as a model system to build capacity
    in methods that can be used in antibody quantification.</p><p>Amino acid reference
    values with corresponding expanded uncertainty of 36.10 ± 1.55 mg/kg, 38.75 ±
    1.45 mg/kg, 18.46 ± 0.78 mg/kg, 16.20 ± 0.67 mg/kg and 30.61 ± 1.30 mg/kg have
    been established for leucine, valine, phenylalanine, isoleucine and proline, respectively.
    Agreement between nearly all laboratories was achieved for the amino acid analysis
    within 2 to 2.5 %, with one participant achieving markedly higher results due
    to a technical issue found in their procedure; this result was thus excluded from
    the reference value calculations. The relatively good agreement within a laboratory
    between different amino acids was not dissimilar to previous results for peptides
    or small proteins, indicating that factors such as hydrolysis conditions and calibration
    procedures could be the largest sources of variability.</p><p>Peptide reference
    values with corresponding expanded uncertainty of 4.99 ± 0.28 mg/kg and 6.83 ±
    0.65 mg/kg have been established for ALPAPIEK and GPSVFPLAPSSK, respectively.
    Not surprisingly due to prior knowledge from previous studies on peptide quantitation,
    agreement between laboratories for the peptide-based analysis was slightly poorer
    at 3 to 5 %, with one laboratory's result excluded for the peptide GPSVFPLAPSSK.
    Again, this level of agreement was not significantly poorer than that achieved
    in previous studies with smaller or less complex proteins.</p><p>To reach the
