abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM-K154.b comparison was coordinated by the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and the Chinese National Institute of Metrology (NIM)
    on behalf of the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif
    pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) for National Measurement Institutes (NMIs)
    and Designated Institutes (DIs) which provide measurement services in organic
    analysis under the 'Comité International des Poids et Mesures' Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (CIPM MRA) and/or have participated in the BIPM's Mycotoxin Metrology
    Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer (MMCBKT) project as part of its "Metrology
    for Safe Food and Feed in Developing Economies" Capacity Building Programme.</p><p>Gravimetrically-prepared
    solutions having an assigned mass fraction of specified organic analytes are routinely
    used to calibrate measurement processes for the quantification of the same analytes
    in matrix samples. Appropriate assignments of the property value and associated
    uncertainty of calibration solutions thus underpin the traceability of routine
    analysis and are critical for accurate measurements. Evidence of successful participation
    in relevant international comparisons is needed to document calibration and measurement
    capability claims (CMCs) made by national metrology institutes and designated
    institutes. In total, eleven NMIs/DIs participated in the Track C, Model II, Key
    Comparison CCQM-K154.b [Gravimetric preparation and value assignment of aflatoxin
    B1 (AfB1) in acetonitrile (ACN)] for emerging areas of global interest and innovation.
    Participants were requested to gravimetrically prepare calibration solutions and
    value assign the mass fractions, expressed in mg/kg, of aflatoxin B1 (AfB1) in
    the acetonitrile (ACN) solution. Study samples, with assigned values and associated
    uncertainties were prepared by the comparison participants and sent to the coordinating
    laboratory for comparison. The Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRVs), calculated
    form values measured by the coordinating laboratory based on calibrations obtained
    from independent gravimetrically prepared calibrant solutions, agreed with participants
    reported values, within their stated uncertainties.</p><p>AfB1 was selected to
    be representative of polar aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are a class of mycotoxins generally
    produced by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. It was anticipated to provide a challenge
    representative for the gravimetrical preparation and value assignment of calibration
    solutions in the mass fraction range of 2 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg of mycotoxins with
    broadly similar structural characteristics.</p><p>Nine participants of the MMCBKT
    programme were provided with a stock solution having a known AfB1 mass fraction
    and expanded uncertainty to use to gravimetrically prepare and value assign a
    calibration solution. Three NMIs/DIs also participated using their own calibration
    solutions. The use of in-house solutions required an additional capacity to undertake
    a fit-for-purpose purity assessment. NIM was the only NMI participating using
    both the MMCBKT based and their own in-house assigned solutions in order to connect
    the two different groups.</p><p>It was decided to propose separate KCRVs for each
    of the two ampoules provided by the participating NMIs/DIs based on the AfB1 mass
    fraction. This allowed participants to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation
    of the approaches used to gravimetrically prepare calibration solutions and to
    assess the AfB1 mass fraction.</p><p>The majority of the AfB1 mass fraction KCRVs
    (wKCRV) for CCQM-K154.b spanned a mass fraction range of 2.02 mg/kg to 31.57 mg/kg.
    The relative expanded uncertainties U(wKCRV) ranged from 0.69 % to 2.93 %.</p><p>Inspection
    of the degree of equivalence plots for the AfB1 mass fraction assignments in CCQM-K154.b
    indicated that there was an excellent agreement of results. Solely, the AfB1 mass
    fraction assignments of INRAP did not agree with the KCRVs. It was found that
    the samples were altered as a result of an acid contamination.</p><p>To reach
