abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM-K10.2018 comparison aimed to evaluate the capabilities
    of national metrology institutes (NMIs) to prepare and/or value assign primary
    reference mixtures containing benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, m-xylene
    and o-xylene (subsequently referred to as BTEX) in nitrogen. This key comparison
    was separated into two parallel studies. The first study, deemed the "gravimetric
    study", evaluated the level of compatibility of BTEX standards provided by NMIs.
    Seven participating laboratories each submitted one standard at nominal 5 nmol
    mol-1 BTEX in nitrogen. Comparison measurements were performed by the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from July to October 2018. The second
    study, deemed the "comparative study", compared the capabilities of NMIs to measure
    the amount fractions of BTEX in a mixture provided by NIST. NIST prepared one
    standard at nominal 5 nmol mol-1 BTEX in nitrogen, which was measured consecutively
    by three participating laboratories. The participants' measurements took place
    from August 2018 to March 2019. The comparison protocol adopted for CCQM-K10.2018
    was more challenging than for the original comparison, CCQM-K10 in 2001, and the
    results provide an extended evaluation of the level of compatibility of BTEX in
    nitrogen standards.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
