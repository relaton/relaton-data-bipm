    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The CCQM Isotope Ratio Working Group (IRWG) determined that an additional key comparison of carbon isotope delta measurements was required to capture the progress of this field. Vials containing 0.25 mg of vanillin were prepared at NRC, and evaluated for bottle-to-bottle homogeneity prior to distribution to the eight participating institutes. Participants were able to choose any suitable method and reference materials for carbon isotope delta measurements, and report a carbon isotope delta value and the associated uncertainty, and analysis details. To determine the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and its associated uncertainty, the NRC in collaboration with the NIST, developed a multivariate Bayesian random laboratory effects model, which also incorporates the uncertainty due to bottle-to-bottle homogeneity and any correlations between the reported results that arise due to the use of common reference materials. The KCRV for this study was determined to be -25.833 ‰ relative to the VPDB, with associated uncertainty of 0.028 ‰, and expanded uncertainty of 0.056 ‰ (k=2). All the results reported by the participants in this study were considered equivalent to the KCRV.</p>
