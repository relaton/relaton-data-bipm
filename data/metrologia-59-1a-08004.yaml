abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM Isotope Ratio Working Group (IRWG) determined that
    an additional key comparison of carbon isotope delta measurements was required
    to capture the progress of this field. Vials containing 0.25 mg of vanillin were
    prepared at NRC, and evaluated for bottle-to-bottle homogeneity prior to distribution
    to the eight participating institutes. Participants were able to choose any suitable
    method and reference materials for carbon isotope delta measurements, and report
    a carbon isotope delta value and the associated uncertainty, and analysis details.
    To determine the key comparison reference value (KCRV) and its associated uncertainty,
    the NRC in collaboration with the NIST, developed a multivariate Bayesian random
    laboratory effects model, which also incorporates the uncertainty due to bottle-to-bottle
    homogeneity and any correlations between the reported results that arise due to
    the use of common reference materials. The KCRV for this study was determined
    to be -25.833 ‰ relative to the VPDB, with associated uncertainty of 0.028 ‰,
    and expanded uncertainty of 0.056 ‰ (k=2). All the results reported by the participants
    in this study were considered equivalent to the KCRV.</p><p>To reach the main

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
