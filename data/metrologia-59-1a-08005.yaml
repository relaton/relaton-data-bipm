abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This pilot study was conducted in parallel to the key comparison
    CCQM-K167. Vials containing 0.25 mg of vanillin were prepared at NRC and distributed
    to four participating institutes. Institutes could choose any suitable reference
    materials and methodology to perform carbon isotope delta measurements. Participants
    reported analysis details, and a carbon isotope delta value and associated uncertainty
    for the vanillin sample. Each of the carbon isotope delta results of vanillin
    were compared to the KCRV established from CCQM-K167, and metrological compatibility
    to the KCRV was determined. Three expert laboratories participated in this study,
    and their reported results serve as a benchmark to compare the performance of
    all other participants to these world-class institutes.</p><p>To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCQM.</p>
