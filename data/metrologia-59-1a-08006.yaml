abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Under the auspices of the Protein Analysis Working Group (PAWG)
    of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a key comparison,
    CCQM-K115.c, was coordinated by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) of Singapore and the Chinese National
    Institute of Metrology (NIM). Nine Metrology Institutes or Designated Institutes
    and the BIPM participated. Participants were required to assign the mass fraction
    of the glycated hexapeptide of HbA1c (GE) present as the main component in the
    comparison sample for CCQM-K115.c. The comparison samples were prepared by HSA/BIPM
    from synthetic GE purchased from a commercial supplier and used as provided without
    further treatment or purification.</p><p>GE was selected to be representative
    of the performance of a laboratory's measurement capability for the purity assignment
    of chemically synthesized peptides of known sequence, without cross-links, up
    to 5 kDa and modification (mono-glycation). It was anticipated to provide an analytical
    measurement challenge representative for the value-assignment of compounds of
    broadly similar structural characteristics.</p><p>The majority of participants
    used amino acid analysis (PICAA) or quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (PICqNMR)
    spectroscopy with a correction for structurally-related peptide impurities approach
    as the amount of material that has been provided to each participant (25 mg) is
    insufficient to perform a full mass balance based characterization of the material
    by a participating laboratory. The coordinators, the BIPM, the HSA and the NIM,
    were the laboratories to use the mass balance approach as they had more material
    available.</p><p>It was decided to propose KCRVs for both the GE mass fraction
    and the mass fraction of the peptide-related impurities as indispensable contributor
    regardless of the use of PICAA, PICqNMR or mass balance to determine the GE purity.
    This allowed participants to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation
    of the approaches used to determine the GE mass fraction. In particular, it allows
    participants to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation of peptide-related
    impurity identification and quantification.</p><p>More detailed studies on the
    identification/quantification of peptide-related impurities revealed that the
    integrity of the impurity profile of the related peptide impurities obtained by
    the participant is crucial for the impact on accuracy of the GE mass fraction
    assignment.</p><p>The assessment of the mass fraction of peptide impurities is
    based on the assumption that that all results are directly taken for the calculation
    of the KCRVPepImp by use of random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird (DSL)
    variance-weighted mean). The KCRVPepImp of 45.4 mg/g is associated with a corresponding
    expanded uncertainty of 9.5 mg/g (k =2.26) providing a more realistic basis of
    evaluation for the capabilities of the participants to identify/quantify peptide-related
    impurities. Inspection of the degree of equivalence plots for the mass fraction
    of peptide impurities and additional information obtained from the peptide-related
    impurity profile indicates that in most cases the major related peptide impurities
    have been identified and quantified.</p><p>The approach selected to obtain a KCRVGE
    for the mass fraction of GE is based on the DerSimonian-Laird (DSL) variance-weighted
    mean. The DSL mean takes into account the uncertainties of the results while introducing
    sufficient excess variance to allow for their observed dispersion resulting in
    a larger expanded uncertainty U(KCRVGE). The KCRVGE for CCQM-K115.c is 628 mg/g
    with a corresponding expanded uncertainty of the KCRVGE of 27 mg/g (k =2.26).
    All GE mass fraction results are in agreement with the KCRVGE.</p><p>To reach

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
