abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Under the auspices of the Protein Analysis Working Group (PAWG)
    of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a pilot study, CCQM-P55.2.c,
    was coordinated by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), the Health
    Sciences Authority (HSA) of Singapore and the Chinese National Institute of Metrology
    (NIM). Three Metrology Institutes or Designated Institutes and the BIPM participated.
    Participants were required to assign the mass fraction of glycated hexapeptide
    of HbA1c (GE) present as the main component in the comparison sample for CCQM-P55.2.c.
    The comparison samples were prepared by HSA/BIPM from synthetic GE purchased from
    a commercial supplier and used as provided without further treatment or purification.</p><p>GE
    was selected to be representative of the performance of a laboratory's measurement
    capability for the purity assignment of chemically synthesized peptides of known
    sequence, without cross-links, up to 5 kDa and modification (mono-glycation).
    It was anticipated to provide an analytical measurement challenge representative
    for the value-assignment of compounds of broadly similar structural characteristics.</p><p>The
    majority of participants used amino acid analysis (PICAA) or quantitative nuclear
    magnetic resonance (PICqNMR) spectroscopy with a correction for structurally-related
    peptide impurities. It was decided to assign reference values (RVs) based on the
    KCRVs of CCQM-K115.c for both the GE mass fraction and the mass fraction of the
    peptide related impurities as indispensable contributor regardless of the use
    of PICAA, mass balance or any other approach to determine the GE purity. This
    allowed participants to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation of the
    approaches used to determine the GE mass fraction. In particular, it allows participants
    to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation of peptide related impurity
    identification and quantification.</p><p>More detailed studies on the identification/quantification
    of peptide related impurities revealed that the integrity of the impurity profile
    of the related peptide impurities obtained by the participant is crucial for the
    impact on accuracy of the GE mass fraction assignment.</p><p>The assessment of
    the mass fraction of peptide impurities is based on the assumption that all results
    are directly taken for the calculation of the RV<sub>PepImp</sub> by use of random-effects
    meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird (DSL) variance-weighted mean). The RV<sub>PepImp</sub>
    of 45.4 mg/g is associated with a corresponding expanded uncertainty of 9.5 mg/g
    (k =2.26) providing a more realistic basis of evaluation for the capabilities
    of the participants to identify/quantify peptide related impurities. Inspection
    of the degree of equivalence plots for the mass fraction of peptide impurities
    and additional information obtained from the peptide related impurity profile
    indicates that in all cases the major related peptide impurities have been identified
    and quantified.</p><p>The approach selected to obtain a RV<sub>GE</sub> for the
    mass fraction of GE is based on the DerSimonian-Laird (DSL) variance-weighted
    mean. The DSL mean takes into account the uncertainties of the results while introducing
    sufficient excess variance to allow for their observed dispersion resulting in
    a larger expanded uncertainty U(RV<sub>GE</sub>). The RV<sub>GE</sub> based on
    CCQM-K115.c is 628 mg/g with a corresponding expanded uncertainty of the RV<sub>GE</sub>
    of 27 mg/g (k =2.26). All GE mass fraction results are in agreement with the RV<sub>GE</sub>.</p><p>To

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
