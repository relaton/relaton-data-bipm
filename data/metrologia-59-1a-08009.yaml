abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The APMP.QM-S16 comparison was coordinated by the National
    Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) on behalf of the Technical Committee on Amount
    of Substance (TCQM) of the Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) and the Organic
    Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière
    (CCQM) for National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs)
    which provide measurement services in organic analysis under the 'Comité International
    des Poids et Mesures' Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p><p>Fipronil
    is a broad-spectrum insecticide attributed to the phenylpyrazole family. Due to
    its high toxicity to invertebrates and long persistence, it has been one of the
    most widely used insecticides to control household and agricultural pests since
    its appearance in the market. Fipronil has also shown genotoxicity and cytotoxicity
    to many vertebrate animals, like mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and so on. Moreover,
    fipronil could have negative effects on the liver, kidneys and thyroid glands
    of humans. Its oxidation metabolite is fipronil-sulfone that could induce even
    higher toxicity than fipronil. In 2017, a fipronil-in-egg scandal occurred in
    the European Union (EU) that involved more than 15 states. The detected concentration
    of the sum of fipronil and fipronil-sulfone was many times higher than the EU
    maximum residue limit in bird egg (5 μg/kg). Besides European countries, fipronil-contaminated
    eggs were also found in Asian areas like China, Hong Kong and South Korea. Systematic
    monitoring and control of pesticide residues are necessary to safeguard public
    health.</p><p>Fipronil-sulfone was selected to be representative of pesticide
    residues in this comparison. This study provides the means for assessing measurement
    capabilities for determination of low-polarity measurands in a procedure that
    requires extraction, clean-up, analytical separation, and selective detection
    in a food matrix. Generally, it provides a demonstration of a laboratory's capabilities
    in determining the medium molecular weight analytes (mass range 300-500) with
    low polarity (pKow &lt; -2) at mass fraction levels of 4 to 400 μg/kg in a high
    fat, high protein and low carbohydrate food matrix that falls within Sector 4
    of the AOAC Food-matrix Triangle.</p><p>Seven NMIs/DIs participated in the APMP.QM-S16
    comparison. Different methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, QuEChERS and SPE
    were applied in the sample pre-treatment and HPLC-MS/MS, HPLC-HRMS, and GC-MS/MS
    were applied for detection by the participants. Most participating laboratories
    applied isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) techniques with fipronil-sulfone-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>
    as internal standard, except EC-JRC-Geel which used matrix matched external calibration
    method. In the aspect of the traceability for the measurement results, most participants
    either used their own CRMs, other NMIs' CRMs or the pure materials assessed in-house
    to guarantee traceability to SI unit. One lab was excluded from the SCRV evaluation,
    as they did not meet the CIPM metrological traceability requirements. As a result,
    six sets of valid results were used for the estimation of the SCRV. Finally Hierarchical
    Bayes was considered to be the appropriate estimator to calculate SCRV, which
    was determined as 121.82 μg/kg with a standard uncertainty of 1.77 μg/kg. Inspection
    of the degree of equivalence plots for the fipronil-sulfone mass fraction assignments
    in APMP.QM-S16 indicated that there was excellent agreement of results.</p><p>To

    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
