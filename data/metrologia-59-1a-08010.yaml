abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>Cosmetics and personal care products are widely used globally.
    Although toxic elements are banned as intentional ingredients, they may exist
    as impurities either as contaminants in the raw ingredients, or as by-products
    of the manufacturing process. These toxic elements can accumulate in the body
    over time and cause adverse health effects. Different regions around the world
    have established relevant guidelines and regulations to safeguard the safety of
    consumers. Therefore, there is a need for metrology institutes to strengthen their
    measurement capabilities in this area.</p><p>The supplementary comparison APMP.QM-S17:
    Elements in Lipstick Material was coordinated by the Health Sciences Authority,
    Singapore. Four measurands (arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead) with maximum limits
    stated under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Guidelines on
    Limits of Contaminants for Cosmetics were chosen. Only one key comparison in the
    area of cosmetics (CCQM-K106: Lead, Arsenic and Mercury in Cosmetic Cream) was
    organised by the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) China in 2013. Hence, it
    was timely to organise another comparison in this area that covered cosmetics
    but in a different matrix. The study sample (lipstick) offered different analytical
    challenges as compared to the cream material used in the previous comparison.
    Moreover, it enabled National Metrology Institutes/Designated Institutes (NMIs/DIs)
    that did not participate in CCQM-K106 to demonstrate their measurement competencies.</p><p>Seven
    institutes participated in the comparison for arsenic, nine for cadmium and lead,
    and eight for mercury. All participating NMIs/DIs employed microwave-assisted
    acid digestion for sample dissolution. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
    (ICP-MS) and sector field ICP-MS (SF-ICP-MS) were the two most commonly used instrumental
    techniques. Results of all participating NMIs/DIs were evaluated against the supplementary
    comparison reference value (SCRV). The SCRV and associated uncertainty were determined
    from results of NMIs/DIs that participated in the supplementary comparison using
    methods with demonstrated metrological traceability. For cadmium, mercury and
    lead, the median was used as estimator of the SCRVs. For arsenic, the arithmetic
    mean was used as estimator of the SCRV. The SCRVs (± expanded uncertainty) for
    arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead (in mg/kg) were 4.188 (± 0.237), 2.0670 (±
    0.0171), 2.732 (± 0.147) and 10.406 (± 0.080), respectively. The degree of equivalence
    and its associated uncertainty were calculated for each submitted result. Most
    participating institutes were able to demonstrate their capabilities in the determination
    of elements in lipstick material.</p><p>Participating NMIs/DIs that have successfully
    participated in APMP.QM-S17 have demonstrated measurement capabilities in determining
    mass fraction of transition elements and metalloids/semi-metals, in mass fraction
    range from 0.1 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg in cosmetic matrices with high organic contents,
    such as lipstick.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.

    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
