    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is produced mainly by the metabolic activities of oceanic phytoplankton and the most abundant natural sulfur compound in the atmosphere. DMS plays an important role for climate change since it is oxidized and forms sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, affecting the Earth's radiation budget directly and indirectly. DMS is designated as one of the target reactive gases and monitored in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) programme. It is important to accurately monitor its global background levels with SI traceability for better understanding of the role of DMS in climate change. This comparison is organized by Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). Gas mixtures gravimetrically prepared by KRISS are used for demonstrating measurement equivalence at the highest metrological level. This comparison (Track C) is designed to underpin participants' measurement capabilities of trace level DMS in nitrogen at the nominal amount fraction of 5 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
