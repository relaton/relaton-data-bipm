abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is produced mainly by the metabolic
    activities of oceanic phytoplankton and the most abundant natural sulfur compound
    in the atmosphere. DMS plays an important role for climate change since it is
    oxidized and forms sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, affecting the Earth's radiation
    budget directly and indirectly. DMS is designated as one of the target reactive
    gases and monitored in the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmospheric
    Watch (GAW) programme. It is important to accurately monitor its global background
    levels with SI traceability for better understanding of the role of DMS in climate
    change. This comparison is organized by Korea Research Institute of Standards
    and Science (KRISS). Gas mixtures gravimetrically prepared by KRISS are used for
    demonstrating measurement equivalence at the highest metrological level. This
    comparison (Track C) is designed to underpin participants' measurement capabilities
    of trace level DMS in nitrogen at the nominal amount fraction of 5 nmol mol<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p>To

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
