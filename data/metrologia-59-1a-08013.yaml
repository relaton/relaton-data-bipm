abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Under the auspices of the Protein Analysis Working Group (PAWG)
    of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a key comparison,
    CCQM-K115.2018, was coordinated by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures
    (BIPM), the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) of Singapore and the Chinese National
    Institute of Metrology (NIM). Ten Metrology Institutes or Designated Institutes
    and the BIPM participated. Participants were required to assign the mass fraction
    of the hexapeptide of HbA0 (VE) present as the main component in the comparison
    sample for CCQM-K115.2018. The comparison samples were prepared by HSA/BIPM from
    synthetic VE purchased from a commercial supplier and used as provided without
    further treatment or purification.</p><p>VE was selected to be representative
    of the performance of a laboratory's measurement capability for the purity assignment
    of chemically synthesized peptides of known sequence, without cross-links, up
    to 5 kDa and without modification. It was anticipated to provide an analytical
    measurement challenge representative for the value-assignment of compounds of
    broadly similar structural characteristics.</p><p>The majority of participants
    used amino acid analysis (PICAA) with a correction for structurally-related peptide
    impurities approach as the amount of material that had been provided to each participant
    (25 mg) was insufficient to perform a full mass balance based characterization
    of the material by a participating laboratory. The coordinators, the BIPM, the
    HSA and the NIM, were the laboratories to use the mass balance approach as they
    had more material available.</p><p>It was decided to propose KCRVs for both the
    VE mass fraction and the mass fraction of the peptide related impurities as indispensable
    contributor regardless of the use of PICAA, mass balance or any other approach
    to determine the VE purity. This allowed participants to demonstrate the efficacy
    of their implementation of the approaches used to determine the VE mass fraction.
    In particular, it allowed participants to demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation
    of peptide related impurity identification and quantification.</p><p>More detailed
    studies on the identification/quantification of peptide related impurities revealed
    that the integrity of the impurity profile of the related peptide impurities obtained
    by the participant is crucial for the impact on accuracy of the VE mass fraction
    assignment.</p><p>The assessment of the mass fraction of peptide impurities is
    based on the assumption that only the most consistent set of results is taken
    for the calculation of the KCRV<sub>PepImp</sub>. The sum of the combined cis/trans
    VE depsipeptide impurities (only identified/quantified by NRC and confirmed by
    BIPM and HSA) and mass fractions of peptide related impurities that have been
    identified by at least two participants have been used to establish the KCRV<sub>PepImp</sub>.
    The KCRV<sub>PepImp</sub> of 53.0 mg/g is associated with a corresponding expanded
    uncertainty of 17.3 mg/g (k = 2) providing a more realistic basis of evaluation
    for the capabilities of the participants to identify/quantify peptide related
    impurities. Inspection of the degree of equivalence plots for the mass fraction
    of peptide impurities and additional information obtained from the peptide related
    impurity profile indicates that in all cases the major related peptide impurity,
    VE depsipeptide, has not been identified. The VE depsipeptide impurity was initially
    and uniquely identified and quantified by the NRC by the use of<sup>1</sup>H-NMR.
    The related peptide impurity mass fraction results of only four participants (NRC,
    LGC, LNE and HSA) are in agreement with the KCRV<sub>PepImp</sub>. The NRC has
    identified and quantified the VE depsipeptide whereas the LGC, LNE and HSA have
    not identified the VE depsipeptide but accounted for that contribution.</p><p>The
    approach selected to obtain a KCRV<sub>VE</sub> for the mass fraction of VE is
    based on a mass balance calculation that takes into account the most consistent
    set of results for the peptide related impurities KCRV<sub>PepImp</sub>, TFA mass
    fraction and the water mass fraction. The KCRV<sub>VE</sub> for CCQM-K115.2018
    is 613 mg/g with a corresponding expanded uncertainty of the KCRV<sub>VE</sub>
    of 20 mg/g (k = 2).</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
