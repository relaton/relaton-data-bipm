abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Under the auspices of the Protein Analysis Working Group (PAWG)
    of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) a pilot study, CCQM-P55.2.2018,
    was coordinated by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), the Health
    Sciences Authority (HSA) of Singapore and the Chinese National Institute of Metrology
    (NIM). Three Metrology Institutes or Designated Institutes and the BIPM participated.
    Participants were required to assign the mass fraction of hexapeptide of HbA0
    (VE) present as the main component in the comparison sample for CCQM-P55.2.2018.
    The comparison samples were prepared by HSA/BIPM from synthetic VE purchased from
    a commercial supplier and used as provided without further treatment or purification.</p><p>VE
    was selected to be representative of the performance of a laboratory's measurement
    capability for the purity assignment of chemically synthesized peptides of known
    sequence, without cross-links, up to 5 kDa and without modification. It was anticipated
    to provide an analytical measurement challenge representative for the value-assignment
    of compounds of broadly similar structural characteristics.</p><p>The majority
    of participants used amino acid analysis (PICAA) or quantitative nuclear magnetic
    resonance (PICqNMR) spectroscopy with a correction for structurally related peptide
    impurities. It was decided to assign reference values (RVs) based on the KCRVs
    of CCQM-K115.2018 for both the VE mass fraction and the mass fraction of the peptide-related
    impurities as indispensable contributor regardless of the use of PICAA, mass balance
    or any other approach to determine the VE purity. This allowed participants to
    demonstrate the efficacy of their implementation of the approaches used to determine
    the VE mass fraction. In particular, it allows participants to demonstrate the
    efficacy of their implementation of peptide-related impurity identification and
    quantification.</p><p>More detailed studies on the identification/quantification
    of peptide related impurities revealed that the integrity of the impurity profile
    of the related peptide impurities obtained by the participant is crucial for the
    impact on accuracy of the VE mass fraction assignment.</p><p>The assessment of
    the mass fraction of peptide impurities is based on the assumption that only the
    most consistent set of results is taken for the calculation of the RV<sub>PepImp</sub>.
    The sum of the combined cis/trans VE depsipeptide impurities (only identified/quantified
    by NRC and confirmed by BIPM and HSA) and mass fractions of peptide-related impurities
    that have been identified by at least two participants have been used to establish
    the RV<sub>PepImp</sub>. The RV<sub>PepImp</sub> of 53.0 mg/g is associated with
    a corresponding expanded uncertainty of 17.3 mg/g (k = 2) providing a more realistic
    basis of evaluation for the capabilities of the participants to identify/quantify
    peptide related impurities. Inspection of the degree of equivalence plots for
    the mass fraction of peptide impurities and additional information obtained from
    the peptide-related impurity profile indicates that in all cases the major related
    peptide impurity, VE depsipeptide, has not been identified. The VE depsipeptide
    impurity was initially and uniquely identified and quantified by the NRC by the
    use of<sup>1</sup>H-NMR in the parallel CCQM-K115.2018. The related peptide impurity
    mass fraction results of only four participants (NRC, LGC, LNE and HSA) are in
    agreement with the RV<sub>PepImp</sub>. The NRC has identified and quantified
    the VE depsipeptide whereas the LGC, LNE and HSA have not identified the VE depsipeptide
    but accounted for that contribution.</p><p>The approach selected to obtain a RV<sub>VE</sub>
    for the mass fraction of VE is based on a mass balance calculation that takes
    into account the most consistent set of results for the peptide-related impurities
    RV<sub>PepImp</sub>, TFA mass fraction and the water mass fraction. The RV<sub>VE</sub>
    based on CCQM-K115.2018 is 613 mg/g with a corresponding expanded uncertainty
    of the RV<sub>VE</sub> of 20 mg/g (k = 2). Inspection of the degree of equivalence
    plots for the mass fraction of VE shows that all results obtained by PICAA agree
    with the RV<sub>VE</sub> while the result obtained by the BIPM with PICqNMR disagrees
    with the RV<sub>VE</sub>.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on

    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
