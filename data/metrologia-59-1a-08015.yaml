abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The accurate quantification of ethanol in water is essential
    for forensic applications such as blood and breath alcohol testing and for commercial
    applications such as the assessment of alcoholic beverages.</p><p>The intercomparison
    EURAMET.QM-S14 is part of a capacity building project named ALCOREF "Certified
    forensic alcohol reference materials" [1] that is running within the European
    Metrology Programme for Innovation and Research (EMPIR) [2]. The intercomparison
    should allow project partners and other interested National Metrology Institutes
    (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) to benchmark their analytical methods for
    the quantification of ethanol in water. The study plan was agreed by the European
    Association of National Metrology Institutes (EURAMET) Subcommittee Bio- and Organic
    Analysis (SCBOA) and the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif
    pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) in February and April 2019, respectively. The
    intercomparison was coordinated by BAM. Two concentration levels relevant for
    the calibration and verification of evidential breath alcohol analysers were distributed
    to study participants. Fifteen institutes from 15 countries registered for the
    intercomparison and returned results. Participants mostly applied gas chromatography
    with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) or mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), one participant
    used titrimetry and one participant employed a test bench for breath analyser
    calibration ("bubble train"). Participants did either in-house purity assessment
    of their commercial ethanol calibrants by Karl-Fischer titration, chromatographic
    methods, quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (qNMR) and/or density
    measurements; or they used ethanol/water Certified Reference Materials (CRMs)
    from NMIs/DIs for calibration.</p><p>CCQM OAWG agreed to use a consensus value
    from participants' results that utilizes the reported uncertainties as Key Comparison
    Reference Value (KCRV). The Gaussian Random effects model with Hierarchical Bayesian
    solution (HB-REM) is a reasonable approach in this case. The KCRVs and Degrees
    of Equivalence (DoEs) were calculated with the NIST consensus builder version
    1.2 Hierarchical Bayes procedure [3].</p><p>Successful participation in the interlaboratory
    comparison has demonstrated the capabilities in determining the mass fraction
    of ethanol in aqueous matrices in the range 0.1 mg/g to 8 mg/g. Fourteen out of
    15 participants have successfully quantified both samples, one participant successfully
    quantified only the lower-level (0.6 mg/g) sample.</p><p>To reach the main text

    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
