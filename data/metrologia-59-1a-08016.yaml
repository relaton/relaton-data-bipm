abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM-K156 comparison was coordinated by TUBITAK UME on
    behalf of the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif
    pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) for National Measurement Institutes (NMIs)
    and Designated Institutes (DIs) which provide measurement services in organic
    analysis under the 'Comité International des Poids et Mesures' Mutual Recognition
    Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p><p>Perfluoro alkyl substances (PFAS) such as PFOS and
    PFOA have been used in numerous industrial applications and products. Because
    of their high stability and resistance to biodegradation, atmospheric photooxidation,
    direct photolysis and hydrolysis, they are extremely persistent in the environment.
    The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive lists PFOS as a priority hazardous
    substance that poses a significant risk to the aquatic environment. The use of
    PFOS-containing Aqueous Film-Forming Foams (AFFFs) has been banned since June
    2011 in the EU. As relatively water-soluble, effectively non-degradable compounds,
    PFOS and PFOA migrate to ground water. They are not removed in the conventional
    drinking water treatment, and therefore cause health risks in polluted areas.
    The EU Drinking Water Directive and the European Commission has proposed a limit
    value of 100 ng/L for the sum of 20 PFAS, including PFOS and PFOA.</p><p>This
    study provides the means for assessing measurement capabilities for determination
    of high polarity measurands in a procedure that requires extraction, clean-up,
    analytical separation and detection. Successful participation in CCQM-K156 demonstrates
    measurement capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with
    a molecular mass of 200 g/mol to 700 g/mol, having high polarity pKow &gt; -2,
    in a mass fraction range from 0.5 ng/kg to 500 ng/kg in aqueous media.</p><p>Nine
    NMIs and DIs participated in the CCQM-K156 key comparison. Seven institutes reported
    their results. SPE was applied in the sample pre-treatment and LC-MS was applied
    for detection. All participating laboratories applied isotope dilution mass spectrometry
    (IDMS) techniques for quantification. Participants established the metrological
    traceability of their results using certified reference materials (CRMs) from
    NMIs with stated traceability; where commercially available high purity materials
    were used the purity was determined in-house. The CCQM-K156 results for L-PFOA
    and L-PFOS range from 2.75 ng/kg to 5.50 ng/kg with a % RSD of 19.5 % for L-PFOA
    and from 2.04 ng/kg to 4.45 ng/kg with a % RSD of 21.3 % for L-PFOS. The KCRV
    was assigned using a Hierarchical Bayesian Random Effects Model (HB REM) estimator
    from the values reported by six of the participants. One participant result of
    L-PFOS and one result of L-PFOA were excluded from the KCRV for technical reasons.
    The KCRV was 4.9 ng/kg ± 0.4 ng/kg for L-PFOA and 3.8 ng/kg ± 0.4 ng/kg for L-PFOS.
    The six institutes that were included in the assignment of consensus KCRV all
    agreed within their standard uncertainties.</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
