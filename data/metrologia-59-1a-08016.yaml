    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The CCQM-K156 comparison was coordinated by TUBITAK UME on behalf of the Organic Analysis Working Group (OAWG) of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM) for National Measurement Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes (DIs) which provide measurement services in organic analysis under the 'Comité International des Poids et Mesures' Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
    <p>Perfluoro alkyl substances (PFAS) such as PFOS and PFOA have been used in numerous industrial applications and products. Because of their high stability and resistance to biodegradation, atmospheric photooxidation, direct photolysis and hydrolysis, they are extremely persistent in the environment. The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive lists PFOS as a priority hazardous substance that poses a significant risk to the aquatic environment. The use of PFOS-containing Aqueous Film-Forming Foams (AFFFs) has been banned since June 2011 in the EU. As relatively water-soluble, effectively non-degradable compounds, PFOS and PFOA migrate to ground water. They are not removed in the conventional drinking water treatment, and therefore cause health risks in polluted areas. The EU Drinking Water Directive and the European Commission has proposed a limit value of 100 ng/L for the sum of 20 PFAS, including PFOS and PFOA.</p>
    <p>This study provides the means for assessing measurement capabilities for determination of high polarity measurands in a procedure that requires extraction, clean-up, analytical separation and detection. Successful participation in CCQM-K156 demonstrates measurement capabilities in determining mass fraction of organic compounds, with a molecular mass of 200 g/mol to 700 g/mol, having high polarity pKow &gt; -2, in a mass fraction range from 0.5 ng/kg to 500 ng/kg in aqueous media.</p>
    <p>Nine NMIs and DIs participated in the CCQM-K156 key comparison. Seven institutes reported their results. SPE was applied in the sample pre-treatment and LC-MS was applied for detection. All participating laboratories applied isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) techniques for quantification. Participants established the metrological traceability of their results using certified reference materials (CRMs) from NMIs with stated traceability; where commercially available high purity materials were used the purity was determined in-house. The CCQM-K156 results for L-PFOA and L-PFOS range from 2.75 ng/kg to 5.50 ng/kg with a % RSD of 19.5 % for L-PFOA and from 2.04 ng/kg to 4.45 ng/kg with a % RSD of 21.3 % for L-PFOS. The KCRV was assigned using a Hierarchical Bayesian Random Effects Model (HB REM) estimator from the values reported by six of the participants. One participant result of L-PFOS and one result of L-PFOA were excluded from the KCRV for technical reasons. The KCRV was 4.9 ng/kg ± 0.4 ng/kg for L-PFOA and 3.8 ng/kg ± 0.4 ng/kg for L-PFOS. The six institutes that were included in the assignment of consensus KCRV all agreed within their standard uncertainties.</p>
