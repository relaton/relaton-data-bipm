    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>CCQM-K118 was an international key comparison on natural gas composition with two types of gases, i.e., a low calorific hydrogen-enriched natural gas and a high calorific LNG type of gas. There were 14 participating laboratories. The traveling standards (i.e., 14 mixtures each) were obtained from an external source and checked for homogeneity and stability before and after the participants' measurements at the two coordinating laboratories. The data evaluation was performed using a consensus value and a laboratory effect model. The results of the participants were benchmarked against a key comparison reference value computed from the largest consistent subset (LCS) of the submitted results, adjusted for the differences between the travelling standards. For the first time in a key comparison in gas analysis, the model included a term to account for excess variability in the LCS. Most of the participants reported one or a few (slightly) discrepant results. Partly this is due to the heterogeneity and heteroscedasticity of the datasets. In all, the results in this key comparison demonstrate the good comparability of the national measurement standards for natural gas composition maintained by the participating NMIs.</p>
