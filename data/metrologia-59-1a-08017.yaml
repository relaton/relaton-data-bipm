abstract:
- content: Main text<p>CCQM-K118 was an international key comparison on natural gas
    composition with two types of gases, i.e., a low calorific hydrogen-enriched natural
    gas and a high calorific LNG type of gas. There were 14 participating laboratories.
    The traveling standards (i.e., 14 mixtures each) were obtained from an external
    source and checked for homogeneity and stability before and after the participants'
    measurements at the two coordinating laboratories. The data evaluation was performed
    using a consensus value and a laboratory effect model. The results of the participants
    were benchmarked against a key comparison reference value computed from the largest
    consistent subset (LCS) of the submitted results, adjusted for the differences
    between the travelling standards. For the first time in a key comparison in gas
    analysis, the model included a term to account for excess variability in the LCS.
    Most of the participants reported one or a few (slightly) discrepant results.
    Partly this is due to the heterogeneity and heteroscedasticity of the datasets.
    In all, the results in this key comparison demonstrate the good comparability
    of the national measurement standards for natural gas composition maintained by
    the participating NMIs.</p><p>Main text. To reach the main text of this paper,
