    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The Supplementary comparison EURAMET.AUV.V-S1 has been carried out within the framework of the CIPM MRA. The specific task of this comparison is the measurement of the magnitude and phase of the sensitivity of single-ended accelerometers in the medium frequency domain (10 to 10 000 Hz). The sensitivity is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the output of the accelerometer to the amplitude of the acceleration at its reference surface with secondary means in accordance with ISO 16063-21 "Methods for the calibration of vibration and shock transducers - Part 21: Vibration calibration by comparison to a reference transducer". The participating NMIs are BEV (Austria), BIM (Bulgaria), CMI (Czech Republic), IPQ (Portugal), KEBS (Kenya), METAS (Switzerland) and MIKES (Finland). BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory of the comparison. The measurements took place between October 2019 and February 2021. Three single-ended accelerometers were circulated. The final report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of equivalence degrees.</p>
