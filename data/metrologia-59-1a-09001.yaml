abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The Supplementary comparison EURAMET.AUV.V-S1 has been carried
    out within the framework of the CIPM MRA. The specific task of this comparison
    is the measurement of the magnitude and phase of the sensitivity of single-ended
    accelerometers in the medium frequency domain (10 to 10 000 Hz). The sensitivity
    is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the output of the accelerometer
    to the amplitude of the acceleration at its reference surface with secondary means
    in accordance with ISO 16063-21 "Methods for the calibration of vibration and
    shock transducers - Part 21: Vibration calibration by comparison to a reference
    transducer". The participating NMIs are BEV (Austria), BIM (Bulgaria), CMI (Czech
    Republic), IPQ (Portugal), KEBS (Kenya), METAS (Switzerland) and MIKES (Finland).
    BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory of the comparison. The measurements took
    place between October 2019 and February 2021. Three single-ended accelerometers
    were circulated. The final report includes the measurement results from the participants,
    information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation
    of equivalence degrees.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
