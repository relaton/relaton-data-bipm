abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The supplementary comparison EURAMET.AUV.V-S2 has been carried
    out within the framework of the CIPM MRA. The specific task of this comparison
    is the measurement of the magnitude and phase of the sensitivity of single-ended
    accelerometers in the medium frequency domain (10 Hz to 10000 Hz). The sensitivity
    is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the output of the accelerometer
    to the amplitude of the acceleration at its reference surface with secondary means
    in accordance with ISO 16063-21 "Methods for the calibration of vibration and
    shock transducers - Part 21: Vibration calibration by comparison to a reference
    transducer". The participating NMIs are BEV (Austria), and METAS (Switzerland).
    BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory of this bilateral comparison. The measurements
    took place between November 2021 and January 2022. A single-ended accelerometer
    was circulated. This report includes the measurement results, information about
    calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of equivalence
    degrees.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note

    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the
    CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
