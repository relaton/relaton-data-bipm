    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The supplementary comparison EURAMET.AUV.V-S2 has been carried out within the framework of the CIPM MRA. The specific task of this comparison is the measurement of the magnitude and phase of the sensitivity of single-ended accelerometers in the medium frequency domain (10 Hz to 10000 Hz). The sensitivity is calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the output of the accelerometer to the amplitude of the acceleration at its reference surface with secondary means in accordance with ISO 16063-21 "Methods for the calibration of vibration and shock transducers - Part 21: Vibration calibration by comparison to a reference transducer". The participating NMIs are BEV (Austria), and METAS (Switzerland). BEV (Austria) was the pilot laboratory of this bilateral comparison. The measurements took place between November 2021 and January 2022. A single-ended accelerometer was circulated. This report includes the measurement results, information about calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignation of equivalence degrees.</p>
