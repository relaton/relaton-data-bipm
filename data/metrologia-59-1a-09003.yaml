    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report is the final report for key comparison CCAUV.W-K2. This key comparison covers primary free-field standards for sound in water at frequencies between 250 Hz and 500 kHz. This project is one of the key comparisons organised under the auspices of the Consultative Committee on Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the CIPM.</p>
    <p>This report has the status of a Final Report and has been submitted to the Key Comparison Database (KCDB). In the report, the results of participants are presented with the Key Comparison Reference Values and Degrees of Equivalence. The results are calculated according to the procedures agreed after consideration of the Draft A1 and A2 reports, and the Draft B report has been approved by the CCAUV. All participants have had the opportunity to give final agreement on the contents and amendments have been made to account for their comments.</p>
    <p>In many respects, the comparison has been a success with good agreement achieved over an extended lower frequency range compared to the previous CCAUV.W-K1 comparison, the lower frequency limit for CCAUV.W-K2 being extended down by two octaves to 250 Hz. The generally more difficult frequency range from 100 kHz to 500 kHz has also shown very good agreement between the participants. However, in the range 60 kHz to 100 kHz the agreement was not as good, with three participants exhibiting some discrepant results.</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
