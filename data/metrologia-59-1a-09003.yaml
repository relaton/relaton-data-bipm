abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report is the final report for key comparison CCAUV.W-K2.
    This key comparison covers primary free-field standards for sound in water at
    frequencies between 250 Hz and 500 kHz. This project is one of the key comparisons
    organised under the auspices of the Consultative Committee on Acoustics, Ultrasound
    and Vibration (CCAUV) of the CIPM.</p><p>This report has the status of a Final
    Report and has been submitted to the Key Comparison Database (KCDB). In the report,
    the results of participants are presented with the Key Comparison Reference Values
    and Degrees of Equivalence. The results are calculated according to the procedures
    agreed after consideration of the Draft A1 and A2 reports, and the Draft B report
    has been approved by the CCAUV. All participants have had the opportunity to give
    final agreement on the contents and amendments have been made to account for their
    comments.</p><p>In many respects, the comparison has been a success with good
    agreement achieved over an extended lower frequency range compared to the previous
    CCAUV.W-K1 comparison, the lower frequency limit for CCAUV.W-K2 being extended
    down by two octaves to 250 Hz. The generally more difficult frequency range from
    100 kHz to 500 kHz has also shown very good agreement between the participants.
    However, in the range 60 kHz to 100 kHz the agreement was not as good, with three
    participants exhibiting some discrepant results.</p><p>To reach the main text
    of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
