abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The magnet system is an essential component of the Kibble balance,
    a device that is used to realize the unit of mass. It is the source of the magnetic
    flux, and its importance is captured in the geometric factor Bl. Ironically, the
    Bl factor cancels out and does not appear in the final Kibble equation. Nevertheless,
    care must be taken to design and build the magnet system because the cancellation
    is perfect only if the Bl is the same in both modes: the weighing and velocity
    mode. This review provides the knowledge necessary to build a magnetic circuit
    for the Kibble balance. In addition, this article discusses the design considerations,
    parameter optimizations, practical adjustments to the finished product, and an
    assessment of systematic uncertainties associated with the magnet system.</p>'
