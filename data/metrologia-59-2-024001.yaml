abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Spectral irradiance scale in the wavelength range from 250 nm
    to 2500 nm was realized at National Institute of Metrology on the basis of a large
    area tungsten carbide–carbon (WC–C) high temperature fixed point blackbody, which
    is composed of a 14 mm diameter WC–C fixed point cell and a variable temperature
    blackbody BB3500MP as a furnace. A series of 1000 W FEL tungsten halogen lamps
    were used as transfer standards. The new spectral irradiance scale was compared
    with the scale based on a variable-temperature blackbody BB3500M, and the divergence
    between these two methods varied from −0.66% to 0.79% from 280 nm to 2100 nm.
    The measurement uncertainty of spectral irradiance scale based on fixed-point
    blackbody was analyzed, and the expanded uncertainty was estimated as 3.9% at
    250 nm, 1.4% at 280 nm, 0.43% at 400 nm, 0.27% at 800 nm, 0.25% at 1000 nm, 0.62%
    at 1500 nm, 0.76% at 2000 nm, and 2.4% at 2500 nm respectively. In the range from
    300 nm to 1000 nm the fixed-point scale was improved obviously: the uncertainty
    decreased by more than 25% compared to the uncertainty based on the variable temperature
    blackbody. Below 300 nm, the uncertainty became higher because the signal to noise
    ratio was poor. Above 1100 nm, the contribution of temperature measurement to
    the uncertainty of spectral irradiance decreases, therefore the uncertainties
    of two methods are almost at the same level. The fixed-point blackbody was also
    used to realize the correlated colour temperature and distribution temperature
    of a tungsten filament lamp, the deviation from the variable temperature blackbody
    method was −0.5 K and −2.9 K, respectively.</p>'
