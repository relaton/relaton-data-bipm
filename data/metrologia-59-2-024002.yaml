abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Autocollimators are versatile devices for angle metrology used
    in a wide range of applications in engineering and manufacturing. A modern electronic
    autocollimator generally features two measuring axes and can thus fully determine
    the surface normal of an optical surface relative to it in space. Until recently,
    however, the calibration capabilities of the National Metrology Institutes were
    limited to plane angles. Although it was possible to calibrate both measuring
    axes independently of each other, it was not feasible to determine their crosstalk
    if angular deflections were present in both axes simultaneously. To expand autocollimator
    calibrations from plane angles to spatial angles, PTB and VTT MIKES have created
    dedicated calibration devices which are based on different measurement principles
    and accomplish the task of metrological traceability in different ways. Comparing
    calibrations of a transfer standard makes it possible to detect systematic measurement
    errors of the two devices and to evaluate the validity of their uncertainty budgets.
    The uncertainty levels of the devices are comparable to each other, with an expanded
    uncertainty U = 0.014 arcsecond (95.5% coverage probability) over a measuring
    range of ±1000 arcsecond in the case of PTB and U = 0.015 arcsecond over a range
    of ±500 arcsecond and U = 0.020 arcsecond over ±1000 arcsecond in the case of
    VTT MIKES. Over a range of ±1000 arcsecond with regards to both measuring axis
    of an Elcomat 3000 autocollimator as a transfer standard, no statistically significant
    differences between the calibrations were detected. The results thus confirm the
    calibration capabilities of PTB and VTT MIKES as stated in the calibration and
    measuring capability database of Bureau International des Poids et Mesures.</p>
