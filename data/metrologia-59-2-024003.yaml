abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The realisation of the metre definition is still today mostly
    performed using iodine frequency-stabilized HeNe lasers. Unfortunately, they deliver
    little optical power. Instead of migrating to other expensive laser technologies,
    the use of an injection locked semiconductor laser is proposed in order to boost
    the optical output of the legacy HeNe laser primary reference. The characterisation
    of the system and its validation through a comparison measurement is reported
    whereby no impact on the frequency and the stability of the HeNe reference laser
    could be observed.</p>
