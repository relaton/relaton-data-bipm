abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Spectral interferometry is becoming a popular method of performing
    dimensional measurements, e.g. of surfaces, but such devices require pre-calibration
    of their spectrometers to achieve traceability. The use of a spectral lamp and
    imaging spectrometer to perform inherently traceable distance measurements using
    spectral interferometry, without the need for external calibration, is proposed
    and its experimental feasibility demonstrated. Initial experiments show measurements
    over a working range of 200 µm. The estimated standard uncertainty of the distance
    measurements is 0.6 nm, corresponding to an expanded uncertainty of 1.2 nm at
    k = 2.</p>
