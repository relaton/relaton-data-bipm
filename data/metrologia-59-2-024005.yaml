abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) has developed
    a highly accurate two-point diameter measurement method of a sphere using a micro-coordinate
    measuring machine (µ-CMM) with a low-force two-dimensional touch probe. The measured
    sphere is used as a reference to calibrate the probe of other µ-CMM in industry.
    Our strategy for measuring sphere’s diameter is that the probe radius of NMIJ’s
    µ-CMM is calibrated using a reference gauge block, and the NMIJ’s µ-CMM using
    the calibrated probe measures the mean two-point diameter of a sphere. To achieve
    the highly accurate calibration of the reference gauge block, we have adopted
    a double-sided interferometer (DSI) and an atomic force microscopy (AFM). The
    DSI measures the length of gauge block without wringing. The phase correction
    value of the gauge block is evaluated by measuring the surface roughness using
    the AFM. Using the DSI and AFM, the mechanical length of reference gauge block
    was obtained with the expanded uncertainty of 13 nm (k = 2). Then, the probe radius
    of NMIJ’s µ-CMM was also calibrated using the reference gauge block calibrated
    by the DSI and the AFM. The µ-CMM’s probe radius was obtained with the expanded
    uncertainty of 10 nm (k = 2). Finally, the µ-CMM measured the mean two-point diameter
    of a sphere with the expanded uncertainty 21 nm (k = 2) was demonstrated.</p>
