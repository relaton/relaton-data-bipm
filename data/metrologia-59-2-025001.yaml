abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Improvements in a lamp-monochromator-based facility at the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Visible near-infrared Spectral
    Comparator Facility (VisSCF) which is used to calibrate optical detectors for
    spectral radiant power responsivity from 300 nm to 1100 nm, are described. These
    changes include extending the VisSCF operational range down to 300 nm from 350 nm,
    thereby fully covering the ultraviolet-A (UVA) spectral region and partially covering
    the UVB range. These improvements have lowered the magnitudes of most of the components
    in the uncertainty budget and have led to combined 0.005% transfer (k = 1) uncertainties
    in the spectral power responsivity calibrations over most of the spectral range.
    Redevelopment of the uncertainty budget results in total expanded uncertainties
    of spectral responsivities of less than 0.1% (k = 2) over the spectral range from
    380 nm to 980 nm, with the greatest uncertainty term coming from the calibrations
    of the transfer standards.</p>
