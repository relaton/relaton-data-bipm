abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Goniometric measurements are essential for the determination
    of many optical quantities, and quantifying the effects of errors in the rotation
    axes on these quantities is a complex task. In this paper, we show how a measurement
    model for a four-axis goniometric system can be developed to allow the effects
    of alignment and rotation errors to be included in the uncertainty of the measurement.
    We use three different computational methods to propagate the uncertainties due
    to several error sources through the model to the rotation angles and then to
    the measurement of bidirectional reflectance and integrated diffuse reflectance,
    a task that would otherwise be intractable. While all three methods give the same
    result, the GTC Python package is the simplest and intrinsically provides a full
    uncertainty budget, including all correlations between measurement parameters.
    We then demonstrate how the development of a measurement model and the use of
    GTC has improved our understanding of the system. As a consequence, taking advantage
    of negative correlations between measurements in different geometries allows us
    to minimise the total uncertainty in integrated diffuse reflectance, lowering
    the standard uncertainty from 0.0029 to 0.0015.</p>
