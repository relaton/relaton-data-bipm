    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The realization of the low light level illuminance scale of the National Institute of Metrology (NIM, China) is presented. Two methods were used to achieve the photometric scale covering (1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>–2 × 10<sup>0</sup>) lx, the first method based on the luminance adjustable two-stage integrating sphere source was used to realize the illuminance scale down to 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> lx, while the other method based on a twin-source superposition linearity measurement facility was applied to extend the scale from 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> lx to 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> lx. The expanded relative uncertainty of the (1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>–2 × 10<sup>0</sup>) lx illuminance scale was evaluated to be from 1.0 % to 0.8 % varying with range (coverage factor <italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2). As part of our research work, a photon counting type photometer was developed and calibrated in the (2 × 10<sup>−10</sup>–1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) lx range using this low light level illuminance scale with expanded relative uncertainty 13 % to 1.4 % (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2). This low light level photometric scale can meet the calibration requirement of high sensitivity photometers such as the micro-lux photometers and photon counting type photometers.</p>
