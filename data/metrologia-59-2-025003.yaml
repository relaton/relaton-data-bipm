abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The realization of the low light level illuminance scale of
    the National Institute of Metrology (NIM, China) is presented. Two methods were
    used to achieve the photometric scale covering (1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>–2 × 10<sup>0</sup>)
    lx, the first method based on the luminance adjustable two-stage integrating sphere
    source was used to realize the illuminance scale down to 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> lx,
    while the other method based on a twin-source superposition linearity measurement
    facility was applied to extend the scale from 1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> lx to 1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>
    lx. The expanded relative uncertainty of the (1 × 10<sup>−10</sup>–2 × 10<sup>0</sup>)
    lx illuminance scale was evaluated to be from 1.0 % to 0.8 % varying with range
    (coverage factor k = 2). As part of our research work, a photon counting type
    photometer was developed and calibrated in the (2 × 10<sup>−10</sup>–1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>)
    lx range using this low light level illuminance scale with expanded relative uncertainty
    13 % to 1.4 % (k = 2). This low light level photometric scale can meet the calibration
    requirement of high sensitivity photometers such as the micro-lux photometers
    and photon counting type photometers.</p>
