abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper describes a detailed derivation of the uncertainty
    budget for measurements of the absolute spectral radiance factor with PTB’s gonioreflectometers.
    The measurement uncertainty is determined according to the ‘Guide to the expression
    of uncertainty in measurement’ provided by the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures. To give an insight, the uncertainty analysis is applied to measurements
    of three ceramic samples. The influence of different systematic and statistical
    sources of uncertainty and their contributions are discussed in detail. For wavelengths
    larger than 450 nm the total measurement uncertainty is dominated by systematic
    contributions. Towards UVA the major contribution is caused by statistical effects,
    which are mainly due to the decreasing power of the radiation source used. We
    present an approach capable to reduce this contribution for the VIS/UVA-transition
    spectral range by means of a specially designed LED-based sphere radiation source.</p>
