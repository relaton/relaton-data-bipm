abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>To realize the kilogram with high accuracy using the x-ray crystal
    density method, mass deficit correction to account for the number of vacancy defects
    in silicon-28 crystals is necessary. In this paper, we present the results of
    electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy experiments performed on a
    silicon-28 crystal. The crystal was cut from near the radial center of the Si28–23Pr11
    crystal boule where a relatively high vacancy defect concentration was expected
    within the boule, which was grown by the floating zone method. We obtained both
    the in-phase and out-of-phase EPR spectra, which focused on the fast- and slow-spin
    relaxation centers, respectively. Based on EPR measurements both in the dark and
    under illumination, the concentrations of phosphorus impurities with unpaired
    electrons were found to be between 1.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> and 3.4
    × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. In contrast, EPR-active vacancy defects in
    the silicon-28 crystal were not detected at the detection sensitivity of the present
    measurements (around 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>), although at the Si/SiO<sub>2</sub>
    interface, dangling-bond defects (P<sub>b0</sub> centers) were detected with an
    areal density between 0.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> and 1.7 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>.
    The experimental detection of a larger amount of phosphorus donors under illumination
    indicates the presence of compensation centers (electronic levels acting as acceptors)
    with a concentration of at most 1.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. We determined
    that such a concentration is mainly compensated by the boron acceptors, and that
    there is little contribution of electrically active vacancy defects, 0.0(6) ×
    10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. This value is much smaller than the previously
    reported concentrations of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> to 4 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>
    for vacancy defects determined by positron annihilation spectroscopy.</p>
