    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>To realize the kilogram with high accuracy using the x-ray crystal density method, mass deficit correction to account for the number of vacancy defects in silicon-28 crystals is necessary. In this paper, we present the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy experiments performed on a silicon-28 crystal. The crystal was cut from near the radial center of the Si28–23Pr11 crystal boule where a relatively high vacancy defect concentration was expected within the boule, which was grown by the floating zone method. We obtained both the in-phase and out-of-phase EPR spectra, which focused on the fast- and slow-spin relaxation centers, respectively. Based on EPR measurements both in the dark and under illumination, the concentrations of phosphorus impurities with unpaired electrons were found to be between 1.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> and 3.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. In contrast, EPR-active vacancy defects in the silicon-28 crystal were not detected at the detection sensitivity of the present measurements (around 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>), although at the Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> interface, dangling-bond defects (<italic toggle="yes">P</italic>
                   <sub>b0</sub> centers) were detected with an areal density between 0.4 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> and 1.7 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>. The experimental detection of a larger amount of phosphorus donors under illumination indicates the presence of compensation centers (electronic levels acting as acceptors) with a concentration of at most 1.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. We determined that such a concentration is mainly compensated by the boron acceptors, and that there is little contribution of electrically active vacancy defects, 0.0(6) × 10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. This value is much smaller than the previously reported concentrations of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> to 4 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> for vacancy defects determined by positron annihilation spectroscopy.</p>
