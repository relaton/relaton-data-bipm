abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Present article describes a 3D gonioreflectometer developed
    at Aalto University for the measurement of spectral bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (sBRDF) of horizontally aligned samples, needed to study
    sBRDF of sand from satellite calibration test sites. The new set-up incorporates
    three motorized arms that allow to measure in- and out-of-plane sBRDF. Illumination
    of the sample is provided by a supercontinuum laser coupled with laser line tunable
    filters and detection is performed with two types of photodiodes (Si and InGaAs)
    enabling collection of sBRDF in the spectral range from 450 nm to 1700 nm. The
    instrument is operated in the relative mode and its traceability to SI is achieved
    with the help of a 2D absolute reference gonioreflectometer available at Aalto
    University. The calibration procedure as well as system’s uncertainty estimation
    are described. The performance of the 3D gonioreflectometer is validated by measurements
    of a ceramic diffuse reflectance sample.</p>
