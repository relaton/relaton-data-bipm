abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The capability to calibrate flow and volume devices dynamically
    has gained increasing interest over the years. Within the scope of the EMPIR project
    17IND13 ‘Metrology for real-world domestic water metering’, several test rigs
    were developed with which dynamic flow profiles can be generated and measured
    that reflect characteristics of real-world drinking water consumption. The dynamic
    component of the test rigs is realized based on different technologies such as
    valves, cavitation nozzles or piston provers. For validation purposes, an intercomparison
    of the test rigs was carried out in the scope of an EURAMET pilot study no. 1506.
    Between September 2020 and February 2021, a transfer standard specially developed
    for the intercomparison was calibrated at eight laboratories. The measurement
    error was determined for three dynamic flow profiles representative of drinking
    water consumption in Europe. In addition to determining the measurement errors
    and the degree of equivalence, five additional key parameters were derived to
    characterize the test rig properties: (1) repeatability of the profile measurements,
    (2) mean value of the residuals, (3) deviation between measured total mass and
    total mass resulting from the given profile and (4) duration of the flow change
    for an increasing change (5) and duration of the flow change for a decreasing
    change. These key parameters comprehensively describe the quality with which the
    dynamic flow profiles were generated and measured on the test rigs and can be
    used for evaluations in future intercomparisons of this kind. A main outcome of
    the intercomparison is that there is no technology to be preferred in terms of
    technical implementation. All test rigs agree well with each other, taking into
    account their expanded measurement uncertainties.</p>'
