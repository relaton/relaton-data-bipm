abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The airborne lunar spectral irradiance (air-LUSI) instrument
    is designed to make low uncertainty measurements of the lunar spectral irradiance
    from an ER-2 aircraft from altitudes above 95% of the atmosphere. Measurements
    cover the visible and near infrared spectral region (350 nm to 1050 nm) and are
    traceable to the international system of units. Five demonstration flights were
    conducted in November 2019 at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center. During
    that campaign, air-LUSI measured the spectral irradiance at lunar phase angles
    ranging from 10° to 60°. This work provides an overview of the air-LUSI instrument,
    the lunar irradiance measurements made during demonstration flights, a description
    of our calibration approach, and summary of the uncertainty budget. Based on the
    flight results and laboratory measurements, we estimate the instrument is capable
    of measuring lunar irradiance, propagated to the top-of-the atmosphere, with combined
    standard uncertainty of 1% (k = 1) or less over the spectral region from 450 nm
    to 980 nm. An examination of the uncertainty budget leads to a path forward toward
    potentially achieving uncertainties of 0.6% in lunar irradiance over much of the
    spectral range for future flights.</p>
