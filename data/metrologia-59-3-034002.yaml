abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A comparison of 11 steel gauge blocks (8 short and 3 long) calibrated
    by absolute interferometry is presented. Thus, the results of the individual measurements
    of five designated signatories (three from INTI and two from CENAM) were analyzed
    in order to evaluate the impact of possible correlations and systematic effects
    in the reproducibility of the measurements. All measurements were carried out
    in the framework of a bilateral key comparison between CENAM and INTI and following
    their own calibration procedures. The measurement analysis was performed by using
    inclusive and exclusive statistics. The agreement between all measurements is
    satisfactory and no detectable systematic effects were observed. Average offsets
    were also calculated for each operator, verifying that systematic effects did
    not affect the measurements of the present exercise. Even though the approaches
    deployed to analyze the results are well-established, this work provides a detailed
    example of analysis in the field of gauge block metrology. This exercise has also
    allowed to validate the internal criteria considered by each institute for selecting
    final results.</p>
