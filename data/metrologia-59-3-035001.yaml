abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, we introduce a robust method for dynamic characterization
    of pressure measuring systems used in time-varying pressure applications. The
    dynamic response of the pressure measuring systems in terms of sensitivity and
    phase as a function of frequency at various amplitudes of the measurand can be
    provided. The shock tube which is the candidate primary standard for dynamic pressure
    calibration at the National Laboratory for pressure, Sweden, was used to realize
    the dynamic pressure. The shock tube setup used in this study can realize reference
    pressure with amplitudes up to 1.7 MPa in the frequency range from below a kilohertz
    up to a megahertz. The amplitude of the realized step pressure was calculated
    using the Rankine–Hugoniot step relations. In addition, the accurate time of arrival
    of the generated shock at the device under test (DUT) was measured using an optical
    probe based on shadowgraphy. The optical detector has a response time in nanosecond
    time scale which is several orders of magnitude faster than the response time
    of any pressure measuring system. Hereby, the latency between physical stimuli
    and response of the DUT can be measured. By the knowledge of the amplitude and
    the accurate time of arrival of the reference step pressure, the transfer function
    of the DUT can be calculated and presented in Bode diagrams of sensitivity and
    phase response versus frequency. The uncertainty in sensitivity and phase measurements
    was estimated. The information provided by this work is useful for developing
    reliable models of dynamic pressure measuring system and provide accurate information
    about their dynamic response. That in turn will contribute to establish a traceability
    chain for dynamic pressure calibration.</p>
