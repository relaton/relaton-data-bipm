abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In the framework of the EU-funded project Met4FoF Metrology
    for the Factory of the Future a method was developed to perform primary magnitude
    and phase calibration of accelerometers. The validation of the developed associated
    hard- and software, which is designed to complement conventional primary calibration
    systems, is demonstrated based on a comparison measurement between the project
    partners CEM and PTB. The results show that the statistical distribution of results
    is only a minor contribution to uncertainty. An evaluation of the comparison based
    on the conventional procedure and established CMCs proofed a good consistency
    between the two laboratories, although the utilized sensor was (only) industrial
    grade quality.</p>
