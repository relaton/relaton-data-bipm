    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In the framework of the EU-funded project <italic toggle="yes">Met4FoF</italic> Metrology for the Factory of the Future a method was developed to perform primary magnitude and phase calibration of accelerometers. The validation of the developed associated hard- and software, which is designed to complement conventional primary calibration systems, is demonstrated based on a comparison measurement between the project partners CEM and PTB. The results show that the statistical distribution of results is only a minor contribution to uncertainty. An evaluation of the comparison based on the conventional procedure and established CMCs proofed a good consistency between the two laboratories, although the utilized sensor was (only) industrial grade quality.</p>
