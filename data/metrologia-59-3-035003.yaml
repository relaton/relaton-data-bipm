abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>By measuring the refractivity and the temperature of a gas,
    its pressure can be assessed from fundamental principles. The highest performing
    instruments are based on Fabry–Perot cavities (FPC). Gas modulation refractometry
    (GAMOR) is a methodology that has the ability to reduce the influence of disturbances
    to such an extent that high-precision (sub-parts-per-million) assessments of pressure
    can be made by the use of FPCs of Invar. To allow for high accuracy assessments,
    it is of importance to assess the uncertainty contribution from the thermodynamic
    effects that are associated with the gas filling and emptying of the cavity (pV-work).
    This paper presents a detailed scrutiny of the influence of the gas exchange process
    on the assessment of gas temperature on an Invar-based dual-FPC (DFPC) instrumentation.
    It is shown that by virtue of a combination of a number of carefully selected
    design entities (a small cavity volume with a bore radius of 3 mm, a spacer material
    with high heat capacitance, large thermal conductivity, and no regions that are
    connected with low thermal conductance, i.e. no heat islands, and a continuous
    assessment of temperature of the cavity spacer) the system is not significantly
    affected by pV-work. Simulations show that 10 s after the filling all temperature
    gradients in the system are well into the sub-mK range. Experiments support that
    refractivity assessments initiated after 40 s are not significantly affected by
    the pV-work. The analysis given in this work indicates that an upper limit for
    the influence of pV-work on the Invar-based DFPC system using 100 s long gas modulation
    cycles is 0.5 mK/100 kPa (or 1.8 ppm/100 kPa). Consequently, thermodynamic effects
    will not be a limiting factor when the Invar-based DFPC GAMOR system is used for
    assessments of pressure or as a primary pressure standard up to atmospheric pressures.</p>
