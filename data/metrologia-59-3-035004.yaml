    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We report the first uncertainty evaluation of NMIJ-F2, the second atomic fountain primary frequency standard at the National Metrology Institute of Japan. To improve the frequency stability, we increase the number of detected atoms to 9 × 10<sup>5</sup> using high-power cooling laser beams for vapor-loaded optical molasses and optical pumping into the Zeeman sublevel <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>
                   <sub>F</sub> = 0. We also employ an ultra-stable cryogenic sapphire oscillator as a local oscillator to prevent the degradation of frequency stability due to the Dick effect. After correcting the collisional frequency shift by alternating atom densities, the frequency stability typically reaches 2.5 × 10<sup>−13</sup>(<italic toggle="yes">τ</italic>/s)<sup>−1/2</sup>. Its value is 1.9 × 10<sup>−16</sup> after 20 days of measurement. Type B uncertainty is typically evaluated at 4.7 × 10<sup>−16</sup>; the largest contribution is from a distributed cavity phase shift, followed by a microwave leakage shift. In long-term comparison, the frequency of NMIJ-F2 is found to be consistent with that of the other primary and secondary frequency standards within the uncertainty.</p>
