abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We report the first uncertainty evaluation of NMIJ-F2, the second
    atomic fountain primary frequency standard at the National Metrology Institute
    of Japan. To improve the frequency stability, we increase the number of detected
    atoms to 9 × 10<sup>5</sup> using high-power cooling laser beams for vapor-loaded
    optical molasses and optical pumping into the Zeeman sublevel m<sub>F</sub> =
    0. We also employ an ultra-stable cryogenic sapphire oscillator as a local oscillator
    to prevent the degradation of frequency stability due to the Dick effect. After
    correcting the collisional frequency shift by alternating atom densities, the
    frequency stability typically reaches 2.5 × 10<sup>−13</sup>(τ/s)<sup>−1/2</sup>.
    Its value is 1.9 × 10<sup>−16</sup> after 20 days of measurement. Type B uncertainty
    is typically evaluated at 4.7 × 10<sup>−16</sup>; the largest contribution is
    from a distributed cavity phase shift, followed by a microwave leakage shift.
    In long-term comparison, the frequency of NMIJ-F2 is found to be consistent with
    that of the other primary and secondary frequency standards within the uncertainty.</p>
