abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper we show how a proper dimensioning of a magnetron
    cavity and its inner bulb allows one to design a hydrogen maser atomic clock with
    an arbitrary low frequency-temperature coefficient (FTC) for its cavity. The control
    of this parameter is of primary importance for the overall stability of the atomic
    clock. To this aim, a model based on finite element method has been developed
    to simulate thermal expansion of hydrogen maser cavities and evaluate the FTC.
    The model has been confronted with direct experimental data and very good agreement
    is observed. A key geometrical parameter is identified that allows for a strong
    tuning of the FTC, so as to set it down to values a priori as close as desired
    to 0, with limitations only dictated by the machining tolerances of the mechanical
    elements of the hydrogen maser cavity.</p>
