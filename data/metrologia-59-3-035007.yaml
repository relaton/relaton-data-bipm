abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A three-cornered hat analysis has been performed on three independent
    time transfer systems between the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and the
    National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These include (1) a direct
    Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) link provided by the USNO,
    (2) an indirect TWSTFT link, and (3) GPS carrier phase (GPSCP) links. Time transfer
    instabilities for individual links, as quantified with the time deviation and
    TOTAL time deviation, have been measured for the first time for averaging periods
    between 2 h and 85 days. Time transfer instabilities beyond one day are roughly
    flicker phase in nature and generally range between 40 ps and 120 ps. Frequency
    transfer instabilities, as quantified by the modified Allan deviation, are observed
    to be as low as 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for a 20 day comparison and into the mid
    10<sup>−17</sup> range at longer comparison times.</p>
