    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A three-cornered hat analysis has been performed on three independent time transfer systems between the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). These include (1) a direct Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT) link provided by the USNO, (2) an indirect TWSTFT link, and (3) GPS carrier phase (GPSCP) links. Time transfer instabilities for individual links, as quantified with the time deviation and TOTAL time deviation, have been measured for the first time for averaging periods between 2 h and 85 days. Time transfer instabilities beyond one day are roughly flicker phase in nature and generally range between 40 ps and 120 ps. Frequency transfer instabilities, as quantified by the modified Allan deviation, are observed to be as low as 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for a 20 day comparison and into the mid 10<sup>−17</sup> range at longer comparison times.</p>
