abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The room temperature dual-mode self-calibrating detector combines
    low-loss photodiodes with electrical substitution radiometry for determination
    of optical power. By using thermal detection as a built-in reference in the detector,
    the internal losses of the photodiode can be determined directly, without the
    need of an external reference. Computer simulations were used to develop a thermal
    design that minimises the electro-optical non-equivalence in electrical substitution.
    Based on this thermal design, we produced detector modules that we mounted in
    a trap structure for minimised reflection loss. The thermal simulations predicted
    a change in response of around 280 parts per million per millimeter when changing
    the position of the beam along the centre line of the photodiode, and we were
    able to reproduce this change experimentally. We report on dual-mode internal
    loss estimation measurements with radiation of 488 nm at power levels of 500 μW,
    875 μW and 1250 μW, using two different methods of electrical substitution. In
    addition, we present three different calculation algorithms for determining the
    optical power in thermal mode, all three showing consistent results. We present
    room temperature optical power measurements at an uncertainty level approaching
    that of the cryogenic radiometer with 400 ppm (k = 2), where the type A standard
    uncertainty in the thermal measurement only contributed with 26 ppm at 1250 μW
    in a 6 hour long measurement sequence.</p>
