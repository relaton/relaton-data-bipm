    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The room temperature dual-mode self-calibrating detector combines low-loss photodiodes with electrical substitution radiometry for determination of optical power. By using thermal detection as a built-in reference in the detector, the internal losses of the photodiode can be determined directly, without the need of an external reference. Computer simulations were used to develop a thermal design that minimises the electro-optical non-equivalence in electrical substitution. Based on this thermal design, we produced detector modules that we mounted in a trap structure for minimised reflection loss. The thermal simulations predicted a change in response of around 280 parts per million per millimeter when changing the position of the beam along the centre line of the photodiode, and we were able to reproduce this change experimentally. We report on dual-mode internal loss estimation measurements with radiation of 488 nm at power levels of 500 μW, 875 μW and 1250 μW, using two different methods of electrical substitution. In addition, we present three different calculation algorithms for determining the optical power in thermal mode, all three showing consistent results. We present room temperature optical power measurements at an uncertainty level approaching that of the cryogenic radiometer with 400 ppm (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 2), where the type A standard uncertainty in the thermal measurement only contributed with 26 ppm at 1250 μW in a 6 hour long measurement sequence.</p>
