abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The widespread availability of high-performance clocks has motivated
    interest in time scale algorithms. There are various time scale algorithms in
    use today, ranging in application from scientific to commercial. The weighted
    average algorithm has been widely used to generate an ensemble time scale. It
    takes one weight for each clock according to the stability or predictability to
    generate the ensemble time scale. However, one weight cannot reflect the long-term,
    mid-term and short-term stability performance of the clock simultaneously. Therefore,
    it cannot improve the long-term, mid-term and short-term stability at the same
    time. To solve this problem, a multi-dimensional weighted average algorithm is
    proposed in this paper, which decomposes the clock difference into three dimensions
    and gets weights in three dimensions to give consideration to improve long-term,
    mid-term and short-term stability simultaneously. The final results of simulation
    and experiment demonstrate that the algorithm proposed in this paper improved
    Allan deviations of 3.94 × 10<sup>−15</sup> on daily and 7.86 × 10<sup>−15</sup>
    on monthly averaging times with respect to those obtained from AT1 and ALGOS,
    respectively.</p>
