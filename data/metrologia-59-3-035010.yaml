    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Precise extraction of sinusoidal vibration parameters is essential for the dynamic calibration of vibration sensors, such as accelerometers. However, several standard methods have not yet been optimized for large background noise. In this work, signal processing methods to extract small vibration signals from noisy data in the case of accelerometer calibration are discussed. The results show that spectral leakage degrades calibration accuracy. Three methods based on the use of a filter, window function, and numerical differentiation are investigated to reduce the contribution of the calibration system noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods with theoretical calculations, simulations, and experiments. The uncertainty of microvibration calibration in the National Metrology Institute of Japan is reduced by two orders of magnitudes using the proposed methods. We recommend to use a combination of numerical differentiation and either a time-domain window function or a bandpass filter for most accelerometer microvibration sensitivity calibrations. For suppressing the effects of line noise, adjusting the data set length is also effective.</p>
