abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Precise extraction of sinusoidal vibration parameters is essential
    for the dynamic calibration of vibration sensors, such as accelerometers. However,
    several standard methods have not yet been optimized for large background noise.
    In this work, signal processing methods to extract small vibration signals from
    noisy data in the case of accelerometer calibration are discussed. The results
    show that spectral leakage degrades calibration accuracy. Three methods based
    on the use of a filter, window function, and numerical differentiation are investigated
    to reduce the contribution of the calibration system noise. We demonstrate the
    effectiveness of these methods with theoretical calculations, simulations, and
    experiments. The uncertainty of microvibration calibration in the National Metrology
    Institute of Japan is reduced by two orders of magnitudes using the proposed methods.
    We recommend to use a combination of numerical differentiation and either a time-domain
    window function or a bandpass filter for most accelerometer microvibration sensitivity
    calibrations. For suppressing the effects of line noise, adjusting the data set
    length is also effective.</p>
