abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Paul Quincey makes a compelling argument for recognizing angle
    as a base quantity with the radian as the base unit. Solid angle is then a derived
    quantity with the steradian a coherent derived unit equal to one square radian.
    The author demonstrates how familiar equations of rotational motion appear to
    result from dimensionally consistent explicit-radian equations by ‘setting the
    radian equal to one’—which he calls the radian convention. Quincey also claims,
    based (solely) on assumed analogies with translational motion, that for rotation,
    the so-called ‘improved’ units for torque, angular momentum and moment of inertia
    must be J/rad, J/(rad/s) and J/(rad/s)<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and that the
    conventional units (N m, kg m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and kg m<sup>2</sup>)
    result from application of the radian convention to these quantities. However,
    based on fundamental physical principles, I show here that, although the radian
    convention may help in understanding a confusing notational change applied to
    angular displacement and its time derivatives when comparing explicit-radian equations
    to their equivalent familiar forms, it cannot be applied to torque, angular momentum
    or moment of inertia. The dimensionally correct SI units for these quantities
    are, respectively, the well-established angle-independent units: newton metre,
    kilogram metre-squared per second and kilogram metre-squared.</p>'
