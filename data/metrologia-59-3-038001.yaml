    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Paul Quincey makes a compelling argument for recognizing angle as a base quantity with the radian as the base unit. Solid angle is then a derived quantity with the steradian a coherent derived unit equal to one square radian. The author demonstrates how familiar equations of rotational motion appear to result from dimensionally consistent explicit-radian equations by ‘setting the radian equal to one’—which he calls the radian convention. Quincey also claims, based (solely) on <italic toggle="yes">assumed analogies</italic> with translational motion, that for rotation, the so-called ‘improved’ units for torque, angular momentum and moment of inertia must be J/rad, J/(rad/s) and J/(rad/s)<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and that the conventional units (N m, kg m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and kg m<sup>2</sup>) result from application of the radian convention to these quantities. However, based on fundamental physical principles, I show here that, although the radian convention may help in understanding a confusing notational change applied to angular displacement and its time derivatives when comparing explicit-radian equations to their equivalent familiar forms, <italic toggle="yes">it cannot be applied</italic> to torque, angular momentum or moment of inertia. The dimensionally correct SI units for these quantities are, respectively, the well-established <italic toggle="yes">angle-independent</italic> units: newton metre, kilogram metre-squared per second and kilogram metre-squared.</p>
