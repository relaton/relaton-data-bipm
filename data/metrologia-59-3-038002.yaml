  content: "<title>Abstract</title>\n<p>The comment by Leonard (2022 <italic toggle=\"yes\">Metrologia</italic>
    \n               <bold>59</bold> 038001) primarily proposes that if angle is treated
    as a base quantity, with the radian as its base unit, it would be wrong to change
    the units for torque (from N m to J rad<sup>−1</sup>), angular momentum (from
    J s to J s rad<sup>−1</sup>) and moment of inertia (from kg m<sup>2</sup> to kg
    m<sup>2</sup> rad<sup>−2</sup>), as was proposed in the letter being commented
    on (Quincey 2021 <italic toggle=\"yes\">Metrologia</italic> \n               <bold>58</bold>
    053002). This reply clarifies the situation by looking directly at the consequences
    of the two proposals. Apart from the comfort of retaining the familiar units for
    these quantities, the benefit of Leonard’s proposal would be the preservation
    of a few favoured equations used in specific situations, while the general relationships
    between many physical quantities would need to change. The revised units proposed
    in the letter would leave all the established general relationships unchanged,
    and are the best option for allowing the longstanding problem of angles being
    wrongly treated as numbers within the SI to be resolved. This reply includes some
    historical context, which describes how Euler implicitly introduced the idea that
    ‘the radian is another name for the number one’ into the mathematics used for
    rotating objects, at a time long before anyone had thought about unit systems.</p>"
