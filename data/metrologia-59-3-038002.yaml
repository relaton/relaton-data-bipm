abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The comment by Leonard (2022 Metrologia \n 59 038001) primarily
    proposes that if angle is treated as a base quantity, with the radian as its base
    unit, it would be wrong to change the units for torque (from N m to J rad<sup>−1</sup>),
    angular momentum (from J s to J s rad<sup>−1</sup>) and moment of inertia (from
    kg m<sup>2</sup> to kg m<sup>2</sup> rad<sup>−2</sup>), as was proposed in the
    letter being commented on (Quincey 2021 Metrologia \n 58 053002). This reply clarifies
    the situation by looking directly at the consequences of the two proposals. Apart
    from the comfort of retaining the familiar units for these quantities, the benefit
    of Leonard’s proposal would be the preservation of a few favoured equations used
    in specific situations, while the general relationships between many physical
    quantities would need to change. The revised units proposed in the letter would
    leave all the established general relationships unchanged, and are the best option
    for allowing the longstanding problem of angles being wrongly treated as numbers
    within the SI to be resolved. This reply includes some historical context, which
    describes how Euler implicitly introduced the idea that ‘the radian is another
    name for the number one’ into the mathematics used for rotating objects, at a
    time long before anyone had thought about unit systems.</p>"
