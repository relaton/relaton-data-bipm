abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>With the redefinition of the international system of units,
    the value of the Planck constant was fixed, similarly to the values of the unperturbed
    ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the<sup>133</sup>Cs atom and speed
    of light in vacuum. Theoretically and differently from the past, the kilogram
    is now explicitly defined as the unit of inertial mass. Experimentally, the kilogram
    is realized by atom count or the Kibble balance. We show that only the former
    method measures the inertial mass without assuming the universality of free fall.
    Under ordinary circumstances, the results obtained by the Kibble balance require
    the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. Therefore, the agreement between
    the two measures can be interpreted as a test of the equivalence principle.</p>
