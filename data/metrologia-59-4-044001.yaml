abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The overall aim of this study is to enable the traceable to
    International System of Units (SI) determination of column-integrated aerosol
    optical depth (AOD) retrieved from the passive remote sensing of the atmosphere
    using SI-traceable direct solar spectral irradiance measurements. A precision
    filter radiometer that measures direct solar spectral irradiance for the retrieval
    of AOD has been characterized and calibrated at the state-of-the-art calibration
    facilities of Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt. The measured SI-traceable
    solar irradiances together with three state-of-the-art top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA)
    solar spectra have been used for retrieving AODs, which were validated against
    the reference AOD instruments of the World Aerosol Optical Depth Calibration Centre
    of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Calibration factors agreed within
    ±0.57% (3σ) using all three TOA spectra except for 368 nm (−1.1%) and 862 nm (1.8%)
    channels for one out of the three TOA spectra. Application of these results to
    the AOD retrieval showed AOD differences with the current reference methods/instruments
    well within the recommended WMO limits. The work provides a first step to opening
    a new era of AOD measurements traceability, providing a link to the SI through
    a laboratory-based approach, with the main advantages being the low uncertainty,
    the possibility of enhancing global AOD homogenization efforts and the chance
    to avoid calibration activities based on instrument relocations.</p>
