abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is increasingly used for dimensional
    metrology, where it can offer accurate measurements of internal features that
    are not accessible with other techniques. However, XCT scanning can be relatively
    slow, which often prevents routine uptake for many applications. This paper explores
    the feasibility of improving the speed of XCT measurements while maintaining the
    quality of the dimensional measurements derived from reconstructed volumes. In
    particular, we compare two approaches to fast XCT acquisition, the use of fewer
    XCT projections as well as the use of shortened x-ray exposure times for each
    projection. The study shows that the additional Poisson noise produced by reducing
    the exposure for each projection has significantly less impact on dimensional
    measurements compared to the artefacts associated with strategies that take fewer
    projection images, leading to about half the measurement error variability. Advanced
    reconstruction algorithms such as the conjugate gradient least squares method
    or total variation constrained approaches, are shown to allow further improvements
    in measurement speed, though this can come at the cost of increased measurement
    bias (e.g. 2.8% increase in relative error in one example) and variance (e.g.
    25% in the same example).</p>
