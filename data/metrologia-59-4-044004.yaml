    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A current focus of the international metrology community is the digitalisation of documents, certificates and services in response to initiatives underway throughout industry and to the requirement to follow the principles of data being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We propose the key elements of a digital framework for the SI metre, at the point of realisation, showing how it may be implemented in practice. We give examples of direct benefits of this approach, which may be extended to other SI units.</p>
