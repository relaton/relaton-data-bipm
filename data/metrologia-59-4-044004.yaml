abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A current focus of the international metrology community is
    the digitalisation of documents, certificates and services in response to initiatives
    underway throughout industry and to the requirement to follow the principles of
    data being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We propose the key
    elements of a digital framework for the SI metre, at the point of realisation,
    showing how it may be implemented in practice. We give examples of direct benefits
    of this approach, which may be extended to other SI units.</p>
