    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In an absolute gravimeter based on optical interferometry, the rotation of a falling body leads to inaccurate gravity measurement. By arranging the center of mass (COM) of the falling body together with its optical center (OC), the rotation error can be minimized rapidly. An optical measurement system with a two-stage pendulum structure is proposed to measure the distance between the COM and the OC of the falling body. The displacement of the OC is measured by an orthogonal interferometer while the falling body twists around the torsion wire, and the rotation angle of the falling body is measured synchronously by a photoelectric autocollimator. It is proved that a twist of the falling body by 2.4 degrees leads to a significant offset of about 0.2 nm along the direction of the laser beam. This results in a limit error of the measurement of the distance between the OC and the COM less than 1 μm. Thus, the rotation error in absolute gravity measurement is reduced to 0.07 μGal.</p>
