abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In an absolute gravimeter based on optical interferometry, the
    rotation of a falling body leads to inaccurate gravity measurement. By arranging
    the center of mass (COM) of the falling body together with its optical center
    (OC), the rotation error can be minimized rapidly. An optical measurement system
    with a two-stage pendulum structure is proposed to measure the distance between
    the COM and the OC of the falling body. The displacement of the OC is measured
    by an orthogonal interferometer while the falling body twists around the torsion
    wire, and the rotation angle of the falling body is measured synchronously by
    a photoelectric autocollimator. It is proved that a twist of the falling body
    by 2.4 degrees leads to a significant offset of about 0.2 nm along the direction
    of the laser beam. This results in a limit error of the measurement of the distance
    between the OC and the COM less than 1 μm. Thus, the rotation error in absolute
    gravity measurement is reduced to 0.07 μGal.</p>
