abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A model for errors-in-variables regression is described that
    can be used to overcome the challenge posed by mutually inconsistent calibration
    data. The model and its implementation are illustrated in applications to the
    measurement of the amount fraction of oxygen in nitrogen from key comparison CCQM-K53,
    and of carbon isotope delta values in steroids from human urine. These two examples
    clearly demonstrate that inconsistencies in measurement results can be addressed
    similarly to how laboratory effects are often invoked to deal with mutually inconsistent
    results from interlaboratory studies involving scalar measurands. Bayesian versions
    of errors-in-variables regression, fitted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
    are employed, which yield estimates of the key comparison reference function in
    one example, and of the analysis function in the other. The fitting procedures
    also characterize the uncertainty associated with these functions, while quantifying
    and propagating the ‘excess’ dispersion that was unrecognized in the uncertainty
    budgets for the individual measurements, and that therefore is missing from the
    reported uncertainties. We regard this ‘excess’ dispersion as an expression of
    dark uncertainty, which we take into account in the context of calibrations that
    involve regression models. In one variant of the model the estimate of dark uncertainty
    is the same for all the participants in the comparison, while in another variant
    different amounts of dark uncertainty are assigned to different participants.
    We compare these models with the conventional errors-in-variables model underlying
    the procedure that ISO 6143 recommends for building analysis functions. Applications
    of this procedure are often preceded by the selection of a subset of the measurement
    results deemed to be mutually consistent, while the more discrepant ones are set
    aside. This new model is more inclusive than the conventional model, in that it
    easily accommodates measurement results that are mutually inconsistent. It produces
    results that take into account contributions from all apparent sources of uncertainty,
    regardless of whether these sources are already understood and their contributions
    have been included in the reported uncertainties, or still require investigation
    after they will have been detected and quantified.</p>
