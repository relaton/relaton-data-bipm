abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The Canadian air-kerma primary standard for<sup>60</sup>Co
    beams is updated according to ICRU report 90 (ICRU-90) recommendations. The effect
    of these recommendations and a more detailed chamber model on the primary standard
    is investigated. Dosimetric quantities and corrections required for the realization
    of air kerma are calculated using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) simulation system.
    The validity of Spencer–Attix (SA) cavity theory as function of Δ, the secondary
    particle production threshold energy, is investigated to assess the accuracy of
    its current selection criterion. Although individual changes in some correction
    factors are statistically non-negligible, the overall effect amounts to only a
    0.04% increase of the standard. The mean restricted mass electronic stopping power
    ratio graphite to air, \n \n S¯Δ,g,a\n \n decreases from the previous value of
    1.0010 to a value of 0.9949. If this value is used with the recommended W<sub>air</sub>
    value of 33.97 eV, the effect on the standard is a reduction of 0.613%. When the
    recommended \n \n WairS¯g,a\n \n value of 33.72 eV is used instead, the change
    results in a 0.835% reduction in K<sub>air</sub>. Using SA cavity theory to obtain
    K<sub>air</sub> with a Δ value of 20 keV, corresponding to the cavity’s mean chord
    length, reproduces a direct MC calculation at the 0.03% level. Type B uncertainties
    due to uncertainty in the photon and electron cross sections for the largest corrections
    K<sub>wall</sub> and K<sub>comp</sub> are estimated to be 0.01% and 0.10%, respectively.
    No statistically significant effect on the standard is observed due to changes
    in the correction factors. Fano tests and comparison to single scattering calculations
    demonstrate EGSnrc’s electron transport algorithm accuracy to be within 0.03%
    relative to its own cross sections. The latter also validates the criterion for
    selecting Δ based on the average chord length of the chamber’s cavity. A 0.2%
    difference in the restricted stopping power ratio obtained in this work and the
    value resulting from ICRU-90 recommendations has the potential for affecting standards
    relying on the absolute value of W<sub>air</sub>, thus further investigation is
    granted. The current update results in a 0.8% decrease of the Canadian<sup>60</sup>Co
    air-kerma primary standard with a reduced uncertainty of 0.2%. This change is
    in excellent agreement with the reported change to the BIPM<sup>60</sup>Co air-kerma
    standard.</p>"
