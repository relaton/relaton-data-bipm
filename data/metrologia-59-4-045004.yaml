abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Carbon dioxide emissions made up from fossil fuel is a weighted
    contribution to the total carbon dioxide emissions in Korea. To keep on track
    of the long-term mitigation pathway, the new solution for enhancing the emission
    flow measurements more accurately in industrial smokestacks is urgent. Thus, along
    with the popular instrument, an S-type pitot tube, three-dimensional (3D) pitot
    tubes have been introduced to determine the emission flow in smokestacks by international
    standards and Korean regulations. To comply with the regulations mandated in Korea,
    the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science established the 3D pitot
    tube calibration system for stack flow measurements assembled to the airspeed
    standard system. This calibration system can produce accurate pitch and velocity
    calibration curves for 3D pitot tubes in the range of testing pitch angle within
    ±30°, and have an expanded uncertainty attributed to the calibration curves (0.005–0.086)
    and (1.3–2.9)% for the prism pitot tube and (0.008–0.175) and (1.6–3.1)% for the
    spherical pitot tube.</p>
