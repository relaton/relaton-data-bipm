abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In inspections for conformity assessment, an acceptance interval
    smaller than the tolerance interval is often determined in order to reduce the
    risk of consumers obtaining non-conforming items in the market. The presence of
    non-conforming items in the market impairs the evaluation of items by customers
    and may have an impact on revenue by decreasing prices. However, setting too small
    an acceptance interval reduces the revenue from the process by decreasing the
    number of the items available in the market. We thus propose a method to determine
    the optimum acceptance interval in conformity assessment by means of maximization
    of the revenue from processes. For this purpose, we give a mathematical model
    for the price of an item and its cost in the production process. Through theoretical
    analysis and simulations, it is shown that a parameter in the price model is the
    key in the optimization. In this paper we report a method for processes where
    no systematic effect component of measurement uncertainty exists, and in part
    2 of this series we will report an extended method in which systematic effects
    are taken into consideration.</p>
