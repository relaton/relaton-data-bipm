abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In this paper, optimization of acceptance interval in conformity
    assessment using the expression of the revenue that we showed in part 1 of this
    study is proposed under the condition of a systematic effect component being present
    in the measurement uncertainty. Systematic effect components are caused by unknown
    biases. Using the distribution based on the uncertainty information of the bias,
    we can develop the distribution of the revenue. Our idea is to set a percentile
    of the revenue distribution as the target of the maximization to reflect the systematic
    effect component in the optimization of the acceptance interval. We provide an
    equation for the optimum acceptance interval that can be numerically solved with
    little burden. We found that the choice of the probability for the percentile
    is an essential task in the optimization. Our proposed method incorporating the
    systematic effect seems to be sufficiently practical to be applied to actual processes.</p>
