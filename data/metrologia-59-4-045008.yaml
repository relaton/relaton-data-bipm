    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Accurate density measurement of molten refractory metals over 3000 K is very challenging, and difficult to achieve with conventional methods. Although containerless techniques have been the most effective and well-established methods to measure the density of molten metals at such high temperatures, a large discrepancy in the containerlessly measured density values has been reported. Here, we identify the uncertainty factors of the density measurement and their influence on the measured density of molten refractory metals over 3000 K using an electrostatic levitator (ESL). We find that intensely focused laser beams can cause rotation-induced deformation of a levitated droplet and thus the large uncertainty in the measured density. Moreover, the combination of sample rotation and precession seriously affects the measurements of density and temperature dependence of density (i.e., volume thermal expansion). By minimizing such rotation and precession, we successfully measure the density and volume expansion coefficient of refractory liquids (tantalum, molybdenum, and niobium) with significantly improved reproducibility and accuracy, and evaluate the uncertainties associated with the density measurement using ESL.</p>
