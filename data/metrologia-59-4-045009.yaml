    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We investigate temperature uncertainty of Coulomb blockade thermometer (CBT) arising from inevitable non-uniformities in tunnel junction arrays. The corrections are proportional to the junction resistance variance in the linear operation regime and this result holds approximately also beyond this originally studied high temperature range. We present both analytical and numerical results, and discuss briefly their implications on achievable uniformity based on state-of-the-art fabrication of sensors.</p>
