abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We investigate temperature uncertainty of Coulomb blockade thermometer
    (CBT) arising from inevitable non-uniformities in tunnel junction arrays. The
    corrections are proportional to the junction resistance variance in the linear
    operation regime and this result holds approximately also beyond this originally
    studied high temperature range. We present both analytical and numerical results,
    and discuss briefly their implications on achievable uniformity based on state-of-the-art
    fabrication of sensors.</p>
