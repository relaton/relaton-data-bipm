abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>This paper describes the NRC measurement set-up and the preparatory
    work for the CCT-K7.2021 key comparison (KC) of triple-point-of-water (TPW) cells.
    The preparatory work at NRC (charged with piloting the KC) included a comprehensive
    testing of the measurement set-up, the definition of the new NRC national standard
    for the TPW temperature, and the evaluation of the uncertainty budgets relevant
    for this KC. The new NRC TPW national standard is composed of an ensemble of ten
    fused silica TPW cells, characterized in both their isotopic composition and impurity
    content. Three uncertainty budgets were evaluated, corresponding to three different
    cases involved in the measurements at the pilot laboratory: (a) the temperature
    difference between two TPW cells, which amounted to 26 μK (k = 2), (b) the temperature
    difference between a TPW cell and NRC national reference, which amounted to 35
    μK (k = 2) and (c) the temperature difference between a comparison participant’s
    transfer cell and the comparison reference, composed of the average of two NRC
    national reference cells, which amounted to 19 μK (k = 2).</p>'
