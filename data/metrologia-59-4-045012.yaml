abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present a method to determine the internal quantum deficiency
    (IQD) of a predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) based on measured photocurrent
    dependence on bias voltage and a 3D simulation model of charge carrier recombination
    losses. The simulation model of silicon photodiodes includes wafer doping concentration,
    fixed charge of SiO<sub>2</sub> layer, bulk lifetime of charge carriers and surface
    recombination velocity as the fitted parameters. With only one set of physical
    photodiode defining parameters, the simulation shows excellent agreement with
    experimental data at power levels from 100 μW to 1000 μW with variation in illumination
    beam size. We could also predict the dependence of IQD on bias voltage at the
    wavelength of 476 nm using photodiode parameters determined independently at 647 nm
    wavelength. The fitted values of doping concentration and fixed charge extracted
    from the simulation model are in close agreement with the expected parameter values
    determined earlier. At bias voltages larger than 5 V at the wavelength of 476 nm,
    the internal quantum efficiency of one of the tested PQEDs is measured to be 0.999 970
    ± 0.000 027, where the relative expanded uncertainty of 0.000 027 is one of the
    lowest values ever achieved in spectral responsivity measurement of optical detectors.</p>
