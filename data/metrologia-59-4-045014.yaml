abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We demonstrate operation of a constant-pressure flowmeter capable
    of generating and accurately measuring flows as low as 2 × 10<sup>−13</sup> mol s<sup>−1</sup>.
    Generation of such small flows is accomplished by using a small conductance element
    with C ≈ 50 nl s<sup>−1</sup>. Accurate measurement then requires both low outgassing
    materials (\n \n &lt;1×10−15\n \n mol s<sup>−1</sup>) and small volume changes
    (\n \n ≈70\n \n μl). We outline the present flowmeter’s construction, detail its
    operation, and quantify its uncertainty. The type-B uncertainty is \n \n &lt;0.2\n
    \n % (k = 1) over the entire operating range. In particular, we present an analysis
    of its hydraulic system, and quantify the shift and uncertainty due to the slightly
    compressible oil. Finally, we compare our flowmeter against a NIST standard flowmeter,
    and find agreement to within 0.5% (k = 2).</p>"
