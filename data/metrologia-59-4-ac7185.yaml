abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Relative humidity (RH) is a fundamental quantity used in many
    fields of engineering and science, and in particular in meteorology and climate
    research. Relative fugacity (RF) and, equivalently, relative activity of water
    vapour in humid air have recently been proposed as a physically well-founded,
    unambiguous common metrological reference quantity for several conventional but
    mutually inconsistent definitions of RH. The RF definition is valid is valid under
    real-gas conditions and above boiling and sublimation temperatures. While differences
    between RH and RF mostly remain within uncertainties of typical present-day RH
    measurements, such systematic discrepancies are expected to be of substantial
    climatological relevance. Consequently, interdisciplinary harmonisation of RH
    definitions is overdue within the SI framework. Dew-point and frost-point temperatures
    are preferred measurands in humidity metrology using, for example, chilled-mirror
    hygrometers. Here, relations are presented for estimating RF from those temperatures,
    based on equations of state of the 2011 IUGG\n               5<p>IUGG: International
    Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, https://iugg.org/.</p> standard TEOS-10, the
    ‘international thermodynamic equation of seawater—2010’. Recommendations are given
    for numerically computing RF using the open-source TEOS-10 SIA library<sup>6</sup>\n
    \              \n               6<p>SIA Library: Sea-Ice-Air Library of TEOS-10,
    http://teos-10.org.</p>. The asymptotic limiting laws of RF for nearly saturated
    humid air exhibit the familiar form of Clausius–Clapeyron-like equations, despite
    departing from ideal-gas assumptions. Under various practical conditions, these
    simple equations may cover the full humidity range with only minor residuals compared
    to the full numerical TEOS-10 solution for RF.</p>"
