abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have developed generalized methods for electrical substitution
    optical measurements, as well as cryogenic detectors which can be used to implement
    them. The new methods detailed here enable measurement of arbitrary periodic waveforms
    by an electrical substitution radiometer (ESR), which means that spectral and
    dynamic optical power can be absolutely calibrated directly by a primary standard
    detector. Cryogenic ESRs are not often used directly by researchers for optical
    calibrations due to their slow response times and cumbersome operation. We describe
    two types of ESRs with fast response times, including newly developed cryogenic
    bolometers with carbon nanotube absorbers, which are manufacturable by standard
    microfabrication techniques. These detectors have response times near 10Â ms, spectral
    coverage from the ultraviolet to far-infrared, and are ideal for use with generalized
    electrical substitution. In our first tests of the generalized electrical substitution
    method with FTS, we have achieved uncertainty in detector response of 0.13% (k
    = 1) and total measurement uncertainty of 1.1% (k = 1) in the mid-infrared for
    spectral detector responsivity calibrations. The generalized method and fast detectors
    greatly expand the range of optical power calibrations which can be made using
    a wideband primary standard detector, which can shorten calibration chains and
    improve uncertainties.</p>
