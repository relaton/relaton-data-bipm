abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The technique of precise point positioning with integer ambiguity
    resolution (IPPP) has been developed for many years and has been shown to significantly
    improve the long-term performance of time and frequency transfer with respect
    to other GNSS-based techniques. In this paper, we present results of GPS IPPP
    links over a period of 22 months for a dozen time laboratories participating to
    UTC. We show that continuous links, in which the continuity of the GPS phase measurements
    is preserved, can be maintained for periods exceeding one year and further extended
    if data from two receivers per station are available. We quantify the frequency
    transfer uncertainty of IPPP by comparison to optical links and show how IPPP
    could improve UTC links to below 1 × 10<sup>−16</sup> relative frequency uncertainty
    over averaging times of up to one month, i.e. the characteristic period of UTC
    publication. Comparisons of primary and secondary frequency standards reported
    for TAI indicate that IPPP could somewhat improve the accuracy of TAI/UTC. Comparisons
    of IPPP to two-way time transfer techniques reveal very long-term ns-size instabilities
    which must be further studied. Use of IPPP for UTC links is possible only if integer
    GNSS satellite products become available with a short delay and we report on such
    experimental products. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of using
    IPPP link in UTC and describe how the necessary steps could be implemented.</p>
