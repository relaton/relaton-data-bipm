abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The primary reference measurement procedure is a method to realize
    the definition of the quantity without relation to a reference standard of the
    same quantity. This paper presents a candidate primary reference measurement procedure
    for the measurement of the amount-of-substance of a complexing agent expressed
    as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) based on coulometric titration. Herein,
    mercury (Hg) was used as the anode because it does not undergo spontaneous oxidation.
    Furthermore, a 1:1 complex is formed between the electrogenerated Hg<sup>2+</sup>
    ions and EDTA (in the form of Y<sup>4âˆ’</sup>). Although the electrochemical oxidation
    of Hg may generate Hg<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> ion, Hg<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>
    undergoes disproportionation in the presence of EDTA, thereby forming the desired
    Hg<sup>2+</sup> species. The equivalence point occurs at the maximum of the derivative
    of the theoretical titration curve. As such, the measurement results were obtained
    by assuming that the maximum of the derivative of the experimental titration curve
    was the end point. The developed procedure was employed for the measurement of
    the amount-of-substance content of the complexing agent in EDTA reference material
    certified at the Slovak Institute of Metrology. The experimental measurements
    agreed well with the certified value for the reference material within the measurement
    uncertainty. The candidate procedure will be useful in certifying EDTA reference
    material and establishing international equivalence of amount content of the complexing
    agent.</p>
