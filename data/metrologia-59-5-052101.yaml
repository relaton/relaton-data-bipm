    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A type-A uncertainty analysis of the magnitude of the local gravitational field can be used to validate type-B uncertainty estimates of calibrations of triaxial accelerometers by rotation in the gravitational field. We demonstrate the application of this method to validate a type-B uncertainty estimate at the sub 0.1% level of the errors introduced by a high-accuracy, two-axis, accelerometer-characterization system.</p>
