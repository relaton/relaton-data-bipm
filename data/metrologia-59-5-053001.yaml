    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We show the implications of angles having their own dimension, which facilitates a consistent use of units as is done for lengths, masses, and other physical quantities. We do this by examining the properties of complete trigonometric and exponential functions that are generalizations of the corresponding functions that have dimensionless numbers for arguments. These generalizations provide functions of angles with the dimension of angle as arguments, but with no reference to units. This parallels most equations in physics which are valid for any units. This property also provides a consistent framework for including quantities involving angles in computer algebra programs without ambiguity that may otherwise occur. This is in contrast to the conventional practice in scientific applications involving trigonometric or exponential functions of angles where it is assumed that the argument is the numerical part of the angle when expressed in units of radians. That practice also assumes that the functions are the corresponding radian-based versions. These assumptions allow angles to be treated as if they had no dimension and no units, an approach that can lead to important difficulties such as incorrect factors of 2<italic toggle="yes">Ï€</italic>, which can be avoided by assigning an independent dimension to angles.</p>
