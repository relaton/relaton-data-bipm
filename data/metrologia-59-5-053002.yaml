    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Nowadays, the use of the (four-wire) automatic resistance bridge is widespread in thermometry, up to the point that it is believed to be the <italic toggle="yes">only</italic> method to measure the resistance of thermometers with the required accuracy. However, before the introduction of this type of bridge, other methods were used in thermometry that, specifically with the comparison of thermometers, may still have their advantages. One of these is the so-called two-wire potentiometric method, described here shortly, where—unlike the four-wire method—all thermometers of the same type are placed in a series configuration, and only voltages are measured with a carefully characterized potentiometer. Additionally, a variant of the method is given which may successfully be applied with future thermometer comparisons.</p>
