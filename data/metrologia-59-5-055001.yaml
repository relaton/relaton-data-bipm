    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Atom interferometry provides an important method of high-precision absolute gravity measurement. As absolute gravimeters, various systematic errors of atom gravimeters have been identified and evaluated. Here a comprehensive evaluation of systematic errors for a transportable atom gravimeter Huazhong University of Science and Technology-Quantum Gravimeter (HUST-QG) is presented. HUST-QG exhibited a short-term sensitivity of 24 μGal Hz<sup>−1/2</sup> and a combined uncertainty of 3 μGal. The operation and evaluation of HUST-QG for transportable gravity measurements during the 10th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters are discussed. And the degree of equivalence for HUST-QG in this comparison is 1.3 μGal, which supports our evaluation.</p>
