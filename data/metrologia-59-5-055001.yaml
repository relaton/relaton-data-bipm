abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Atom interferometry provides an important method of high-precision
    absolute gravity measurement. As absolute gravimeters, various systematic errors
    of atom gravimeters have been identified and evaluated. Here a comprehensive evaluation
    of systematic errors for a transportable atom gravimeter Huazhong University of
    Science and Technology-Quantum Gravimeter (HUST-QG) is presented. HUST-QG exhibited
    a short-term sensitivity of 24 μGal Hz<sup>−1/2</sup> and a combined uncertainty
    of 3 μGal. The operation and evaluation of HUST-QG for transportable gravity measurements
    during the 10th International Comparison of Absolute Gravimeters are discussed.
    And the degree of equivalence for HUST-QG in this comparison is 1.3 μGal, which
    supports our evaluation.</p>
