abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The gravimetric method is widely used to prepare standard gas
    mixtures in gas cylinders. Several dilution steps are required to prepare a low-amount
    fraction gas mixture, such as at μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> level, using the gravimetric
    method. We have developed a new automatic weighing system (AWS) that is applicable
    to a mini cylinder (100 mL or less) to reduce the number of dilution steps. The
    developed mini-AWS is operated by an automatic cylinder exchange mechanism that
    is similar to the existing AWS. However, the minimum measurable mass was decreased
    to measure a small amount of target gas; therefore, the gas mixture can be prepared
    directly at the μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> scale. This study evaluated the fundamental
    performance of the developed mini-AWS, and we gravimetrically prepared several
    gas mixtures of nominal 100 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> carbon monoxide (CO) in nitrogen
    (N<sub>2</sub>). The uncertainties of prepared gas mixtures were consistent within
    0.1% of the relative expanded uncertainty. They were then compared to the standard
    gas mixture, which was gravimetrically prepared using the existing AWS. The compared
    results agreed within their expanded uncertainties (k = 2).</p>
