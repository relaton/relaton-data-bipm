    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper describes the calibration of a high precision AC current measurement device which is required in a system to measure AC voltages up to 800 kV in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 400 Hz. The AC current measurement unit of such a system requires the calibration of the input current in the milliampere range at a frequency of approximately 50 Hz, and all measurements have been made at a suitable frequency of 62.5 Hz. An AC quantum voltmeter (AC-QVM) is used to achieve a traceability chain from DC resistance calibration, when it works as DC quantum standard, and as AC quantum standard for the AC current measurement. All DC and AC measurements needed for one calibration point (one current level) can be done in a rapid sequence within 30 min using the same AC-QVM, such that the combined uncertainty is at a level of 1 μA A<sup>−1</sup> (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic> = 1).</p>
