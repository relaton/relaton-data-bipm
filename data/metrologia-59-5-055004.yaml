abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper describes the calibration of a high precision AC
    current measurement device which is required in a system to measure AC voltages
    up to 800 kV in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 400 Hz. The AC current measurement
    unit of such a system requires the calibration of the input current in the milliampere
    range at a frequency of approximately 50 Hz, and all measurements have been made
    at a suitable frequency of 62.5 Hz. An AC quantum voltmeter (AC-QVM) is used to
    achieve a traceability chain from DC resistance calibration, when it works as
    DC quantum standard, and as AC quantum standard for the AC current measurement.
    All DC and AC measurements needed for one calibration point (one current level)
    can be done in a rapid sequence within 30 min using the same AC-QVM, such that
    the combined uncertainty is at a level of 1 μA A<sup>−1</sup> (k = 1).</p>
