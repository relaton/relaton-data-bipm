abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper presents the evolution of LNE’s impedance bridge
    (Wheatstone bridge) used to calibrate AC resistors defined in the two terminal-pair
    configuration. A new automated Wheatstone bridge, based on four resistances, was
    developed to operate in the full complex plane for resistances ranging from 400 Ω
    to 2 MΩ and for frequencies up to 20 kHz. A commercial dual precision arbitrary
    waveform generator supplies the bridge and PXI modules achieve the balance. Phase
    and frequency synchronization solutions between the arbitrary waveform generator
    source and the PXI modules were used. The choice of these instruments allows the
    bridge to be easily automated and to benefit from recent progress in the development
    of digital-analog converters, in particular those with high frequency sampling
    rates and resolution. The bridge is mainly dedicated to realize the periodic calibration
    of LNE’s standard resistors, used for routine customer calibrations. The traceability
    of LNE’s standard resistors is ensured, firstly, by the calibration of a 1 kΩ
    resistor by comparison to a calculable resistor up to 20 kHz. Then, this resistor
    is used as a reference element to ensure the traceability of all LNE’s standard
    resistors using the new bridge. The validation was done by comparing the results
    obtained, for some resistors with very low drift, with those obtained during calibrations
    performed in 1983, 1995 and 2009. For resistors of 1 kΩ in a 1:1 ratio, the expanded
    uncertainty of series resistance variation and argument are, respectively, less
    than 1.3 µΩ Ω<sup>−1</sup> (k = 1) and 1.2 µrad (k = 1), up to 20 kHz.</p>
