    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A local time scale can be generated by steering flywheel clocks with state-of-the-art optical lattice clocks. This paper presents our simulations about the influence of the optical lattice clock’s operational strategies and the flywheel clock’s noise characteristics on the performance of the generated time scale. By post-processing the measured frequency difference between the optical lattice clock Sr1 and the hydrogen maser HM50 at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), during the modified Julian date (MJD) 59029–59059, a local time scale with 0.68 ns time variation referencing to the TT(BIPM20) is demonstrated.</p>
