abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The pressure behind the reflected shock wave (RSW) in real
    shock tubes deviates from the ideal behavior. This results in lower measurement
    accuracy and thus affects experiments and interpretations. The deviations depend
    on several factors, such as the pressure magnitude, shock tube geometry, and working
    gas. This study investigated it quantitatively and attempted to accurately describe
    its characteristics via the introduction of two parameters: pressure gain and
    pressure rise. To improve the accuracy of the pressure gain measurement, a model
    of the incident shock wave (ISW) attenuation was proposed and the influence of
    the shock tube geometry was explored. The experimental results showed that the
    measurement accuracy was significantly improved: in the cases of 0.07, 0.14, 0.25,
    and 0.30 mm thick aluminum diaphragms, it was improved by approximately 4, 7,
    12, and 22 times, respectively. In addition, a model of the pressure rise dependence
    on the Mach number of the ISW was constructed through a linear fit of the pressure
    rise data. Further, the effects of the working gas on the RSW were examined: the
    results demonstrate that by working with the air the pressure behind the RSW exhibited
    good stability and amplitude.</p>'
