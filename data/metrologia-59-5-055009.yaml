abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Temperature calibration labs all around the world typically
    maintain a set of several triple-point-of-water (TPW) cells for regular measurements
    using the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90). This set often includes
    more-than-10-year-old TPW cells made from a borosilicate glass. In this paper
    we summarize the problems with old borosilicate TPW cells, using the available
    literature data, the results of CCT.K7-2021 key comparison and NRC TPW measurements,
    and highlight the solution to these issues—vitreous-silica TPW cells. The latter
    have an exceptional long-term stability, as we demonstrate by using: (a) comparative
    measurements of the same-age, same-manufacturer vitreous-silica and borosilicate
    TPW cells at NRC in a period from 2007 to 2021, and (b) inductively coupled plasma-mass
    spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of impurities present in the 18 year-old vitreous-silica
    outlier, cell Q325. Remarkably, not only all NRC vitreous-silica TPW cells remained
    stable over a 15 years time period, unlike their borosilicate counterparts, but
    the amount of impurities in the ‘coldest’ cell Q325 (−31 μK from the intercomparison
    reference value) is comparable to that in the newly purchased vitreous-silica
    cells. We argue that the most accurate TPW measurements, such as for defining
    the national TPW references and for the international key comparisons, should
    rely exclusively on vitreous-silica TPW cells.</p>'
