abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We show the implications of angles having their own dimension,
    which facilitates a consistent use of units as is done for lengths, masses, and
    other physical quantities. We do this by examining the properties of complete
    trigonometric and exponential functions that are generalizations of the corresponding
    functions that have dimensionless numbers for arguments. These generalizations
    provide functions of angles with the dimension of angle as arguments, but with
    no reference to units. This parallels most equations in physics which are valid
    for any units. This property also provides a consistent framework for including
    quantities involving angles in computer algebra programs without ambiguity that
    may otherwise occur. This is in contrast to the conventional practice in scientific
    applications involving trigonometric or exponential functions of angles where
    it is assumed that the argument is the numerical part of the angle when expressed
    in units of radians. That practice also assumes that the functions are the corresponding
    radian-based versions. These assumptions allow angles to be treated as if they
    had no dimension and no units, an approach that can lead to important difficulties
    such as incorrect factors of 2Ï€, which can be avoided by assigning an independent
    dimension to angles.</p>
