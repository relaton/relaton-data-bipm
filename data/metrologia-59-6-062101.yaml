    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The unit hectare, meaning hectometre squared, has long been used for expressing measurements of land area. This article describes its history within the metric system and how it came to gain its current status as a non-SI unit that is accepted for use with the SI. As a function of this it has become detached from its parent unit, the are, which is no longer accepted for use with the SI. This situation causes ambiguity for the formation of multiples and submultiples of the hectare. This paper discusses this issue, proposes possible solutions, and concludes that the hectare should be added to the list of non-SI units with which SI prefixes may not be used, similarly to the non-SI units of time. A minor update to the SI Brochure would resolve this ambiguity.</p>
