abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Coordinated universal time (UTC) is the international reference
    for time and frequency measurement, and the basis of civil timekeeping world-wide.
    The reception of signals from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) as a
    source of time and frequency (synchronization and syntonization) has found widespread
    use in virtually all user sectors, including electrical power supply, telecommunications,
    and financial institutions. This paper summarizes the concept of metrological
    traceability and the practices employed in the time and frequency metrology community
    for achieving it. Practical steps are proposed to ensure that traceability to
    UTC from GNSS signal reception is available to a wide community of users, addressing
    different levels of required uncertainty in time and frequency offset from UTC.
    We suggest some practical measures that can be followed by users, and improvements
    to the services provided by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs).</p>
