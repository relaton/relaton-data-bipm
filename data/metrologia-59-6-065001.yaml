abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper describes an onsite comparison of two different digital
    impedance bridges when performing measurements on a quantum Hall resistance standard
    with the purpose of realizing the SI unit of capacitance, the farad. In the EMPIR
    Joint Research Project 18SIB07 GIQS, graphene impedance quantum standards, the
    Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany, developed a Josephson impedance
    bridge, and the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) and the Politecnico
    di Torino (POLITO), Italy, developed an electronic digital impedance bridge. The
    former is based on Josephson waveform generators and the latter on an electronic
    waveform synthesizer. The INRIM–POLITO impedance bridge was moved to PTB and the
    two bridges were compared by measuring both temperature-controlled standards and
    a graphene AC quantized Hall resistance (QHR) standard. The uncertainties for
    the calibration of 10 nF capacitance standards at 1233 Hz are within 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup>
    for the PTB’s bridge and around 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> for the INRIM–POLITO’s bridge.
    The comparison mutually validates the two bridges within the combined uncertainty.
    The result confirms that digital impedance bridges allow the realization of the
    SI farad from the QHR with uncertainties comparable with the best calibration
    capabilities of the BIPM and the major National Metrology Institutes.</p>
