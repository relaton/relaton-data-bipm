abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Analytically the force acting on a current-carrying coil in
    a magnetic field can be calculated in two ways. First, a line integral can be
    conducted along the coil’s wire, summing up the differential force contributions.
    Each contribution results from a cross-product of the corresponding differential
    line segment with the magnetic flux density at that location. Alternatively, the
    coil’s energy in the field is given as a product of three factors, the number
    of turns, the current, and the flux threading the coil. The energy can then be
    obtained by executing a surface integral over the coil’s open surface using the
    scalar product of the differential surface element with the magnetic flux density
    as its integrand. The force on the coil is the negative derivative of the energy
    with respect to the appropriate coordinate. For yoke-based Kibble balances, the
    latter method is much simpler since most of the flux is contained in the inner
    yoke of the magnet and can be written as a simple equation. Here, we use this
    method to provide simple equations and their results for finding the torques and
    forces that act on a coil in a yoke-based magnet system. We further introduce
    a straightforward method that allows the calculation of the position and orientation
    difference between the coil and the magnet from three measurements.</p>
