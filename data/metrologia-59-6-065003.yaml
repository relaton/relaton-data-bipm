abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The general V(λ) mismatch index, \n \n f1′, of a photometer
    quantifies the deviation between its determined relative spectral responsivity,
    \n \n srelλ, and its nominal responsivity, the spectral luminous efficiency function
    for photopic vision, V(λ). LED-based light sources now dominate in general lighting,
    displacing incandescent and fluorescent lamps. Furthermore, the calibration of
    photometers will very likely see the replacement of the reference CIE standard
    illuminant A with CIE reference spectrum L41. The article evaluates the consequences.
    Should we also change the definition of the general V(λ) mismatch index? Based
    on performance criteria, the individual indices are evaluated using various datasets
    with the help of statistical analyses. As a result, the authors can conclude that
    the current definition works very well even under changed calibration and application
    conditions and does not need to be changed. Other evaluated indices for a new
    index definition perform only slightly better in some cases, but do not generate
    generally better properties.</p>"
