abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Aiming at delivering a highly available service, the French
    national optical fiber link network is run mostly unmanned and automatically,
    with the help of a global supervision. However, at a year scale, missing data
    are seemingly unavoidable. Here, we present a first study of the uncertainty of
    coherent fiber links with missing data. We present the tools to assess statistical
    properties for processes which are not strictly stationary, and a simulation of
    optical fiber links depending only on a handful of parameters. We show how missing
    data affects the phase-coherent optical fiber links, and how to mitigate the issue
    with a fill-in procedure that preserves the statistical properties. We apply the
    method for a 5 years-long data set of a 1410 km long fiber link. Second, we apply
    the method to the case of optical clock comparisons, where the downtimes of the
    optical clocks degrade the coherence of the links. We show that our methodology
    of processing the missing data is robust and converges to consistent mean values,
    even with very low uptimes. We present an offset and uncertainty contribution
    from the French fiber network of 2.4 (9.0) × 10<sup>−20</sup>, that is an improvement
    by a factor 5 as compared to a processing without taking the effect of missing
    data into account.</p>
