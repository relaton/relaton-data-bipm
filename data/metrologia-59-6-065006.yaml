    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We present the results of a recent, extensive measurement campaign validating the traceability of the solar irradiance record and Earth radiation budget data. The campaign also established future traceability, thus ensuring confidence in the continuing climate-data record. The total solar irradiance radiometer facility (TRF) at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) Boulder, uses a liquid helium cooled cryogenic radiometer as the reference standard for the validation of spaceflight total solar irradiance (TSI) instrumentation. In 2008 the radiometer was directly compared to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Primary Optical Watt Radiometer (POWR) at a wavelength of 532.12 nm. At TSI power levels, a correction factor of 1.000 306 with an associated standard uncertainty (<italic toggle="yes">u</italic>) of 0.000 098, was reported for the TRF radiometer scale when using external voltage measurement electronics, and not correcting for cavity heating non-equivalence or cavity absorptance. The TRF radiometer has recently been revalidated at LASP using a POWR calibrated silicon photodiode trap transfer standard named TT4. We report a correction factor of 0.999 787, <italic toggle="yes">u</italic> = 0.000 285 to align the TRF radiometer scale with the current NIST POWR scale. A new room temperature reference standard radiometer was established. It measured 133 parts per million (ppm) higher than POWR using the same silicon transfer standard as above, and in a separate direct measurement, 168 ppm lower than the TRF radiometer shuttered at 400 s full shutter cycle. The difference agrees within stated uncertainties. A correction of 0.999 867, <italic toggle="yes">u</italic> = 0.000 247 will align the new radiometer scale with the NIST radiant power scale of POWR.</p>
