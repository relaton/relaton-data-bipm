abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We present the results of a recent, extensive measurement campaign
    validating the traceability of the solar irradiance record and Earth radiation
    budget data. The campaign also established future traceability, thus ensuring
    confidence in the continuing climate-data record. The total solar irradiance radiometer
    facility (TRF) at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) Boulder,
    uses a liquid helium cooled cryogenic radiometer as the reference standard for
    the validation of spaceflight total solar irradiance (TSI) instrumentation. In
    2008 the radiometer was directly compared to the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) Primary Optical Watt Radiometer (POWR) at a wavelength of
    532.12 nm. At TSI power levels, a correction factor of 1.000 306 with an associated
    standard uncertainty (u) of 0.000 098, was reported for the TRF radiometer scale
    when using external voltage measurement electronics, and not correcting for cavity
    heating non-equivalence or cavity absorptance. The TRF radiometer has recently
    been revalidated at LASP using a POWR calibrated silicon photodiode trap transfer
    standard named TT4. We report a correction factor of 0.999 787, u = 0.000 285
    to align the TRF radiometer scale with the current NIST POWR scale. A new room
    temperature reference standard radiometer was established. It measured 133 parts
    per million (ppm) higher than POWR using the same silicon transfer standard as
    above, and in a separate direct measurement, 168 ppm lower than the TRF radiometer
    shuttered at 400 s full shutter cycle. The difference agrees within stated uncertainties.
    A correction of 0.999 867, u = 0.000 247 will align the new radiometer scale with
    the NIST radiant power scale of POWR.</p>
