abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A precise high resistance comparison was performed between the
    traveling dual source bridge developed by the National Metrology Institute of
    Japan (NMIJ) and the adapted Wheatstone bridge of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology (NIST) from 10 MΩ to 100 TΩ at NIST. The NMIJ traveling bridge
    was shipped to NIST Gaithersburg and was installed right next to the NIST bridge
    and these bridges alternately measured the resistance ratio of the high resistance
    standards, without moving the location of the resistors inside the temperature
    controlled air-bath. Having the bridges and resistance standards in the same location
    for the comparison decreased the transportation and temperature coefficient effects
    on the resistance standards, contributing to the excellent agreement of the measured
    values. The NMIJ traveling bridge used an 8.5-digit digital multimeter and a relay
    switch box to determine a resistance ratio by measuring the ratio of the voltages
    applied to the resistors. The comparison was started from 10 MΩ based on the same
    1 MΩ standard resistor calibrated using a NIST two-terminal cryogenic current
    comparator bridge, and standard resistors from 10 MΩ to 100 TΩ were calibrated
    by repeating 10:1 scaling measurements with both systems. Excellent agreement
    was obtained within the uncertainty of all resistance ranges and the difference
    between both systems was less than 1 μΩ Ω<sup>−1</sup> up to 1 TΩ and the degrees
    of equivalence for 10 TΩ and 100 TΩ were less than 6 μΩ Ω<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
