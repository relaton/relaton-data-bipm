abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The stability of induced junction silicon photodiodes used to
    construct the predictable quantum efficient detector (PQED) has been studied over
    a time period of a decade by measurements of its spectral responsivity against
    absolute cryogenic radiometers (CR) in two independent laboratories at CMI and
    PTB. PQEDs operated at room temperature show a long-term temporal stability within
    150 ppm over a broad spectral range during a 10-year period, well within the range
    of the claimed measurement uncertainty values of the CRs. This long term stability
    fulfills one of the fundamental requirements to establish a new primary standard
    for the measurement of power of optical radiation.</p>
