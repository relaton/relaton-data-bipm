abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We have built an ytterbium optical lattice clock with improvements
    over our previous version. An in-vacuum blackbody radiation (BBR) shield is employed
    to provide a well characterized BBR environment. The effective temperature felt
    by the atoms can be determined at an accuracy level of 13 mK, leading to a total
    BBR frequency shift uncertainty of 9.5 × 10<sup>−19</sup>. We have also built
    an ultra-stable optical cavity system to pre-stabilize the clock laser, achieving
    a flicker frequency instability of ∼3 × 10<sup>−16</sup>. Rabi spectroscopy of
    the lattice-trapped atoms can achieve sub-Hertz linewidth spectra. Two ytterbium
    clocks have been operated in an antisynchronized configuration, with real-time
    BBR-Stark-shift corrections applied to both of them. By comparing the two clocks,
    we demonstrate a single-clock instability of 5.4 × 10<sup>−18</sup> in 4500 s.
    This clock will be applied for frequency comparisons to other optical clocks of
    different atomic species in the future.</p>
