abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Double isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
    (ID-ICP-MS) is one of the most important measurement methods in the establishment
    of measurement standards for inorganic analysis. However, there is still no good
    consensus on approaches for uncertainty evaluation in double ID-ICP-MS. Particularly,
    approaches to treating the instrumental isotopic fractionation (IIF) phenomenon
    and correlation between uncertainty sources are diverse and often unclear in the
    literature. Here, an approach for uncertainty evaluation in double ID-ICP-MS measurements
    is described. Using three certified reference materials (CRMs), it is shown that
    the IIF effects cancel out and should not be included in the uncertainty budget.
    Further, a consistent way of considering correlated sources of uncertainty to
    prevent double counting of uncertainties is described in detail along with an
    example of measuring the mass fraction of magnesium in an oyster powder CRM.</p>
