    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>Double isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) is one of the most important measurement methods in the establishment of measurement standards for inorganic analysis. However, there is still no good consensus on approaches for uncertainty evaluation in double ID-ICP-MS. Particularly, approaches to treating the instrumental isotopic fractionation (IIF) phenomenon and correlation between uncertainty sources are diverse and often unclear in the literature. Here, an approach for uncertainty evaluation in double ID-ICP-MS measurements is described. Using three certified reference materials (CRMs), it is shown that the IIF effects cancel out and should not be included in the uncertainty budget. Further, a consistent way of considering correlated sources of uncertainty to prevent double counting of uncertainties is described in detail along with an example of measuring the mass fraction of magnesium in an oyster powder CRM.</p>
