abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>An accurate current can be realized by a series connection of
    an invariant voltage and resistance with zero interconnection resistance in the
    framework of Ohm’s law. In practice, however, accurate current realization is
    limited by the temporal drift and instability of employed resistors, solid-state
    voltage sources and interconnection wires against environmental fluctuations,
    such as temperature or atmospheric pressure. Here, we generated a current of 1
    μA, determined by the Josephson voltage and quantized Hall resistance array (QHRA).
    A programmable Josephson voltage standard (PJVS), 1 MΩ QHRA and ultrastable low
    noise current amplifier (ULCA) are connected in series to generate and measure
    a current of 1 μA. The expected current is calculated as the ratio of the Josephson
    voltage to the QHRA plus the output resistance of the PJVS. The relative difference
    between the current measured by the ULCA and the calculated current is as small
    as 40 nA A<sup>−1</sup> with a combined measurement uncertainty (k = 1) of 0.13
    μA A<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
