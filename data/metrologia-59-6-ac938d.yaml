abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The International System of Units (SI) definition of the ‘second’
    is likely to be redefined in the optical frequency region in the near future.
    Therefore, uncertainty reduction in the frequency link between 10 MHz, which is
    used in the frequency link with an artificial satellite, and the ultrastable laser
    for observing clock transitions in optical clocks, is an important issue for numerical
    determination in the new definition and for International Atomic Time operation
    after the redefinition. We have evaluated all the possible uncertainty factors
    in the frequency link with a femtosecond comb between 10 MHz and an optical frequency
    and obtained the lowest uncertainty yet reported of 3.9 × 10<sup>−18</sup> by
    temperature-stabilizing RF multipliers and by using temperature insensitive coaxial
    cables. Furthermore, we have validated the uncertainty of the frequency link by
    simultaneously measuring an optical frequency of an identical laser using two
    femtosecond combs referenced to a common 10 MHz source and confirmed to be consistent
    with the evaluated uncertainty.</p>
