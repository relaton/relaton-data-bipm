abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>The angular performance of a nano-angle generator (NANGO) developed
    at Diamond Light Source has been characterised using a dual-beam laser interferometer
    designed and built at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). NANGO is a flexure-based,
    piezo actuated device which generates milli- to sub-nano-radian angles for the
    calibration of metrology instruments used to test the quality of synchrotron x-ray
    mirrors and angular nano-positioning stages at Diamond. The NPL interferometer
    provides traceability for small angle measurements made by NANGO. An uncertainty
    budget has been developed for measurements over a 50 nanoradian range. In closed-loop,
    using feedback from the NANGO’s angle encoder, for the first time we show that
    1 nanoradian steps made by NANGO are measurable by an external metrology device.
    The 200 kHz acquisition rate of the NPL angle interferometer also reveals new
    dynamic information about NANGO’s angular motion. The NPL interferometer demonstrates
    that NANGO in open-loop can make: distinct steps of 500 picoradians; sinusoidal
    oscillations at 0.4 Hz with an amplitude of 125 picoradians; or 1 nanoradian oscillations
    at 40 Hz. Traceability to the SI though National Metrology Institute instrumentation
    for NANGO will provide enhanced accuracy for a wide range of angle metrology applications
    at Diamond, including inputs to deterministic polishing techniques for the creation
    of next-generation x-ray mirrors and dynamic characterisation of nano-positioning
    stages.</p>'
