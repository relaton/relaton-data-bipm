  content: "<p>A mercury manometer using capacitance sensing of meniscus positions
    has been refined to give an accuracy within 2 parts in 10<sup>6</sup> of the pressure
    in the range from 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> to 1.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> N/m<sup>2</sup>.
    The determination of pressure ratios is accurate within 1.5 parts in 10<sup>6</sup>
    for pressures in the same range.</p>"
