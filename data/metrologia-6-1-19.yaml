  content: "<p>The wavelengths of the 16 infrared Kr 86 transitions 5s - 5p between
    759 and 975 nm, emitted by a microwave-excited electrodeless lamp, have been measured
    relative to the primary standard. In addition, direct comparisons between the
    wavelengths emitted by the standard hot cathode lamp and two electrodeless lamps
    have been performed for nine wavelengths belonging to five different transition
    groups. The line defining the metre was found to be shifted about 0.05 m<sup>-1</sup>
    to the red when emitted from the electrodeless lamps. The accuracy of the measurements
    is estimated to be about ± 0.01 m<sup>-1</sup>.</p>"
