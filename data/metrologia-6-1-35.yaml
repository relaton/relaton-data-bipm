abstract:
- content: "<p>The normal boiling point and triple point temperatures and the triple
    point pressure of neon were found to be 27.096 ± 0.001 K and 24.553 ± 0.001 K,
    and 43332 ± 13 N/m<sup>2</sup> [325.02 ± 0.10 mm Hg (0 °C)], respectively. (The
    temperatures are in terms of the NBS-1955 provisional temperature scale. The figures
    after the ± symbol indicate estimated uncertainties.) The triple point pressure
    is in accord with the more recent values, but the normal boiling point and triple
    point temperatures deviate significantly from those of previous investigators.</p>"
