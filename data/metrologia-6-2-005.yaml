abstract:
- content: "<p>The triple points of high purity oxygen samples obtained from three
    suppliers has been measured and a discrepancy in excess of 2 mK has been found
    between them. The reproducibility between samples taken from a given source, however,
    was within a few tenths of 1 mK.</p><p>Doping oxygen with small concentrations
    of noble gas impurities has in some cases raised and in others lowered the liquidus
    point.</p>"
