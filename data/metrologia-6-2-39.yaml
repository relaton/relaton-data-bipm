  content: "<p>The precision of radiometry and photometry is reaching a stage, in
    standardizing laboratories at least, where greater attention should be paid to
    losses of flux by diffraction. Otherwise errors of up to 0.5% or more may occur.
    This article reviews from the radiometric point of view diffraction losses at
    circular apertures, for both the Fraunhofer and Fresnel conditions and for both
    monochromatic and complex radiation. Where tedious calculations are required to
    evaluate the exact expression for the diffraction loss, special emphasis is placed
    on approximate relationships.</p>"
