  content: "<p>2 <italic>e/h</italic> has been measured using the ac Josephson effect
    at 36 GHz and the solder-drop type of junction. The final result is that 2 <italic>e/h</italic>
    is 483.5941 ± 0.0010 (2.2 in 10<sup>6</sup>) MHz/μ VNPL 1969. If the 1967 differences
    between the BIPM, NBS and NPL volts are maintained then the value is 483.5938
    ± 0.0011 (2.3 in 10<sup>6</sup>) MHz/μ VBIPM 1969 and is 0.6 ± 3.3 in 10<sup>6</sup>
    higher than the value of Parker <italic>et al</italic>.</p>"
