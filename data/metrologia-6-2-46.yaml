abstract:
- content: "<p>2 e/h has been measured using the ac Josephson effect at 36 GHz and
    the solder-drop type of junction. The final result is that 2 e/h is 483.5941 ±
    0.0010 (2.2 in 10<sup>6</sup>) MHz/μ VNPL 1969. If the 1967 differences between
    the BIPM, NBS and NPL volts are maintained then the value is 483.5938 ± 0.0011
    (2.3 in 10<sup>6</sup>) MHz/μ VBIPM 1969 and is 0.6 ± 3.3 in 10<sup>6</sup> higher
    than the value of Parker et al.</p>"
