    <p>The triple points of high purity oxygen samples obtained from three suppliers has been measured and a discrepancy in excess of 2 mK has been found between them. The reproducibility between samples taken from a given source, however, was within a few tenths of 1 mK.</p>
    <p>Doping oxygen with small concentrations of noble gas impurities has in some cases raised and in others lowered the liquidus point.</p>
