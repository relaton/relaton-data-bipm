  content: "<p>The basic design features and the frequency stability and accuracy
    capabilities of a proposed new frequency standard are projected. The hydrogen
    storage beam tube combines the virtues of the hydrogen maser with those of beam
    tubes and eliminates some of the problems associated with these devices. The projected
    frequency stability for 1 s averaging is better than 10<sup>-14</sup>. The long-term
    stability should be equally good. Ways for investigating the wall shift are discussed.</p>"
