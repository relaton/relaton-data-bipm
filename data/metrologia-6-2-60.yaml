  content: "<p>A new technique of constructing resonant cavities for exciting the
    Ramsey resonance in cesium beam frequency standards is discussed. A centrally
    located E-plane tee is used as the feed system in a symmetric even-order mode
    cavity. The location of the tee is determined initially from measurements made
    on the cavity when operated in a symmetric odd-order mode. Both the theoretical
    conditions and construction methods required to obtain very small phase differences
    between the oscillating magnetic fields at the ends of the cavity are described.
    Experimental results indicate agreement with theory and that the method is effective
    and simple to apply.</p>"
