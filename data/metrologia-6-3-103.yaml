  content: "<p>The boiling point of neon in terms of the NBS 1955 scale of temperature
    is found to be 27.0961 ± 0.00023 K. The experimental procedure is described, together
    with experiments to investigate random and systematic sources of error in the
    determination. It is concluded that this realisation provides a repeatability
    of ± 2.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> K and an absolute error in a single observation of
    ± 3.3 × 10<sup>-4</sup> K. The result indicates that there is no serious shortcoming
    in the IPTS-68 assigned value of 27.102 K.</p>"
