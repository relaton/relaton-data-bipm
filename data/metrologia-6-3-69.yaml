  content: "<p>The realisation of the normal boiling point of neon is an essential
    step in implementing the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968. A
    cryostat designed for this purpose is described, and the results given of detailed
    investigations into the stability and uniformity of temperature achieved. Preliminary
    results are presented of an investigation of the absolute accuracy of the a.c.
    technique used for resistance thermometry. It is concluded that thermal conditions
    in the cryostat should permit a repeatability of ± 10<sup>-4</sup> K, while the
    resistance measurement will not introduce an absolute error greater than 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup>
    K.</p>"
