  content: "<p>A krypton 86 source, used in the recommended way for the emission of
    the primary standard radiation, provides also many other radiations, particularly
    in the near infrared region (λ = 0.7 to 1.2 μm). Among these, nine radiations
    have been selected; they allow to observe interferences up to path differences
    exceeding 1 m, with an accuracy to be compared with the one afforded by the primary
    standard at a path difference of 0.6 m. Their wavelengths have been measured with
    an accuracy of about 3 parts in 10<sup>9</sup> and the broadening and shift effects
    due to the bath temperature and the current density in the discharge have been
    investigated. Only one radiation exhibits a temperature-shift definitely larger
    than the one exhibited by the primary standard.</p>"
