  content: "<p>The NPL Lumen [2793 K] unit is preserved in the calibration of a group
    of gas-filled, tungsten filament, flux standards operating at a colour temperature
    of 2793 K. Its value relative to the NPL Candela [2045 K] has been established
    with an accuracy of ± 0.2% by means of an automatic recording goniophotometer.
    – A subsidiary experiment on high-pressure mercury vapour lamps showed that flux
    measurements using an integrating sphere method are in good agreement with those
    found using the goniophotometer.</p>"
