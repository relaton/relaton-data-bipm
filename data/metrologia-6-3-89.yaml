  content: "<p>The reproducibility of the IPTS-68 as determined by forty-eight thermometers
    is shown to be within approximately ± 3 mK in the range 13.81 K to 20.28 K, ±
    1 mK in the range 20.28 K to 54.361 K, and ± 2 mK in the range 54.361 K to 90.188
    K. In the range 90.188 K to 273.15 K, nine thermometers exhibit a scale reproducibility
    within only ± 5 mK; it is believed that this figure is limited by calibration
    uncertainties, and that ± 1 mK is more likely to be typical.</p>"
