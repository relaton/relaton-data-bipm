  content: "<p>A simple passive cavity CO<sub>2</sub> laser has been designed and
    shown to be ideally suited for length measurement applications, particularly for
    the calibration of long tapes. The laser wavelengths for three CO<sub>2</sub>
    transitions [viz. P (20) and R (18) of the 00°1 - 10°0 transition and R (22) of
    the 00°1 - 02°0 transition] have been measured to one part in 10<sup>6</sup>.
    The refractive index of dry air has been measured at the above three wavelengths
    and found to be 1.0002688 ± 0.0000003.</p>"
