abstract:
- content: "<p>Synchrotron radiation is being investigated as an alternative standard
    to black-body radiation for establishing standards of spectral emission, particularly
    in the ultraviolet. Initial measurements, in which the radiation has been compared
    with existing standards, have shown good agreement between the measured and predicted
    distributions over the range 350 to 600 nm. It is hoped to use the radiation to
    calibrate deuterium lamps, initially down to 200 nm, for use as working standards.</p>"
