abstract:
- content: "<p>The results of an international comparison of thermal neutron flux
    density standards sponsored by the Neutron Working Group of the Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures have been analyzed using a method conceptually different
    from a companion analysis by Axton. Both methods, however, yield closely the same
    results. All individual values are within Â±2.6% of the adjusted value, the average
    absolute deviation being about 1%.</p>"
