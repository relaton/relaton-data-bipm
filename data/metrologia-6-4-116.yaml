abstract:
- content: "<p>The wall shift of the hydrogen maser depends on the collision rate
    and the average phase shift per collision of the atoms in the storage bulb. By
    operating at the temperature where the average phase shift per collision is zero
    it is possible to remove the wall shift. The determination of this temperature
    is made by measuring the wall shift as a function of temperature for two similarly
    coated bulbs offering different collision rates to the stored atoms. The intercept
    of the wall shift vs. temperature curve for the two bulbs-occurs at the zero phase
    shift per collision temperature. To eliminate the possible differences in wall
    coatings the use of a flexible storage bulb is recommended.</p><p>An experimental
    example of the technique is given using two separate bulbs. The data is in good
    agreement with a previous measurement of the unperturbed hydrogen hyperfine frequency
    by H. Hellwig et al.</p>"
