  content: "<p>This paper discusses possibilities which may lead to the development
    of future primary frequency standards of superior accuracy capability. Aspects
    of costs and field-usage are totally neglected. A review is given of the various
    methods and techniques which are currently employed in quantum electronic frequency
    standards or which have a potential usefulness. Various effects which influence
    the output frequency of a primary standard are associated with these methods.
    They are discussed in detail, and expectation values for the related uncertainties
    are given. For selected particles certain methods of interrogation, confinement,
    and particle preparation can be combined such as to minimize the net uncertainty
    due to all applicable effects. Different technical solutions are the result. A
    review of existing and proposed devices is given, including quantitative data
    on the stability and accuracy capability. Aspects of the most promising devices
    are discussed, and it is concluded that accuracy capabilities of 10<sup>-14</sup>
    should be within reach of today's research and development.</p>"
