abstract:
- content: "<p>The US Naval Observatory (USNO) uses clock averaging of about 16 selected
    cesium beam clocks for the derivation of an extremely uniform clock time scale.
    Frequency stabilities of better than 2 × 10<sup>-14</sup> for very long intervals
    are being achieved together with utmost reliability of the time scale. Individual
    clocks differ widely in their performance and are carefully selected for service
    in the USNO clock time scale.</p><p>In this set which is selected according to
    frequency stability, the standard deviation of a clock's average frequency difference
    from the mean is 1.7 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, the standard deviation of the uncorrected
    ensemble mean frequency is 4.4 × 10<sup>-13</sup>. The day to day frequency variation
    of individual clocks is 2.2 × 10<sup>-13</sup> (rms) and the best clock observed
    had a frequency stability of 3 × 10<sup>-14</sup> for 40 day averaging.</p>"
