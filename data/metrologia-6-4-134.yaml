abstract:
- content: <p>Accuracy and precision of parts in 10<sup>7</sup> have been demonstrated
    in a potentiometer which compares dc signals in the 2 to 10 millivolts range from
    Josephson junctions, against the U.S. "legal volt", as maintained by a group of
    standard cells. The circuit comprises two (10 Ã— 100 ohms) Hamon networks in series-to-parallel
    transposition, linked by a calibrated Kelvin-Varley current divider. The critical
    Hamoncircuit contacts are made through mercury-wetted amalgams; the entire circuit
    operates in smoothly stirred oil. Observations indicate the pair of Hamon boxes
    to be initially matched within 0.2 ppm at the operating temperature. Typical standard
    deviation in the day-to-day, run-to-run scatter of Josephson frequency-to-voltage
    ratio, measured with this instrument, is 0.3 ppm or less. Preliminary values for
    the observed ratio are in general accord with the quoted values of Parker et al,
    Petley and Morris and Finnegan et al.</p>
