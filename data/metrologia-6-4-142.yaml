abstract:
- content: "<p>The requirements which enter into the experimental design for the derivation
    of the density of solids by the hydrostatic weighing method are considered. The
    adoption of a precise equi-arm balance to meet the specific criteria for determining
    the density of reference standards of mass ranging in weight from 0.3 to 1.0 kg
    is described.</p>"
