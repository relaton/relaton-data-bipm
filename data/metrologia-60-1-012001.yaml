    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>The medical use of radionuclides depends on the accurate measurement of activity (Bq) for regulatory compliance, patient safety, and effective treatment or image quality. In turn, these measurements rely on the realization of primary standards of activity by national metrology institutes, with uncertainties that are fit for purpose. This article reviews the current status of primary standards of activity for radionuclides used in medical imaging and therapy applications. Results from international key comparisons carried out through the International Bureau of Weights and Measures transfer instruments (SIR and SIRTI) are used to verify that standards for a variety of radionuclides are consistent and conform with practitioners’ expectations.</p>
