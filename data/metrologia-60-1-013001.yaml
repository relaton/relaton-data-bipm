    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>A short history of the development and adoption of the SI prefixes since 1964 is provided, following on from the last time a similar article was written, with special attention paid to the recent extension to the range of SI prefixes following the 27th General Conference on Weights and Measures in 2022. A brief future look is also presented.</p>
