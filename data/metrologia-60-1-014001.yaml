    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>This paper explains the considerations that were important in 1972, when the current leap second procedure was adopted, to maintain a close connection between UTC, the international reference time scale, and UT1—a time scale based on the rotation of the Earth. Although some of these considerations are still relevant, the procedure for adding leap seconds creates difficulties in many modern applications that require a continuous and monotonic time scale. We present the advantages and disadvantages of the leap second procedure, and some of the problems foreseen if it is not reconsidered. We suggest the general outline of a way forward, which addresses the deficiencies in the current leap second system, and which will ensure that UTC remains an international standard that is useful and appropriate for all time and frequency applications. Further discussion and evaluation of the impact of any changes is required.</p>
