abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This paper explains the considerations that were important in
    1972, when the current leap second procedure was adopted, to maintain a close
    connection between UTC, the international reference time scale, and UT1â€”a time
    scale based on the rotation of the Earth. Although some of these considerations
    are still relevant, the procedure for adding leap seconds creates difficulties
    in many modern applications that require a continuous and monotonic time scale.
    We present the advantages and disadvantages of the leap second procedure, and
    some of the problems foreseen if it is not reconsidered. We suggest the general
    outline of a way forward, which addresses the deficiencies in the current leap
    second system, and which will ensure that UTC remains an international standard
    that is useful and appropriate for all time and frequency applications. Further
    discussion and evaluation of the impact of any changes is required.</p>
