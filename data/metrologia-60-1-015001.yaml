abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We developed a new source, having uniform spectral radiance,
    for a large-aperture UV integrating sphere with pressed polytetrafluoroethylene
    coating. Since lamp panel systems have high uncertainty due to a low signal-to-noise
    ratio at 250 nm, to transfer the spectral radiance scale from 250 nm to 350 nm
    to the source, we developed and calibrated a filter radiometer based on a solar
    blind phototube. The spectral radiance was obtained via a model of the source
    and a recursive estimation of the model parameters. A standard FEL lamp validated
    the usage of the filter radiometer. Finally, the filter radiometer to calibrate
    the new source. The results show that the radiance of the source at 250 nm is
    five times the top-of-the-atmosphere spectral irradiance, and the expanded uncertainty
    is 4.7%.</p>
