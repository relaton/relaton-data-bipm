    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>We developed a new source, having uniform spectral radiance, for a large-aperture UV integrating sphere with pressed polytetrafluoroethylene coating. Since lamp panel systems have high uncertainty due to a low signal-to-noise ratio at 250 nm, to transfer the spectral radiance scale from 250 nm to 350 nm to the source, we developed and calibrated a filter radiometer based on a solar blind phototube. The spectral radiance was obtained via a model of the source and a recursive estimation of the model parameters. A standard FEL lamp validated the usage of the filter radiometer. Finally, the filter radiometer to calibrate the new source. The results show that the radiance of the source at 250 nm is five times the top-of-the-atmosphere spectral irradiance, and the expanded uncertainty is 4.7%.</p>
