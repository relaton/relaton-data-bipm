abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>We review primary and working gas flow standards that are used
    to calibrate gas flow meters. For each type of primary standard, we describe the
    principles and practical considerations of its operation and describe one example
    implementation. We identify the practical limits of the example’s performance,
    and, in many instances, we provide an uncertainty budget for a typical flow. The
    reviewed standards span the flow range 2.2 × 10<sup>−7</sup> g s<sup>−1</sup>
    to 520 kg s<sup>−1</sup>. The references point to standards that operate at higher
    and at lower flows. The reviewed standards include volumetric flow standards (piston
    and bell provers, pressure–volume–temperature–time standards, rate of rise standards),
    static and dynamic gravimetric flow standards, and velocity × area standards such
    as critical flow venturis, laser doppler anemometer surveys, and multipath-ultrasonic
    meters. Finally, we describe working standard flow meters used in parallel to
    attain higher flows than economically practical via primary methods.</p>
