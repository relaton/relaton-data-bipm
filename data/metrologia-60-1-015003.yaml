abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The UME KB-3 operating since 2020 allows the realization of
    kilogram under ambient air conditions owing to its distinguishing design and operation
    protocol. This is possible only because the coil pair is stationary but the surrounding
    magnet assembly is moving. The mechanically decoupled nature of the magnet assembly
    allows the implementation of a local vacuum for displacement measurements rather
    than a vacuum covering the entire apparatus. The balance operates in single mode
    with simultaneous operation of weighing and moving phases instead of successive
    phases. A novel dynamical measurement procedure is developed in order to conform
    with the single phase measurements. The paper describes the apparatus and presents
    the measurement results for stainless steel mass artefact with a nominal value
    of 1Â kg. The mass of the artefact is measured with a total relative uncertainty
    of 54 ppb.</p>
