abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>There has been an increased demand for traceable calibrations
    at infrasonic frequencies in support of geophysical monitoring applications, an
    example being the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which provides
    global international coverage for a nuclear testing ban, and requires the International
    Monitoring System. In this paper, a new laser pistonphone design is presented
    with the objective of establishing primary standards for sound pressure at very
    low frequencies down to 10 mHz. The piston is a modified accessorized loudspeaker
    driver whose diameter is equal to the diameter of the front pistonphone cavity.
    The volume velocity of the piston is measured through a laser interferometer and
    the current version was designed to have an upper frequency limit of 20 Hz, to
    overlap with the closed coupler reciprocity method of calibration. Particular
    attention has been given to the sealing to avoid pressure leakage loss. The dimensions
    of the front cavity were designed to allow the calibration of a large variety
    of sensors, including microphones, barometers, manometers and microbarometers.
    Examples of calibrations for several sensors are presented and also an uncertainty
    budget for the Brüel &amp; Kjær type 4160 laboratory standard microphones, commonly
    used for primary calibrations. Finally, the metrological performance of the laser
    pistonphone is demonstrated by comparing the calibration results with those obtained
    with alternative methods.</p>
