abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>In the last few decades, many researchers have been studying
    how hardness measurements can be affected by possible influence variables (i.e.
    velocity of the indenter, dwell times, temperature, etc). This interest is particularly
    motivated by the newly adopted international definitions for the realization of
    Rockwell superficial hardness scales (HR45N, HR30N and HR15N) provided by the
    Consultative Committee for Mass and Related Quantities of Bureau International
    des Poids et Mesures, which deal with all the above-mentioned parameters. In this
    paper, the effect of two such parameters, namely the velocity of the final load
    application and the time interval of the force variation from the preliminary
    force value to the total force value, on superficial Rockwell hardness scales
    at different levels is studied and the related sensitivity coefficients are determined.
    The coefficients obtained are in the order of 10<sup>−3</sup> HR s μm<sup>−1</sup>
    and 10<sup>−2</sup> HR s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, in agreement with other National
    Metrology Institutes (NMIs), i.e. NIST and NPL. However, the uncertainties associated
    by the other NMIs are usually underestimated since they are simply given as the
    standard deviation calculated from the ordinary least squares method for the multiple
    linear regression, or, in other cases, not reported. For this reason, we propose
    a methodology for calculating the uncertainties of the sensitivity coefficients
    via a Monte Carlo method applied to multiple linear regression in order to consider
    the variability of both input and output quantities: with this method, the squared
    uncertainties are given as the squared sum of the standard deviation calculated
    from the ordinary least squares method and the uncertainty contribution due to
    the repeatability obtained via the proposed Monte Carlo method. The proposed method
    yields uncertainties of about 10<sup>−2</sup> HR, while the uncertainties reported
    in other related published papers are in the order of 10<sup>−3</sup> HR.</p>'
