abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We report on an improved absolute frequency measurement of
    the \n \n 5s2S1/2\n \n –\n \n 4d2D5/2\n \n optical transition of a single trapped
    strontium ion using a Global Positioning System (GPS) link to the SI second. Compared
    to our previous measurement, the systematic uncertainty of the optical clock has
    been reduced from \n \n 1.5×10−17\n \n to \n \n 1.2×10−17. The measurement campaign
    was performed over a two-week period in June 2017, with a total measurement time
    of 92 h. The traceability to the SI second through International Atomic Time was
    achieved through a GPS link using the Precise Point Positioning method. The dead
    time uncertainty of the link between the optical clock and the maser was evaluated
    using standard methods based on a model of the maser noise and on the optical
    frequency measurement uptimes. The measured frequency of the<sup>88</sup>Sr<sup>+</sup>
    ion \n \n 5s2S1/2\n \n –\n \n 4d2D5/2\n \n transition is \n \n 444779044095485.49(19)\n
    \n Hz. This result is in excellent agreement with our previous measurements and
    the uncertainty has been reduced by almost a factor of four, from a fractional
    frequency uncertainty of \n \n 1.7×10−15\n \n to \n \n 4.3×10−16.</p>"
