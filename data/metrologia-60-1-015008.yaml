- content: "Abstract<p>We report the absolute frequency measurement of the \n \n 5s21S0→5s5p3P0\n
    \n transition in<sup>87</sup>Sr optical lattice clock (Sr1) at National Time Service
    Center. Its systematic frequency shifts are evaluated carefully with a total relative
    uncertainty of \n \n 5.1×10−17. The measured absolute frequency is 429 228 004
    229 872.91(18) Hz with a relative uncertainty of \n \n 4.1×10−16, with reference
    to the ensemble of primary and secondary frequency standards published in the
    Circular T bulletin by BIPM through a global navigation satellite system link.</p>"
