abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The medical use of radionuclides depends on the accurate measurement
    of activity (Bq) for regulatory compliance, patient safety, and effective treatment
    or image quality. In turn, these measurements rely on the realization of primary
    standards of activity by national metrology institutes, with uncertainties that
    are fit for purpose. This article reviews the current status of primary standards
    of activity for radionuclides used in medical imaging and therapy applications.
    Results from international key comparisons carried out through the International
    Bureau of Weights and Measures transfer instruments (SIR and SIRTI) are used to
    verify that standards for a variety of radionuclides are consistent and conform
    with practitionersâ€™ expectations.</p>
