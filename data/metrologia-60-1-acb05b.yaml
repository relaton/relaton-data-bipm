abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>This Focus Issue of Metrologia was instigated by the Consultative
    Committee for Lengthâ€™s Working Group on Strategic Planning when it met online
    in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Submission of articles started closely thereafter
    and was closed in September 2022. Covering a wide range of topics, the issue shows
    that despite the Coronavirus pandemic disrupting laboratory work, length metrology
    researchers have continued to deliver cutting edge research. The revised definition
    of the metre and its Mise en Pratique, both published in 2019, have stimulated
    further research and opened additional opportunities for developing length metrology
    capabilities. Articles related to the new Mise en Pratique are included in the
    issue, together with a range of articles demonstrating the breadth and ingenuity
    of current leading edge research in length metrology. A final paper indicates
    how metrology, with length used as an example, may be enhanced by a transition
    to a digital framework for realising the SI.</p>
