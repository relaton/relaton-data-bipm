    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report summarizes the results of the measurements performed as a CIPM Key Comparison (CCEM.RF-K27.W) on high frequency power in waveguide among eight National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of Germany (PTB), UK (NPL), France (LNE), China (NIM), Russia (VINIIFTRI), USA (NIST), Korea (KRISS), Japan (NMIJ). The Pilot Laboratory (PL) is NIM. The comparison was performed between May 2019 and December 2021. In this comparison, the effective efficiency and calibration factor of two WR15 (R620) waveguide thermistor mounts (travelling standards) were measured in the frequency range 50 GHz to 75 GHz. In the final report the list of participants, measurement quantities, methods of measurement, and measured results are given. The repeatability of the travelling standards, the key comparison reference values (KCRVs) and the degree of equivalence (DoE) of participating institutions are discussed. The appendix also provides the measurement method, measurement results and uncertainty budget of each participant. To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database <ext-link xlink:href="https://kcdb.bipm.org/" xlink:type="simple">kcdb.bipm.org/</ext-link>. The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
