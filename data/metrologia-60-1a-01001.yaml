abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report summarizes the results of the measurements performed
    as a CIPM Key Comparison (CCEM.RF-K27.W) on high frequency power in waveguide
    among eight National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of Germany (PTB), UK (NPL), France
    (LNE), China (NIM), Russia (VINIIFTRI), USA (NIST), Korea (KRISS), Japan (NMIJ).
    The Pilot Laboratory (PL) is NIM. The comparison was performed between May 2019
    and December 2021. In this comparison, the effective efficiency and calibration
    factor of two WR15 (R620) waveguide thermistor mounts (travelling standards) were
    measured in the frequency range 50 GHz to 75 GHz. In the final report the list
    of participants, measurement quantities, methods of measurement, and measured
    results are given. The repeatability of the travelling standards, the key comparison
    reference values (KCRVs) and the degree of equivalence (DoE) of participating
    institutions are discussed. The appendix also provides the measurement method,
    measurement results and uncertainty budget of each participant. To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database kcdb.bipm.org/. The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p><p>To
