    Main text<p>As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.a and b, a comparison of the 1.018 V and 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the Laboratoire de Métrologie Électrique, DEFNAT (Tunisia), was carried out from April to June 2022. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM_E (ZE) and BIPM_F (ZF), were transported by freight to DEFNAT to be measured and back to the BIPM for checking the stability of the traveling standards. At DEFNAT, the reference standard for DC voltage is a Josephson Voltage Standard (JVS). The output EMF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the primary standard.</p><p>The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the values assigned to DC voltage standards by DEFNAT, at the level of 1.018 V and 10 V, at DEFNAT, U<sub>DEFNAT</sub>, and those assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U<sub>BIPM</sub>, at the reference date of the 15th of May 2022.</p><p>
     U<sub>DEFNAT</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = 0.03 μV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 0.03 μV, at 1.018 V</p><p>
     U<sub>DEFNAT</sub> - U<sub>BIPM</sub> = 0.44 μV;  u<sub>c</sub> = 0.12 μV, at 10 V</p><p>where u<sub>c</sub> is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM and at DEFNAT, based on K<sub>J</sub>, and the uncertainty related to the comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
