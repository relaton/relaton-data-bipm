abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The COOMET.EM-S26 (1715) supplementary comparison of national
    standard instruments in the field of magnetic flux density and magnetic flux measurements
    by sensing coils has been organized within the CCEM framework to test the abilities
    of the metrology institutes to measure magnetic flux density and magnetic flux.</p><p>Five
    NMIs participated in the supplementary comparison COOMET.EM-S26 (1715). Ural Research
    Institute for Metrology (UNIIM) (since 2020 it has been called Affiliated Branch
    of D.I. Mendeleev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM-UNIIM)), Russian Federation,
    acted as the coordinating laboratory of the comparison.</p><p>The comparison on
    DC magnetic flux density and magnetic flux was carried out through the measurement
    of the coil constant of transfer standard coils. In general, very good agreement
    of the results has been observed.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
