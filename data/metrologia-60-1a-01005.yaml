abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>A comparison of high voltage transformer measuring systems
    of TÜBİTAK UME (Türkiye) and PTB (Germany) was conducted between August 2021 and
    August 2022. The comparison was registered as EURAMET Project No: EM 1492 and
    EURAMET.EM - S43 in the BIPM key comparison database. Ratio error and phase displacement
    of the voltage transformers were measured at voltages from 3 kV to 110/√3 kV,
    at 50.2 Hz and 60 Hz. The main targets of the comparison were to underpin and
    strengthen the capabilities of the National Metrology Institutes. The results
    of the participants were found to be equivalent, comparable and in agreement with
    the comparison reference values within stated uncertainties of measurements.</p><p>To

    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCEM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
