    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report describes performing the international supplementary comparisons of the values ​​of colour coordinates and L *, a *, b * of reflecting surfaces transmitted by means of measurement standards - transfer standards from the participants of comparisons to the coordinating laboratory.</p>
    <p>These comparisons were carried out within the framework of the regional metrological organization (RMO) "Euro-Asian Cooperation of National Metrological Institutions" (COOMET) in accordance with the COOMET 743 / UA / 18 Project.</p>
    <p>The National Scientific Center "Institute of Metrology" (NSC "IM", Ukraine) acts as the coordinating laboratory for these comparisons.</p>
    <p>Supplementary comparisons are aimed at determining the degree of equivalence (DoE) for the National Photometric Laboratories participating in these comparisons. The DoE shows the deviation of the color coordinates and L *, a *, b * values ​​of the reflecting surfaces obtained by the Participant from the Reference Values (RV) ​​obtained between the National Photometric Laboratories participating in these comparisons.</p>
    <p>The comparisons will support the following CMCs from the classification of services in photometry and radiometry: color, reflection, Y, x, y,; color, reflection L *, a *, b *.</p>
