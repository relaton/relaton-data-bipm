abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>This report describes performing the international supplementary
    comparisons of the values ​​of colour coordinates and L *, a *, b * of reflecting
    surfaces transmitted by means of measurement standards - transfer standards from
    the participants of comparisons to the coordinating laboratory.</p><p>These comparisons
    were carried out within the framework of the regional metrological organization
    (RMO) "Euro-Asian Cooperation of National Metrological Institutions" (COOMET)
    in accordance with the COOMET 743 / UA / 18 Project.</p><p>The National Scientific
    Center "Institute of Metrology" (NSC "IM", Ukraine) acts as the coordinating laboratory
    for these comparisons.</p><p>Supplementary comparisons are aimed at determining
    the degree of equivalence (DoE) for the National Photometric Laboratories participating
    in these comparisons. The DoE shows the deviation of the color coordinates and
    L *, a *, b * values ​​of the reflecting surfaces obtained by the Participant
    from the Reference Values (RV) ​​obtained between the National Photometric Laboratories
    participating in these comparisons.</p><p>The comparisons will support the following
    CMCs from the classification of services in photometry and radiometry: color,
    reflection, Y, x, y,; color, reflection L *, a *, b *.</p><p>To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCPR,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
