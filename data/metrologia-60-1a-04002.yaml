    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>Optical polygons and angle gauge blocks are the primary artifacts for disseminating the unit of angle to industry. The Consulative Committee for Length (CCL) has designated the calibration of such angle artifacts as a key comparison topic area in order to ensure world-wide traceability and equivalence of angle measurements at the lowest measurement uncertainties. This report describes the key comparison in the topic area of angle metrology for the SIM region. An optical polygon and six angle gauge blocks were measured by five national metrology institutes (NMI). The comparison was successful and the results of the participants are reported. One NMI reported values that were initially inconsistent with the key comparison reference value for the optical polygon.</p>
