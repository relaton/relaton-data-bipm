abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Optical polygons and angle gauge blocks are the primary artifacts
    for disseminating the unit of angle to industry. The Consulative Committee for
    Length (CCL) has designated the calibration of such angle artifacts as a key comparison
    topic area in order to ensure world-wide traceability and equivalence of angle
    measurements at the lowest measurement uncertainties. This report describes the
    key comparison in the topic area of angle metrology for the SIM region. An optical
    polygon and six angle gauge blocks were measured by five national metrology institutes
    (NMI). The comparison was successful and the results of the participants are reported.
    One NMI reported values that were initially inconsistent with the key comparison
    reference value for the optical polygon.</p><p>To reach the main text of this
    paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix
    B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCL, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
