    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>In this supplementary comparison depths of six v-shaped grooves with nominal values 5/20/50/200/600 and 900 μm were measured. The depths were measured according to ISO 5436-1. The PTB nickel depth setting standard was used as reference standard. PTB and MIKES measures all depths, CEM 2 and UME 3 larger depths. The results with associated uncertainties were in agreement.</p>
