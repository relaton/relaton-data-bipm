abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Since 2019, 2 laboratories have submitted 2 samples of<sup>225</sup>Ac
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Ac-225.
    Recently, the POLATOM (Poland) participated in the comparison and a key comparison
    reference value (KCRV) has been calculated. For the first time, the degrees of
    equivalence between each equivalent activity measured in the SIR have been calculated
    and the results are given in the form of a table. A graphical presentation is
    also given.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
