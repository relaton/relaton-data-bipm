abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Three new participations in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.I-131 comparison
    have been added to the previous results and this has produced a revised value
    for the key comparison reference value (KCRV), calculated using the power-moderated
    weighted mean. A link has been made to the CCRI(II)-S6.I-131 comparison piloted
    by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2006, based on the participation
    of CMI-IIR in both comparisons. One NMI used the S6 comparison to update its degree
    of equivalence. The results of two NMIs in the CCRI(II)-S6.I-131 comparison were
    superseded by a more recent APMP.RI(II)-K2.I-131 comparison. The degrees of equivalence
    between each equivalent activity measured in the International Reference System
    (SIR) and the KCRV have been calculated and the results are given in the form
    of a table for the latest results in the BIPM.RI(II)-K1.I-131, and the linked
    CCRI(II)-S6.I-131, APMP.RI(II)-K2.I-131 and EURAMET.RI(II)-K2.I-131 comparisons.
    A graphical presentation is also given.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper,
    click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B
    of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final
    report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
