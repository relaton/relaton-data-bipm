abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Since 1976, 23 laboratories have submitted 44 samples of<sup>134</sup>Cs
    to the International Reference System (SIR) for activity comparison at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), with comparison identifier BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cs-134.
    In the last few years, the POLATOM (Poland), the NRC (Canada), the LNMRI-IRD (Brazil)
    and the PTB (Germany) participated in the comparison and the key comparison reference
    value (KCRV) has been updated. The degrees of equivalence between each equivalent
    activity measured in the SIR or linked to the SIR from the APMP.RI(II)-K2.Cs-134
    comparison and the updated KCRV have been calculated and the results are given
    in the form of a table. A graphical representation is also given.</p><p>To reach
    the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that
    which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
