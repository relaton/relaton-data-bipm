abstract:
- content: Main text<p>In 2017, comparisons of activity measurements of<sup>18</sup>F,<sup>64</sup>Cu,<sup>99m</sup>Tc
    and<sup>11</sup>C using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference
    System (SIRTI) took place at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC, Canada).
    Ampoules containing<sup>18</sup>F,<sup>64</sup>Cu,<sup>99m</sup>Tc and<sup>11</sup>C
    solutions were measured in the SIRTI for about three half-lives (10 half-lives
    for<sup>11</sup>C). The NRC standardized the activity in the ampoules by 4π(PC)β−γ
    anti-coincidence measurements (CIEMAT/NIST liquid scintillation counting for<sup>11</sup>C).
    The comparisons, identifiers BIPM.RI(II)-K4.F-18, BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Cu-64 and BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m
    are linked to the corresponding BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18, BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64 and
    BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparisons. The BIPM.RI(II)-K1<sup>18</sup>F and<sup>99m</sup>Tc
    key comparison reference values have been updated to include the latest BIPM.RI(II)-K4
    linked results and degrees of equivalence for those three comparisons have been
    evaluated.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
