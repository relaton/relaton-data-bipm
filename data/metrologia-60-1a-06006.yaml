    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>In 2017, comparisons of activity measurements of <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>64</sup>Cu, <sup>99m</sup>Tc and <sup>11</sup>C using the Transfer Instrument of the International Reference System (SIRTI) took place at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC, Canada). Ampoules containing <sup>18</sup>F, <sup>64</sup>Cu, <sup>99m</sup>Tc and <sup>11</sup>C solutions were measured in the SIRTI for about three half-lives (10 half-lives for <sup>11</sup>C). The NRC standardized the activity in the ampoules by 4π(PC)β−γ anti-coincidence measurements (CIEMAT/NIST liquid scintillation counting for <sup>11</sup>C). The comparisons, identifiers BIPM.RI(II)-K4.F-18, BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Cu-64 and BIPM.RI(II)-K4.Tc-99m are linked to the corresponding BIPM.RI(II)-K1.F-18, BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Cu-64 and BIPM.RI(II)-K1.Tc-99m comparisons. The BIPM.RI(II)-K1 <sup>18</sup>F and <sup>99m</sup>Tc key comparison reference values have been updated to include the latest BIPM.RI(II)-K4 linked results and degrees of equivalence for those three comparisons have been evaluated.</p>
