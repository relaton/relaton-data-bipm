abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The supplementary international comparison of activity measurement
    of Cs-134 and Cs-137 in brown rice (APMP.RI(II)-S3.Cs-134.Cs-137) was carried
    out within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). The matrix
    of the sample was brown rice grain harvested in autumn 2011, after the accident
    at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. No spiking was applied to the sample.
    Eight institutes reported their measurement results. Averages of the reported
    results and their associated uncertainties were obtained using the power-moderated
    mean. This report describes the supplemental comparison reference value, the degree
    of equivalence of the results, the procedure of the comparison and the sample
    preparation and measurements by the participants.</p><p>To reach the main text
    of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
