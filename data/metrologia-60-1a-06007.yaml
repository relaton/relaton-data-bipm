    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The supplementary international comparison of activity measurement of Cs-134 and Cs-137 in brown rice (APMP.RI(II)-S3.Cs-134.Cs-137) was carried out within the framework of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP). The matrix of the sample was brown rice grain harvested in autumn 2011, after the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. No spiking was applied to the sample. Eight institutes reported their measurement results. Averages of the reported results and their associated uncertainties were obtained using the power-moderated mean. This report describes the supplemental comparison reference value, the degree of equivalence of the results, the procedure of the comparison and the sample preparation and measurements by the participants.</p>
