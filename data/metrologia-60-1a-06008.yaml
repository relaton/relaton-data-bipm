    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A new key comparison of the standards for absorbed dose to water of the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ), Japan, and the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out in the <sup>60</sup>Co radiation beam of the BIPM in February 2022. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for two transfer standards and evaluated as a ratio of the NMIJ and the BIPM standards for absorbed dose to water, is 0.9952 with a combined standard uncertainty of 4.0 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The result agrees within the uncertainties with the comparison carried out in 2009. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
