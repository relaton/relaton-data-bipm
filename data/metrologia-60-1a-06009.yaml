abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The APMP/TCRI Dosimetry Working Group initiated the APMP.RI(I)-K3.2013
    key comparison of measurement of air kerma for medium-energy x-rays (100 kV to
    250 kV); measurements took place between 2015 and 2017. In total, 11 institutes
    took part in the comparison, among which 8 were APMP member laboratories, two
    from AFRIMETS and one from SIM. Three commercial cavity ionization chambers were
    used as transfer standards circulated among the participants. All the participants
    established 100, 135, 180 and 250 kV x-ray beam qualities equivalent to those
    of the BIPM. The ARPANSA and the NMIJ were linking laboratories and two participants
    subsequently made comparisons with the BIPM. The 7 other participants' degrees
    of equivalence fell within 11 parts in 10<sup>3</sup> of unity, well within the
    relevant expanded uncertainty (k = 2) in all cases. Excluding the BARC, the results
    were within 5.7 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>, well within the relevant combined standard
    uncertainty. These results indicated that the calibration capabilities of most
    laboratories were in very good agreement and there were no serious discrepancies
    between them. The effect of implementing the recommendations of ICRU Report 90,
    which occurred on 1 January 2018 (after this comparison), is discussed and we
    deduce that the effect on the degrees of equivalence is negligible. The increase
    in the uncertainty in Wair has been added to all laboratories so that the degrees
    of equivalence and the uncertainties published here are applicable to post-ICRU
    90 measurement results.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
