    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to water standards of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), Australia, and the BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show the standards to be in agreement within the standard uncertainty of the comparison of 6.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p>
