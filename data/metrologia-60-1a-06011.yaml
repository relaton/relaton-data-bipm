abstract:
- content: Main text<p>A key comparison has been made between the absorbed dose to
    water standards of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency
    (ARPANSA), Australia, and the BIPM in accelerator photon beams. The results show
    the standards to be in agreement within the standard uncertainty of the comparison
    of 6.2 parts in 10<sup>3</sup>. The results are analysed and presented in terms
    of degrees of equivalence, suitable for entry in the BIPM key comparison database.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
