abstract:
- content: Main text<p>An indirect comparison of the standards for reference air kerma
    rate for<sup>192</sup>Ir high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy sources of the National
    Physical Laboratory (NPL), United Kingdom, and of the Bureau International des
    Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out at the NPL in June 2022. The comparison
    result, based on the calibration coefficients for a transfer standard and expressed
    as a ratio of the NPL and the BIPM standards for reference air kerma rate, is
    1.0045 with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0043.</p><p>To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCRI,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
