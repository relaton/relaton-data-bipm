    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>An indirect comparison of the standards for reference air kerma rate for <sup>192</sup>Ir high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy sources of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), United Kingdom, and of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) was carried out at the NPL in June 2022. The comparison result, based on the calibration coefficients for a transfer standard and expressed as a ratio of the NPL and the BIPM standards for reference air kerma rate, is 1.0045 with a combined standard uncertainty of 0.0043.</p>
