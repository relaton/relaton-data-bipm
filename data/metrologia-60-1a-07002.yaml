abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>This report describes a key comparison of mass standards APMP.M.M-K5,
    conducted between 19 participating members of the Asia-Pacific Metrology Programme
    (APMP). The APMP.M.M-K5 comparison was launched during the 13th meeting of the
    Technical Committee for Mass and Related Quantities APMP-TCM (2012).Two sets of
    stainless steel weights with five nominal mass values: 2 kg, 200 g, 50 g, 1 g,
    and 200 mg were used as travelling standards. These nominal values were chosen
    as they followed the nominal values of CCM.M-K5. The aim of the comparison is
    to verify the consistency of 2 kg, 200 g, 50 g, 1 g and 200 mg stainless steel
    mass standards among members of APMP-TCM.</p><p>The program was piloted by the
    National Institute of Metrology, P.R. China (NIM). All the participants have provided
    their support and help to successfully organize and run the comparison. The nominated
    19 participants have been divided into five petals and the corresponding five
    sets of transfer standards have been circulated within the groups simultaneously.
    The pilot laboratory measured the volumes and the magnetic properties of the standards
    before the circulation and had reported these values to the participants. The
    pilot laboratory has also verified the stability of all travelling standards for
    more than one year. The set of five weights was circulated among all the participating
    laboratories in August 2015 and received back from the last participant in August
    2016. The final report of this comparison is being given in this document.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
