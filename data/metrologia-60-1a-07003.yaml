abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report describes the second CCM key comparison of realizations
    of the kilogram definition based on the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant,
    which came into force on 20 May 2019. The objectives were to determine the level
    of agreement between realizations of the kilogram using Kibble and joule balances
    and the x-ray crystal density (XRCD) method and to provide input for the calculation
    of the second "consensus value" of the kilogram. The consensus value serves as
    the basis for an internationally coordinated dissemination of the kilogram and
    is updated after each new key comparison. Its use will continue until satisfactory
    agreement between realization experiments has been achieved. Another objective
    was the determination of the reproducibility of the realization experiments by
    comparing the new results with those of the first key comparison of kilogram realizations,
    CCM.M-K8.2019.</p><p>The comparison was organized by the BIPM and had nine participants.
    The BIPM, LNE, METAS, NIST, NRC and UME operated Kibble balances, the NIM used
    a joule balance and the NMIJ and the PTB participated using 28Si spheres, the
    masses of which were determined with the XRCD method. These realization methods
    were used to calibrate 1 kg mass standards under vacuum or in air. The standards
    were sent to the BIPM where they were compared with each other and with BIPM Pt-Ir
    working standards. The latter were calibrated traceable to the International Prototype
    of the Kilogram (IPK), the mass of which served as the definition of the kilogram
    until 20 May 2019.</p><p>The results of the weighings at the BIPM together with
    the measurement results communicated by the participants allowed comparison of
    the values attributed to 1 kg mass standards using the realization experiments
    of the participants. The level of agreement between mass determinations with the
    realization experiments and the BIPM as-maintained mass unit, traceable to the
    Planck constant through the mass of the International Prototype of the Kilogram,
    could also be deduced.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
