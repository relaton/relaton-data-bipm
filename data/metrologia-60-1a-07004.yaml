    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The AFRIMETS.M.T-S1 supplementary comparison has been conducted between NIS (Egypt) and PTB (Germany) at the torque of 500 N·m and 1000 N·m in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. The comparison results revealed the equivalence of torque realized by the 1000 N·m DWTSMs of NIS and of PTB within their measurement uncertainties.</p>
