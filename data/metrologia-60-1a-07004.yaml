abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The AFRIMETS.M.T-S1 supplementary comparison has been conducted
    between NIS (Egypt) and PTB (Germany) at the torque of 500 N·m and 1000 N·m in
    both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. The comparison results revealed the
    equivalence of torque realized by the 1000 N·m DWTSMs of NIS and of PTB within
    their measurement uncertainties.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click

    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the
    provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
