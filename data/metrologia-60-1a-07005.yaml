    <p>Supplementary interlaboratory comparison between European low air speed calibration facilities. Two thermal anemometers have been used as transfer standards and circulated between five participants. The transfer standards selection was based on stable behaviour and sensitivity at very low air speeds. The first anemometer was calibrated by the participants at nominal velocities from 0.05 m/s to 1.0 m/s. The second anemometer was calibrated at nominal velocities from 0.15 m/s to 1 m/s.</p>
