abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Supplementary interlaboratory comparison between European low
    air speed calibration facilities. Two thermal anemometers have been used as transfer
    standards and circulated between five participants. The transfer standards selection
    was based on stable behaviour and sensitivity at very low air speeds. The first
    anemometer was calibrated by the participants at nominal velocities from 0.05
    m/s to 1.0 m/s. The second anemometer was calibrated at nominal velocities from
    0.15 m/s to 1 m/s.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
