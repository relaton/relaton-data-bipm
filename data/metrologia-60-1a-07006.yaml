    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This report describes the results of comparison COOMET.M.H-S3. The comparison measurements between the five participants NSC "IM" (pilot laboratory), PTB, CMI, BelGIM, KazInSt were started in December 2014 and ended in December 2016. In the RMO SC, one set of hardness reference blocks was used consisting of 6 (six) blocks of the Superficial-Rockwell scales and hardness levels 90-94 HR15N, 40-50 HR30N, 76-84 HR30N, 43-54 HR45N, 47-53 HR30TW, 70-82 HR30TW. Agreement between the results of the participants is good.</p>
