abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This report describes the APMP key comparison on the hydrometer
    calibrations, APMP.M.D-K4. This comparison is an APMP regional key comparison
    of CIPM key comparison CCM.D-K4.</p><p>Three hydrometers in the density range
    from 640 kg m<sup>-3</sup> and 1 320 kg m<sup>-3</sup> were used as travelling
    standards. Each hydrometer has a nominal density range of 20 kg m<sup>-3</sup>
    with a scale division of 0.2 kg m<sup>-3</sup>. Eleven laboratories participated
    in this comparison. All laboratories except NMISA are from APMP. NMISA from AFRIMETS
    is also an APMP associate member.</p><p>Each participant reported the results
    of hydrometer calibration using Cuckow's method. The reference temperature for
    the hydrometer calibration was 20 Â°C and the surface tension of the reference
    liquid was given in the protocol for this comparison. KRISS and NMIJ acted as
    pilot and coordinating laboratories.</p><p>The measurement was performed between
    July 2008 and April 2010. The report from participants was completed in February
    2012. The results of this comparison were linked to CCM.D-K4 through the results
    of KRISS, NMIJ, and NMIA.</p><p>NPLI, SNSU-BSN, and NMISA withdrew their results
    while preparing Draft A report of this comparison. The results of two participants,
    MSL and NIM, were inconsistent. However, because it has been more than 10 years
    since the measurements were completed, it is difficult to determine that the results
    reflect the current measurement capabilities of the two participants.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCM, according
    to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
