    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The CCQM-K173 Assay of Sodium Carbonate key comparison was jointly organized by the Inorganic Analysis (IAWG) and Electrochemical Analysis and Classical Chemical Methods (EAWG) working groups of CCQM to test the abilities of the national metrology institutes (NMIs) to measure the purity or amount content of solid bases. They are important challenges for reference material producers, providers of other measurement services, such as proficiency testing schemes. Evidence of successful participation in formal, relevant international comparisons are needed to support calibration and measurement capability claims (CMCs) made by NMIs and designated institutes (DIs).</p>
    <p>Nine NMIs participated in this key comparison CCQM-K173. National Institute of Metrology P. R. China (NIM) and Ural Research Institute for Metrology - Affiliated Branch of the D.I. Mendeleyev Institute for Metrology (VNIIM-UNIIM), Russian Federation, acted as the coordinating laboratories of the comparison.</p>
    <p>The measurement methods used by the participants for measuring the amount content of bases expressed as sodium carbonate were coulometry and titrimetry.</p>
    <p>In general, good overlap of results was observed, the suitability of coulometry and titrimetry for assay of high purity materials was demonstrated. The majority of results were split in two groups differing from each. This bias was however covered by the stated uncertainty estimates. Various effects have been evaluated that may cause it. However, the reason for the bias has not been identified clearly.</p>
