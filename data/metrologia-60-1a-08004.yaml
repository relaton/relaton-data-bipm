abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM-K173 Assay of Sodium Carbonate key comparison was
    jointly organized by the Inorganic Analysis (IAWG) and Electrochemical Analysis
    and Classical Chemical Methods (EAWG) working groups of CCQM to test the abilities
    of the national metrology institutes (NMIs) to measure the purity or amount content
    of solid bases. They are important challenges for reference material producers,
    providers of other measurement services, such as proficiency testing schemes.
    Evidence of successful participation in formal, relevant international comparisons
    are needed to support calibration and measurement capability claims (CMCs) made
    by NMIs and designated institutes (DIs).</p><p>Nine NMIs participated in this
    key comparison CCQM-K173. National Institute of Metrology P. R. China (NIM) and
    Ural Research Institute for Metrology - Affiliated Branch of the D.I. Mendeleyev
    Institute for Metrology (VNIIM-UNIIM), Russian Federation, acted as the coordinating
    laboratories of the comparison.</p><p>The measurement methods used by the participants
    for measuring the amount content of bases expressed as sodium carbonate were coulometry
    and titrimetry.</p><p>In general, good overlap of results was observed, the suitability
    of coulometry and titrimetry for assay of high purity materials was demonstrated.
    The majority of results were split in two groups differing from each. This bias
    was however covered by the stated uncertainty estimates. Various effects have
    been evaluated that may cause it. However, the reason for the bias has not been
    identified clearly.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final
    Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key
    comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been
    peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions
    of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
