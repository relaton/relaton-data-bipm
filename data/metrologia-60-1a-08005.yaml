    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>This article presents the report on the COOMET key comparison COOMET.QM-K120, which is designed as linking to the appropriate CCQM comparison - CCQM-K120.b "Carbon dioxide in air at urban level (480–800) μmol/mol" carried out in 2016-2018.</p>
    <p>CCQM-K120.b is considered as a Track A comparison and tests core skills and competencies required in gravimetric preparation, analytical certification and purity analysis. Participants successful in CCQM-K120.b and the linked COOMET.QM-K120 comparison may use their results in the flexible scheme and underpin claims for all core mixtures in accordance with the GAWG strategy document.</p>
