abstract:
- content: Main text<p>This article presents the report on the COOMET key comparison
    COOMET.QM-K120, which is designed as linking to the appropriate CCQM comparison
    - CCQM-K120.b "Carbon dioxide in air at urban level (480–800) μmol/mol" carried
    out in 2016-2018.</p><p>CCQM-K120.b is considered as a Track A comparison and
    tests core skills and competencies required in gravimetric preparation, analytical
    certification and purity analysis. Participants successful in CCQM-K120.b and
    the linked COOMET.QM-K120 comparison may use their results in the flexible scheme
    and underpin claims for all core mixtures in accordance with the GAWG strategy
    document.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note
    that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
