abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The CCQM-P172 comparison was designed to evaluate the level
    of compatibility of laboratories'' spectroscopic methods for trace gas quantification
    using nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) as a model system. Because it is present in
    NO<sub>2</sub> gas standards as an impurity, HNO<sub>3</sub> was chosen as the
    analyte for study. As primary reference gas mixtures of HNO<sub>3</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>
    are (generally) unavailable for calibration, traceability for spectroscopic measurements
    will rely on the use of referenced molecular parameters (such as tabulated in
    the HITRAN database, acronym for high-resolution transmission molecular absorption
    database).</p><p>Laboratories that took part in this pilot study CCQM‐P172 were
    required to submit one secondary standard of NO<sub>2</sub> in nitrogen at a nominal
    amount fraction of 10 μmol mol<sup>−1</sup> with a requirement that the HNO<sub>3</sub>
    amount fraction present in the mixture is between 100 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> and
    1000 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>. As the mixtures are similar to the ones compared in
    the Key Comparison CCQM-K74.2018, also coordinated by the BIPM during the same
    period, a similar linear decrease of the main component NO<sub>2</sub> and a correlated
    linear increase of the major impurity HNO<sub>3</sub> was initially foreseen.
    The CCQM-P172 protocol was designed to deal with standards that followed a well-behaved
    decay profile, allowing BIPM measurements to be compared to interpolated values
    for participants'' standards. However, as with CCQM-K74.2018, the behavior of
    the standards deviated from this expectation, showing nonlinear variations of
    the components.</p><p>The study was further complicated with deviations from the
    protocol which have been recorded and described in this report. The complications
    resulted in a reduced number of analyses by the coordinating laboratory for two
    of the five participants.</p><p>The first version of this report distributed in
    May 2021 between participants described only the measurements performed by the
    BIPM and the results submitted by participants, without attempting to provide
    reference values. Nevertheless, a number of important observations and conclusions
    were drawn as reported below:</p><p>1) The BIPM operated two methods for FTIR
    quantification of HNO<sub>3</sub>, the first based on direct reference to HITRAN
    parameters, the second based on calibration with a permeation system. Whilst both
    methods demonstrate very good correlation and linearity with respect to each other,
    the HITRAN method provided measurement results 23% higher than for the permeation
    system calibrated FTIR method.</p><p>2) The fitting of HNO<sub>3</sub> FTIR spectra
    was often complicated by the presence of other species, in particular the considerable
    NO<sub>2</sub> absorption band for gas mixtures from cylinders, and the presence
    of considerable amounts of water in the case of the BIPM permeation calibration
    gas mixtures in the 1550 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 1750 cm<sup>-1</sup> spectral window.
    The effect of the spectral windows used for fitting deserves further consideration.</p><p>3)
    Stabilization of the FTIR signal in the BIPM system (45 m gas cell) with the flows
    of gas that are permissible from gas cylinders for HNO<sub>3</sub> resulted in
    residual drift in signal that varied between standards submitted, and in the best
    cases was characterized by an additional uncertainty component with magnitude
    of 20 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> (standard uncertainty), and a compromise between increased
    signal sensitivity and its stability.</p><p>4) Due to the complications in the
    study, the set of results obtained, which had sufficiently complete sets of measurements
    to compare data, were for the cylinders received from NPL and VSL. In the case
    of the NPL standard, BIPM and NPL FTIR measurements were performed with similar
    HITRAN based methods, and agreement of results can be concluded if the rise in
    HNO<sub>3</sub> levels can be considered to have stabilized in the standard at
    the time of measurement at the BIPM. The VSL method fits individual absorption
    lines within a different band from BIPM and NPL. For the VSL standards the absolute
    change in HNO<sub>3</sub> amount fractions between their measurement periods is
    of the same order of magnitude as the uncertainties reported for the BIPM FTIR
    measurement methods. As a result both of the BIPM and the VSL results could be
    considered in agreement, without being able to readily differentiate for which
    of the BIPM results the agreement is better.</p><p>During the GAWG meeting of
    June 2021, participants agreed to complete the study with the following actions:</p><p>•
    reanalysis of participants'' FTIR spectra when feasible: CENAM and NPL spectra
    were reanalysed using the submitted participants parameters, and the recalculated
    nitric acid mole fractions. Unfortunately, NMISA and KRISS could not provide enough
    information to reanalyse their spectra. VSL did not use FTIR for the analysis.
    The reanalysis confirmed good agreement with NPL and revealed differences with
    CENAM.</p><p>• reanalysis using different regions: the impact of fitting HNO<sub>3</sub>
    amount fractions in alternative regions, 1240 to 1400 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1240
    to 1800 cm<sup>-1</sup>, was studied. The maximum difference in amount fractions
    calculated was dependant on the database used.</p><p>• the Pacific Northwest National
    Laboratory (PNNL) database was used as alternative infrared database to retrieve
    HNO<sub>3</sub> amount fractions of calibration mixtures produced by the permeation
    facility. A bias of 6.7 %, contrasting with 23 % identified using HITRAN, was
    found against HNO<sub>3</sub> permeation-based values.</p><p>Based on the measurements
    performed at the BIPM using FTIR calibrated with dynamic standards on one hand,
    and with molecular parameters found in the two databases HITRAN and PNNL, a strategy
    to further calibrate HNO<sub>3</sub> values measured by FTIR in standards of NO<sub>2</sub>
    in nitrogen is proposed. This is based on applying a correction to amount fraction
    values determined by the FTIR-HITRAN method, with the correction factor determined
    from the comparison with values from the Permeation system method, considered
    as the reference method. The corrected FTIR-HITRAN method, with traceability of
    values to the permeation method, can be applied reproducibly, provided that the
    FTIR gas cell''s pathlength is regularly verified, and the spectral region fitted
    is defined.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
