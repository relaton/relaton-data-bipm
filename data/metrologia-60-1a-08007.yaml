abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The CCQM-K172 key comparison on measurement of Specific Adsorption
    A [mol/kg] of Ar on zeolite at liquid argon temperature (to enable a traceable
    determination of the Specific Surface Area by following ISO 9277) has been performed
    by the Surface Analysis Working Group (SAWG) of the Consultative Committee for
    Amount of Substance (CCQM). The objective of this key comparison is to compare
    the equivalency of the National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) and Designated Institutes
    (DIs) for the measurement of specific adsorption of Ar, BET specific surface area)
    of microporous substances (zeolites, sorbents, ceramics, catalytic agents, etc)
    used in advanced technology.</p><p>In this key comparison, a commercial zeolite
    was supplied as a sample. Five NMIs/DIs participated in this key comparison. All
    participants used a gas adsorption method, here argon adsorption at 77.3 K, for
    analysis according to the international standard ISO 9277.</p><p>In this key comparison,
    the degrees of equivalence uncertainties for specific adsorption argon, BET specific
    surface area were established.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click
    on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the
    BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report
    has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to
    the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
