    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>CCQM-K3.2019 was a repeat of the key comparison CCQM-K3 on the composition of automotive exhaust gases. New in CCQM-K3.2019 was the addition of the amount fraction oxygen to the programme. The key comparison reference values were obtained independently, using static gravimetry and appropriate corrections from purity analysis. The key comparison results show equivalence between the measurement standards maintained by the participating national metrology institutes. The demonstrated equivalence can be used to underpin services related to automotive exhaust gases as well as generically through the flexible scheme ("track A").</p>
