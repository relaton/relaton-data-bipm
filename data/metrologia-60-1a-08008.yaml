abstract:
- content: Main text<p>CCQM-K3.2019 was a repeat of the key comparison CCQM-K3 on
    the composition of automotive exhaust gases. New in CCQM-K3.2019 was the addition
    of the amount fraction oxygen to the programme. The key comparison reference values
    were obtained independently, using static gravimetry and appropriate corrections
    from purity analysis. The key comparison results show equivalence between the
    measurement standards maintained by the participating national metrology institutes.
    The demonstrated equivalence can be used to underpin services related to automotive
    exhaust gases as well as generically through the flexible scheme ("track A").</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
