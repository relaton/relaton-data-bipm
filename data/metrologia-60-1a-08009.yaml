abstract:
- content: Main text<p>As part of the ongoing key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison
    has been performed between the ozone national standard of the United States maintained
    by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the common reference
    standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids
    et Mesures (BIPM). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone amount
    fraction range of 0 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to 500 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
