    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>As part of the ongoing key comparison BIPM.QM-K1, a comparison has been performed between the ozone national standard of the United States maintained by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the common reference standard of the key comparison, maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM). The instruments have been compared over a nominal ozone amount fraction range of 0 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to 500 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
