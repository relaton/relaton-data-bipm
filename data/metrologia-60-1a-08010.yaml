abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The key comparison CCQM-K157 for the thickness measurement
    of HfO<sub>2</sub> films was performed by the Surface Analysis Working Group (SAWG)
    of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM). The aim of CCQM-K157
    is to establish the measurement traceability and to ensure the equivalency in
    the measurement capability of national metrology institutes for the thickness
    measurement of HfO<sub>2</sub> films.</p><p>In this key comparison, the thicknesses
    of six HfO<sub>2</sub> films with the nominal thickness range from 0.7 nm to 6
    nm were compared by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray reflectometry
    (XRR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)
    and medium energy ion scattering spectrometry (MEIS).</p><p>To reach the main
    text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text is that which appears
    in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
