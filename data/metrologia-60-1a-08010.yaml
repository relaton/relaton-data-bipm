    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The key comparison CCQM-K157 for the thickness measurement of HfO<sub>2</sub> films was performed by the Surface Analysis Working Group (SAWG) of the Consultative Committee for Amount of Substance (CCQM). The aim of CCQM-K157 is to establish the measurement traceability and to ensure the equivalency in the measurement capability of national metrology institutes for the thickness measurement of HfO<sub>2</sub> films.</p>
    <p>In this key comparison, the thicknesses of six HfO<sub>2</sub> films with the nominal thickness range from 0.7 nm to 6 nm were compared by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), x-ray reflectometry (XRR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and medium energy ion scattering spectrometry (MEIS).</p>

    <p>The final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
