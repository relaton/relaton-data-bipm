abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The key comparison CCQM-K68.2019 was aimed at evaluating the
    level of comparability of laboratories' capabilities for preparing nitrous oxide
    in air primary reference mixtures at ambient amount fractions, in the range 320
    nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to 350 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p>The comparison was coordinated
    by the BIPM and the KRISS. It consisted in the simultaneous comparison of a suite
    of 2n primary gas standards, two standards to be prepared by each of the n participating
    laboratories. Two independent analytical methods were used by the BIPM to analyse
    the amount fraction of N<sub>2</sub>O in air, namely Gas Chromatography with an
    Electron Capture Detector (GC−ECD) and Quantum Cascade Laser Absorption Spectroscopy
    (QCLAS).</p><p>Since the circulation of the Draft A report in April 2021, four
    meetings took place with participants to discuss the mathematical treatment of
    the comparisons results, and several models were proposed. The model chosen by
    participants is the Bayesian Errors−In−Variables regression with shades of dark
    uncertainty. In this final report, the Key Comparison Reference Values were obtained
    with this model, with calculations performed by B Toman and A Possolo.</p><p>The
    key comparison CCQM-K68.2019 is considered to present an analytical challenge
    and therefore classified as Track C comparison in the CCQM nomenclature.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCQM,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
