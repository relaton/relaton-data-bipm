abstract:
- content: 'Main text<p>The Pilot Study CCQM-P206 was conducted in parallel with the
    Key Comparison CCQM-K68.2019, which was aimed at evaluating the level of comparability
    of laboratories'' capabilities for nitrous oxide in air primary reference mixtures
    at ambient amount fractions, in the range 320 nmol mol<sup>−1</sup> to 350 nmol
    mol<sup>−1</sup>. The Pilot Study was set up to allow the participation of the
    Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California San Diego
    (SIO/UCSD) as guest expert laboratory of the CCQM.</p><p>The SIO/UCSD was invited
    by the CCQM in view of its long experience in accurate measurements of nitrous
    oxide in the atmosphere and is the calibration laboratory for this compound in
    the AGAGE (Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment) global measurement network.
    The laboratory has developed a unique method which provides an independent assessment
    of the N<sub>2</sub>O amount fraction compared to participants in CCQM-K68.2019.
    Its participation was also seen as the occasion to contribute to a more general
    reflexion on the compared advantages of two different systems to ensure traceability:
    a unique scale maintained by one central laboratory, or the dissemination of materials
    all traceable to the SI by multiple national metrology institutes.</p><p>The comparison
    CCQM-K68.2019 was coordinated by the BIPM and the KRISS. It consisted in the simultaneous
    comparison of a suite of 2n primary gas standards, two standards to be prepared
    by each of the n participating laboratories. Two independent analytical methods
    were used by the BIPM to analyse the amount fraction of N<sub>2</sub>O in air,
    namely Gas Chromatography with an Electron Capture Detector (GC−ECD) and Quantum
    Cascade Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (QCLAS).</p><p>For the Pilot Study, SIO/UCSD
    provided results of measurements of the N<sub>2</sub>O amount fraction in the
    two standards submitted by the Global Monitoring Laboratory of the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a participant in the Key Comparison. Therefore,
    this study consists in looking at the agreement between SIO/UCSD measurement results
    and the Key Comparison reference value.</p><p>All details on the Key Comparison
    CCQM-K68.2019, including its protocol and its results, can be found in its report.
    This report focuses on SIO/UCSD results and agreement with participants in the
    Key Comparison.</p><p>To reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report.
    Note that this text is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison
    database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The final report has been peer-reviewed
    and approved for publication by the CCQM, according to the provisions of the CIPM
    Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>'
