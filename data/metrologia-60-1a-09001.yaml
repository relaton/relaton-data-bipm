abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The key comparison CCAUV.A-K6 has been carried out under the
    auspices of the Consultative Committee on Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration
    (CCAUV) of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM). This comparison
    is concerned with primary pressure calibration of laboratory standard microphones
    type LS2P. The participating NMI's are HBK-DPLA (Denmark), CENAM (Mexico), GUM
    (Poland), INMETRO (Brazil), KRISS (Korea), LNE (France), METAS (Switzerland),
    NMIA (Australia), NMIJ (Japan), NMISA (South Africa), NRC (Canada), UME (Turkey)
    and VNIIFTRI (Russia). The role of Pilot laboratory was undertaken by LNE (France).
    The measurements took place between March 2019 and December 2020. Two LS2P microphones
    were circulated. This report includes the measurement results from the participants,
    information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignment
    of the Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRV) and Degrees of Equivalence (DoE).</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
