    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The key comparison CCAUV.A-K6 has been carried out under the auspices of the Consultative Committee on Acoustics, Ultrasound and Vibration (CCAUV) of the International Committee of Weights and Measures (CIPM). This comparison is concerned with primary pressure calibration of laboratory standard microphones type LS2P. The participating NMI's are HBK-DPLA (Denmark), CENAM (Mexico), GUM (Poland), INMETRO (Brazil), KRISS (Korea), LNE (France), METAS (Switzerland), NMIA (Australia), NMIJ (Japan), NMISA (South Africa), NRC (Canada), UME (Turkey) and VNIIFTRI (Russia). The role of Pilot laboratory was undertaken by LNE (France). The measurements took place between March 2019 and December 2020. Two LS2P microphones were circulated. This report includes the measurement results from the participants, information about their calibration methods, and the analysis leading to the assignment of the Key Comparison Reference Values (KCRV) and Degrees of Equivalence (DoE).</p>
