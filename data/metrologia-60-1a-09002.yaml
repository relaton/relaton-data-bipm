    <title>Main text</title>
    <p>The results of the fifth EURAMET key comparison in the area of primary vibration calibration of the complex sensitivity, here concerning sinusoidal acceleration, are presented. This regional key comparison followed the previous CCAUV comparison over the extended frequency range from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. Measurement results reported by 11 participants for magnitude and phase shift of complex charge sensitivity of single ended and back-to-back accelerometers were compared. A link to the CCAUV.V-K5 with the respective Degrees of Equivalence is reported.</p>
