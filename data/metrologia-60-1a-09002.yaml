abstract:
- content: Main text<p>The results of the fifth EURAMET key comparison in the area
    of primary vibration calibration of the complex sensitivity, here concerning sinusoidal
    acceleration, are presented. This regional key comparison followed the previous
    CCAUV comparison over the extended frequency range from 10 Hz to 20 kHz. Measurement
    results reported by 11 participants for magnitude and phase shift of complex charge
    sensitivity of single ended and back-to-back accelerometers were compared. A link
    to the CCAUV.V-K5 with the respective Degrees of Equivalence is reported.</p><p>To
    reach the main text of this paper, click on Final Report. Note that this text
    is that which appears in Appendix B of the BIPM key comparison database https://www.bipm.org/kcdb/.</p><p>The
    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV,
    according to the provisions of the CIPM Mutual Recognition Arrangement (CIPM MRA).</p>
