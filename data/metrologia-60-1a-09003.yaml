abstract:
- content: Main text<p>Results of Regional Metrology Organisation supplementary comparison
    AFRIMETS.AUV.A-S2 concerning the calibration of a Brüel &amp; Kjær 4226 multi-frequency
    sound calibrator are reported here. Sound pressure level results at frequencies
    from 31.5 Hz to 16 kHz and nominal sound level settings of 94 dB and 114 dB, were
    evaluated for consistency, the calculated comparison reference values and Degrees
    of Equivalence are reported here. The comparison's purpose was to prove technical
    capabilities supporting the submissions of calibration measurement capabilities
    in the BIPM key comparison database. The light shines quite far, the new calibration
    measurement capabilities that may result from this work underpin some important
    fundamental acoustic calibration services, e.g., sound calibrators, sound level
    meters and personal sound exposure meters. These instruments are intrinsic to
    the effective monitoring and implementation worldwide of human hearing conservation
    and hearing loss assessment programs, all of which impacts quality of life. According
    to the World Health Organization, nearly 1.5 billion people experience some decline
    in their hearing capacity during their lives [1].</p><p>To reach the main text

    final report has been peer-reviewed and approved for publication by the CCAUV,
