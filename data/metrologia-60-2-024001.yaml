    which was recommended by CODATA in Tiesinga <italic toggle=\"yes\">et al</italic>
    (2018 <italic toggle=\"yes\">J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data</italic> \n               <bold>50</bold>
    033105). The CODATA value has an assigned uncertainty of 22 ppm and the reported
    uncertainties in the BIPM values were 41 ppm and 25 ppm, respectively. The discrepancy
    therefore amounts to about seven times the combined uncertainty of the latest
    BIPM and CODATA values. We examine experimentally the hypothesis that the difference
    is due to a bias produced by stray alternating (AC) magnetic fields in the vicinity
    of the experiment. Whilst the BIPM torsion balance was located at the University
    of Birmingham a coil, having a similar scale to the balance, was used to generate
    AC magnetic fields of magnitude approximately 1 μT which in turn produced torques
    of magnitude approximately 0.2 % of the gravity torque. The magnitudes of these
    torques were compared with simple analytical models and finite element analyses.
    Measurements in the laboratory in Birmingham and, more recently, at BIPM give
    a very conservative upper limit on the rms magnitude of ambient AC magnetic fields
    of 100 nT. As the torque was demonstrated to vary with the square of the ambient
    field, these observations and our analyses suggest an upper limit to the possible
    bias in the BIPM determinations of the order of 20 ppm. It is therefore unlikely
    that torques due to ambient magnetic fields could have significantly biased values
    of <italic toggle=\"yes\">G</italic> determined at BIPM.</p>"
