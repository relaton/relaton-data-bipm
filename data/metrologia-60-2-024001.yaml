abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>The values of Newton’s constant of gravitation, G, reported
    by determinations at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in
    Quinn et al (2001 Phys. Rev. Lett. \n               87 111101/1–111101/4) and
    in Quinn et al (2013 Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A \n               372 2–28) are some
    200 parts per million (ppm) larger than the value of \n                  \n                  6.67430×10−11\n
    \                 \n                m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−2</sup>
    which was recommended by CODATA in Tiesinga et al (2018 J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data
    \n               50 033105). The CODATA value has an assigned uncertainty of 22
    ppm and the reported uncertainties in the BIPM values were 41 ppm and 25 ppm,
    respectively. The discrepancy therefore amounts to about seven times the combined
    uncertainty of the latest BIPM and CODATA values. We examine experimentally the
    hypothesis that the difference is due to a bias produced by stray alternating
    (AC) magnetic fields in the vicinity of the experiment. Whilst the BIPM torsion
    balance was located at the University of Birmingham a coil, having a similar scale
    to the balance, was used to generate AC magnetic fields of magnitude approximately
    1 μT which in turn produced torques of magnitude approximately 0.2 % of the gravity
    torque. The magnitudes of these torques were compared with simple analytical models
    and finite element analyses. Measurements in the laboratory in Birmingham and,
    more recently, at BIPM give a very conservative upper limit on the rms magnitude
    of ambient AC magnetic fields of 100 nT. As the torque was demonstrated to vary
    with the square of the ambient field, these observations and our analyses suggest
    an upper limit to the possible bias in the BIPM determinations of the order of
    20 ppm. It is therefore unlikely that torques due to ambient magnetic fields could
    have significantly biased values of G determined at BIPM.</p>"
