abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Light-emitting diode (LED) is now the main type of light source
    in global lighting marketing. However, traditional photometry with the incandescent
    standard lamp is not sufficient to implement high-level LED photometric measurement,
    since a considerable spectral mismatch error may exist if the photometer has a
    large general V(λ) mismatch index \n \n f1′. The LED standard lamp is proposed
    to be the complementary transfer standard for photometry to reduce this measurement
    uncertainty. National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) has previously reported
    a type of LED filament lamp for total luminous flux. In this article, NIM demonstrates
    another type of LED filament lamp for luminous intensity calibration. The LED
    filaments are sealed in a T90 cylinder glass bulb as emitters, and have a spectrum
    similar to the reference white LED spectrum considered in Commission on Illumination
    technical committee 2–90. The LED lamp uses the E27 screw base as the connector,
    and is compatible with the traditional alignment approaches. The warm-up time
    is less than 12 min. The output change of a group of 12 lamps, over nearly two
    years of storage and 1 h operation every day during the whole long-term test,
    is found to be ±0.2% or less for most of the lamps. The ageing effect of one lamp
    over a continuous 6500 h of burning is estimated to be −0.014% per 100 h, and
    it is significantly lower than 1% per 100 h, the typical drift rate of the traditional
    incandescent luminous intensity lamp. In the aspect of the coincidence with inverse
    square law, the LED lamp has a similar performance to the WI41/G lamp, the traditional
    luminous intensity lamp.</p>"
