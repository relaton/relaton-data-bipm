abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Photon emission intensities of radionuclides, i.e. the number
    of emitted photons per decay, are the single most important decay data when the
    photon spectrometry technique is employed in ionizing radiation metrology. However,
    their precise measurement is problematic because they are usually determined by
    photon spectrometry with spectrometers having a detection efficiency calibrated
    with x-ray and γ-ray emission intensities from other radionuclides. Therefore,
    these intensities are ultimately interdependent and correlated to some extent.
    A novel method was applied to determine the photon intensities of α-emitting radionuclides
    by measuring the ratio between the rate of photons in the full energy peaks and
    the rate of detected α-particles with the same detection set-up. Thus, there is
    no need to calibrate the detection efficiency and to standardize calibration sources
    by primary methods. The main condition to reach low uncertainties is to have a
    spectrometer with an intrinsic detection efficiency close to unity for the measured
    photons and α-particles. This condition was fulfilled by a metallic magnetic calorimeter
    (MMC) with an intrinsic efficiency of around 99% between 5 keV and 25 keV. In
    addition, the MMC provides an ultra-high energy resolution of 28 eV (full width
    at half maximum), facilitating the processing of the spectrum. The method was
    applied to determine L x-ray emission intensities from the decay of<sup>241</sup>Am(α)
    →<sup>237</sup>Np emitted between 11.9 keV and 22.4 keV. A total L x-ray emission
    intensity of 37.90 (12) per 100 disintegrations was obtained; the value agrees
    well with previous measurements and has a lower uncertainty. The uncertainties
    of the L x-ray groups Lα, Lηβ and Lγ were improved by a factor of two. Moreover,
    due to the high-energy resolution of 28 eV, a detailed set of 33 L x-ray emission
    intensities are provided.</p>
