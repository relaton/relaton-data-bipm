abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>In order to fulfil its mission to ensure and promote the global
    comparability of measurements, the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures operates
    laboratories in the fields of physical metrology, time, ionizing radiation and
    chemistry. These laboratories act as centers for scientific and technical collaboration
    between Member States providing capabilities for international measurement comparisons
    on a shared cost basis. They coordinate international comparisons of national
    measurement standards agreed to be of the highest priority, and they establish
    and maintain appropriate reference standards for use as the basis of key international
    comparisons at the highest level and provide selected calibrations from them.
    In the following sections, we provide highlights of the work the laboratories
    have undertaken during 2022.</p>
