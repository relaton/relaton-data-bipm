    <title>Abstract</title>
    <p>In order to fulfil its mission to ensure and promote the global comparability of measurements, the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures operates laboratories in the fields of physical metrology, time, ionizing radiation and chemistry. These laboratories act as centers for scientific and technical collaboration between Member States providing capabilities for international measurement comparisons on a shared cost basis. They coordinate international comparisons of national measurement standards agreed to be of the highest priority, and they establish and maintain appropriate reference standards for use as the basis of key international comparisons at the highest level and provide selected calibrations from them. In the following sections, we provide highlights of the work the laboratories have undertaken during 2022.</p>
