abstract:
- content: 'Abstract<p>Multilayer thin-film structures are widely used for many different
    types of devices in the semiconductor, display, and battery manufacturing industries.
    In such devices, the thickness of each layer should be strictly controlled to
    meet desired performance requirements. Various measurement techniques have been
    utilized to take thickness measurements, but verification of these measurements
    continues to rely on simple comparisons. In this study, for an uncertainty evaluation
    of a multilayer thin-film structure, a four-layer multilayer sample (SiO<sub>2</sub>-SiN-SiON-SiO<sub>2</sub>)
    with each layer having a nominal thickness of 100 nm was fabricated together with
    auxiliary single-layer thin-film samples fabricated at the time of each deposition
    step for each layer. The multilayer sample and auxiliary samples (ASs) were measured
    using a calibrated spectral reflectometer, after which their interference spectra
    were analyzed to determine their thicknesses through a model-based analysis. Based
    on the measurement results, the uncertainty of the multilayer sample was evaluated
    by considering two components: the uncertainty of the AS, which included the thickness
    analysis resolution, measurement repeatability, and thickness uniformity; and
    the thickness offset between the four-layer multilayer sample and the ASs. Finally,
    the measurement uncertainties of the thin-film thicknesses in the multilayer sample
    were evaluated and found to be 10.8 nm at the first layer, 9.8 nm at the second
    layer, 7.8 nm at the third layer, and 3.3 nm at the fourth layer.</p>'
