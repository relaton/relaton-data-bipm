    Abstract<p>Several new glass vessels, thermistor probes, and water phantoms have been designed and built at the National Institute of Metrology (China) to upgrade and develop the existing water calorimeter. The increased plane-parallel vessels have shorter thermal stability times and shallower positioning depths (âˆ¼1.3 cm) than the previous cylindrical vessels, which makes them suitable for electron beams. The sensitivity of the new probes is 10% greater than the previous ones. In this study, detailed experimental and theoretical investigations of various factors affecting the new water calorimeter are performed. The system uncertainty of the water calorimeter is reduced and the robustness of the determination of the absorbed-dose-to-water D<sub>w</sub> is improved using a variety of geometric detector vessels and two kinds of high-purity water systems saturated with high-purity gases. This new calorimeter is employed as a primary standard for determining the D<sub>w</sub>, has achieved a combined standard uncertainty of 0.24% for a<sup>60</sup>Co beam, 0.27% for 6 MV and 10 MV photon beams and 0.30% for a 25 MV photon beam. The beam quality conversion factors k<sub>Q</sub>
     of ten cylindrical and three plane-parallel ionization chambers are measured using the new calorimeter to improve the reference dosimetry accuracy of high-energy clinical photon beams.</p>
