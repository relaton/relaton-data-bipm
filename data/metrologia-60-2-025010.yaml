abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>In this work, comparison measurements are presented between
    two independently realised and characterised blackbody cavities which serve as
    irradiance standards, namely the well-established Tilted Bottom Cavity BB2007
    and the new Hemispherical Blackbody (HSBB). Both are used to realise the unit
    for thermal infrared irradiance. The BB2007 at the Physikalisch-Meteorologisches
    Observatorium Davos/World Radiation Center has long provided the reference for
    longwave downward radiation within the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. Longwave
    downward radiation is constantly measured at multiple stations around the world
    using specific broadband infrared radiometers with a hemispherical acceptance
    angle, for example pyrgeometers. The HSBB, developed at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) in recent years, was specifically designed to calibrate radiometers
    with a hemispherical acceptance angle which measure longwave downward radiation.
    The HSBB is directly traceable to the Radiation Temperature Scale of PTB and,
    in turn, via this scale to the SI. Comparison measurements between the BB2007
    and HSBB in this work were carried out with three transfer instruments: the dedicated
    Temperature Stabilised Radiation Thermometer, an Infrared Integrating Sphere (IRIS)
    instrument and a Kipp and Zonen CG4 pyrgeometer. The results show good agreement
    with respect to the target irradiance uncertainty of \n \n 0.5\n \n W m<sup>−2</sup>
    provided by the HSBB. This study thus supports and validates the traceability
    of atmospheric longwave downward radiation to the SI linking measurements performed
    with the World Infrared Standard Group of pyrgeometers to the traceability of
    the reference blackbody BB2007 using IRIS instruments as the transfer standard.</p>"
