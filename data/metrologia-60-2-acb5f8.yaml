abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>A technique for characterizing and correcting the linearity
    of radiometric instruments is known by the names the ‘flux-addition method’ and
    the ‘combinatorial technique’. In this paper, we develop a rigorous uncertainty
    quantification method for use with this technique and illustrate its use with
    both synthetic data and experimental data from a ‘beam conjoiner’ instrument.
    We present a probabilistic model that relates the instrument readout to a set
    of unknown fluxes via a set of polynomial coefficients. Maximum likelihood estimates
    (MLEs) of the unknown fluxes and polynomial coefficients are recommended, while
    a non-parametric bootstrap algorithm enables uncertainty quantification including
    standard errors and confidence intervals.</p><p>The synthetic data represent plausible
    outputs of a radiometric instrument and enable testing and validation of the method.
    The MLEs for these data are found to be approximately unbiased, and confidence
    intervals derived from the bootstrap replicates are found to be consistent with
    their target coverage of 95%. For the polynomial coefficients, the observed coverages
    range from 91% to 99%. The experimental data set illustrates how a complete calibration
    with uncertainties can be achieved using the method plus one well-known flux level.
    The uncertainty contribution attributable to estimation of the instrument’s non-linear
    response is less than 0.025% over most of its range.</p>
