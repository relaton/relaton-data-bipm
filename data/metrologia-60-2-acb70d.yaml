abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>Thin-film thickness and refractive index measurements are important
    for quality control in many high-tech industrial manufacturing processes, such
    as the semiconductor, display, and battery. Many studies have been carried out
    to measure the thickness and refractive index of thin-films, and recently studies
    using an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm have also been conducted. However,
    strict evaluations of ANNs were not reported in all previous studies. In this
    study, a multilayer perceptron type of ANN algorithm for simultaneously analyzing
    the thickness and refractive index of a thin-film is designed and verified by
    using four thin-film certified reference materials (CRMs) being traceable to the
    length standard. According to the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes
    for each hidden layer, 12 multilayer perceptron type ANN algorithms were designed
    and trained with a theoretical dataset generated through optics theory based on
    multiple interferences. Subsequently, the interference spectra measured by the
    four CRMs were put into the 12 trained ANNs as input, and it was checked whether
    or not the output values were in good agreement with the corresponding certified
    values of both the thickness and refractive index. As a result, an ANN algorithm
    having two hidden layers with 100 nodes was selected as the final algorithm and
    an uncertainty evaluation was performed. Finally, the combined uncertainties for
    the thickness and refractive index were estimated to be 2.0 nm and 0.025 at a
    wavelength of 632.8 nm, respectively, as measured using a spectral reflectometer
    with the well-trained ANN algorithm.</p>
