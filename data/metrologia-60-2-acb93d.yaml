abstract:
- content: Abstract<p>The result of a measurement, including the expression of uncertainty
    in the measurement, should represent a carefully considered opinion based on the
    metrologist’s experience and expertise, as well as on the data and other information
    sources. This is the position of the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in
    measurement (GUM), where the requirement for such judgment is clear in the case
    of Type B (non-statistical) evaluation. However, when making Type A evaluations,
    involving statistical analysis of data, the GUM and related GUM documents implicitly
    consider the data to be the only relevant information. This perspective is unfortunate,
    and arguably unscientific, when, as is frequently the case, the metrologist could
    bring other relevant information to bear. Bayesian statistical methods allow the
    use of prior information in addition to the data in Type A evaluation and have
    been advocated by several authors. However, prior information is in principle
    subjective and, as in other fields, there is some resistance in the metrology
    community at large to embrace Bayesian methods using meaningful, subjective prior
    probability distributions. We address our paper to metrologists in measurement
    and calibration laboratories whose workload is such that new techniques will only
    be adopted if they have proven advantages and are straightforward to apply routinely.
    We present two prior distributions for use in the most basic of all Type A evaluations,
    where the data comprise a sample of indications assumed to be normally distributed.
    These distributions represent prior information about the observation error variance
    in a simple form that is readily justified in practice. We show the gains to be
    achieved by using these prior distributions, both in the single Type A evaluation
    and in a more complex measurement model, and present simple guidance for verifying
    their validity.</p>
