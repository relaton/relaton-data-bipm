abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>Performing an x-ray scattering analysis can underpin the quantitative
    description of a sample of interest, for example, to complement an x-ray fluorescence
    analysis. However, the reliability of such an analytical approach depends on good
    knowledge of scattering coefficients (or scattering cross-sections), which describe
    the probability of interaction and are characteristic of each chemical element.
    In this work, a metrological study of experimentally determining differential
    Rayleigh and Compton scattering coefficients for nickel is presented. Angular
    scans of the scattering intensities at different positions are enabled by a flexible
    experimental set-up and, therefore, allow for the robust determination of differential
    scattering coefficients at a wide range of forward and backward scattering angles.
    As a result, scattering coefficients in the range from \n \n 0.117(14)×10−3\n
    \n  cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> to \n \n 33.7(39)×10−3\n \n
     cm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup> were determined in the momentum
    transfer range of 12.1 nm<sup>−1</sup> to 22.4 nm<sup>−1</sup>. In addition, utilizing
    monochromatized and highly linearly polarized synchrotron radiation (\n \n E0=30keV\n
    \n ) ensures direct comparability to theoretical databases.</p>"
