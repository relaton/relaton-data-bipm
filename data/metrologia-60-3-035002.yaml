abstract:
- content: "Abstract<p>We present the new absolute frequency measurement of ytterbium
    (<sup>171</sup>Yb) obtained at INRiM with the optical lattice clock IT-Yb1 against
    the cryogenic caesium (<sup>133</sup>Cs) fountain IT-CsF2, evaluated through a
    measurement campaign that lasted 14 months. Measurements are performed by either
    using a hydrogen maser as a transfer oscillator or by synthesizing a low-noise
    microwave for Cs interrogation using an optical frequency comb. The frequency
    of the<sup>171</sup>Yb unperturbed clock transition \n \n 1\n \n S\n \n 0→3\n
    \n P<sub>0</sub> results to be 518 295 836 590 863.44(14) Hz, with a total fractional
    uncertainty of \n \n 2.7×10−16\n \n that is limited by the uncertainty of IT-CsF2.
    Our measurement is in agreement with the Yb frequency recommended by the Consultative
    Committee for Time and Frequency. This result confirms the reliability of Yb as
    a secondary representation of the second and is relevant to the process of redefining
    the second in the International System of Units on an optical transition.</p>"
