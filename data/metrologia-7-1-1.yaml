abstract:
- content: "<p>Various absolute steady-state methods of measuring thermal conductivity
    can be made to yield, verifiably, experimental results accurate to within ± 2%
    from 100 to 1200 K, and for conductivity values from 0.1 to 5 W/cmK. This statement
    is substantiated by a detailed analysis of the results obtained by eight different
    systems in three laboratories on ten metals: Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Pt, W, Cr, Armco
    Iron, and the alloys Nb-10 W and Inconel 702. The experimental systems by which
    these results were obtained are also briefly described.</p><p>The achievement
    of such accuracy, however, requires that careful attention be paid to the design
    and operation of the experimental apparatus. In general, the thermal conductivity
    is computed from three parameters: the power developed in a specific heater; the
    temperature difference due to that heater; and a geometrical factor relating the
    two through the geometry of the heat flow pattern. The determination of each parameter
    presents problems of its own; these we outline, and present solutions to them
    which are often a matter of judicious compromises. However, because the individual
    problems are not equally severe for the different methods here discussed, the
    close agreement of the results that we show provides a gratifying reassurance
    that the experimental approaches and theoretical analysis, including estimates
    of error, are basically sound.</p>"
