abstract:
- content: "<p>The Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ has been evaluated by using an absolute
    radiometer of the electrical substitution type to measure the radiance of a cavity
    radiator at the freezing-point of gold, T<sub>Au</sub>. The value obtained for
    σ, based on the IPTS-68 value of 1337.58 ± 0.20 K for T<sub>Au</sub>, is (5.6644
    ± 0.0075) × 10<sup>-8</sup> W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-4</sup>. Unlike most earlier
    experimental values, this result is not inconsistent with the theoretical value
    of (5.6696 ± 0.0025) × 10<sup>-8</sup> W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-4</sup> calculated
    from the present best values of c, h, and k. Alternatively, the experiment may
    be regarded as a radiometric determination of the gold-point based on the theoretical
    value for σ, the result then being T<sub>Au</sub> = 1337.27 ± 0.40 K. This value
    is 0.31 K below the IPTS-68 value, derived by gas thermometry.</p>"
