  content: "<p>The Stefan-Boltzmann constant σ has been evaluated by using an absolute
    radiometer of the electrical substitution type to measure the radiance of a cavity
    radiator at the freezing-point of gold, <italic>T</italic><sub>Au</sub>. The value
    obtained for σ, based on the IPTS-68 value of 1337.58 ± 0.20 K for <italic>T</italic><sub>Au</sub>,
    is (5.6644 ± 0.0075) × 10<sup>-8</sup> W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-4</sup>. Unlike
    most earlier experimental values, this result is not inconsistent with the theoretical
    value of (5.6696 ± 0.0025) × 10<sup>-8</sup> W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-4</sup> calculated
    from the present best values of <italic>c, h</italic>, and <italic>k</italic>.
    Alternatively, the experiment may be regarded as a radiometric determination of
    the gold-point based on the theoretical value for σ, the result then being <italic>T</italic><sub>Au</sub>
    = 1337.27 ± 0.40 K. This value is 0.31 K below the IPTS-68 value, derived by gas
    thermometry.</p>"
