  content: "<p>The problem of measuring a number of length etalons in terms of one
    well-known reference etalon may be solved by various intercomparison schemes.
    The optimal scheme will provide equal prescribed precision for all derived values
    with a minimal number of measurements. Criteria are established and comparison
    schemes developed which provide the optimal results.</p>"
