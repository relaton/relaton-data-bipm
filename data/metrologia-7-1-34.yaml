abstract:
- content: "<p>A calculation of the thermal neutron self-absorption for cylindrical
    or spherical neutron sources has been made. The calculations are confirmed by
    the experimentally-measured difference in manganous sulfate bath activity for
    bare and cadmium-covered Pu-Be and Am-Be neutron sources. The calculation is done
    in single interaction approximation and assumes that the incident thermal neutron
    flux is isotropic. The source material may be fissionable and be covered by up
    to three cladding materials. A computer program has been written for the numerical
    calculations.</p>"
