abstract:
- content: "<p>The suitability of vacuum tungsten blackbody lamps as secondary standard
    sources in photoelectric pyrometry has been investigated. It has been found that
    although the sources are stable when operated for long periods at temperatures
    up to 1625 °C they will not maintain calibration when physical strain is introduced
    into the tungsten tube or supports, for example, by vibration of the lamp. All
    changes detected in calibration of lamps have been accompanied by changes in their
    electrical resistances, and therefore this parameter can be used as a monitor
    of calibration stability. Variations in resistance at the gold point of 0.1% produce
    significant changes in calibration. The effect of pin temperature on the lamp
    resistance and spectral radiance temperature are given. When precautions are taken
    in handling, mounting and storage to minimise the introduction of strain in the
    lamps the uncertainty in their calibration at the gold point is less than ±0.1°C.</p>"
