  content: "<p>The frequency shift in cesium beam atomic frequency standards resulting
    from the second order doppler shift is described in terms of a truncated Maxwellian
    velocity distribution in the atomic beam. A means of establishing the upper and
    lower limits of the atomic velocities accepted by the standard, based on fitting
    of experimental and calculated Ramsey resonance patterns, is outlined. A detailed
    analysis of the influence of both the velocity distribution and the exciting power
    level is given, and it is shown that an asymmetric resonance results, with asymmetry
    greatest for a full Maxwellian distribution. Results are given for the NRC 2.1
    m cesium standard, Cs III. An increase of the second order doppler shift correction
    for Cs III from 0.003 Hz to 0.0072 Hz is required, and the effect of this on the
    NRC UTA time scale is discussed.</p>"
