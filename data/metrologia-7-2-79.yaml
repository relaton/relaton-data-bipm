  content: "<p>The paper cited in the title by Winkler, Hall, and Percival (WHP) documents
    some important aspects of the widely referenced United States Naval Observatory
    (USNO) Time Scale system. We augment the text of WHP regarding the mutual synchronization
    to within 5 Î¼s of the Time Scale, UTC(USNO), with another widely referenced time
    scale, the National Bureau of Standard UTC(NBS) Time Scale. We show that some
    of the information available to WHP can be utilized to give even more precision
    to the USNO Time Scale system and that some of that information has been improperly
    interpreted causing some errors by WHP in their conclusions regarding time scale
    precision, clock weighting factors, and drift in rate of the time scale.</p>"
