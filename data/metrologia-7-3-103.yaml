abstract:
- content: "<p>An ion storage exchange collision experiment on heavy paramagnetic
    ions is proposed to study the possibility of using a hyperfine structure transition
    of Hg<sup>+</sup> as the basis of a new primary frequency standard. All known
    limitations of the accuracy, with the exception of the second order Doppler effect
    and of the rms frequency stability, are expected to be smaller than 10<sup>-14</sup>.
    Methods are discussed to reduce the second order Doppler effect and to increase
    the rms frequency stability by cooling the ions and by stabilizing their temperature.</p>"
