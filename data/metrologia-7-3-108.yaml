abstract:
- content: <p>To obtain some of the information necessary for redefining a practical
    temperature scale in terms of resistance thermometry up to the gold point, we
    have intercompared nine high temperature platinum resistance thermometers and
    eight standard thermocouples at 50 degree intervals over the range 630.74 to 1064.43
    °C. Values of temperature were derived from "before and after" calibrations of
    the instruments at the freezing points of gold, silver, antimony, zinc, and tin,
    and at the triple point of water. – Analysis of the data showed that the standard
    deviation of temperatures measured with thermometers was about 4 mK, while with
    thermocouples it ranged from 25 to 30 mK. When systematic errors were accounted
    for, we found that values of temperature on IPTS-68 could be determined with a
    single thermometer, using an interpolation formula analogous to that used below
    630.74 °C, with about one-third the uncertainty usually attributed to a single
    thermocouple determination (±200 mK). The data also revealed that there is a lack
    of "smoothness" in the scale at 630.74 °C – first derivatives with respect to
    t<sub>68</sub> are discontinuous by about 0.1% at this temperature. – We conclude
    from the results of this work that if a practical temperature scale were redefined
    in terms of presently available high temperature platinum resistance thermometers,
    it could be realized with significantly less uncertainty (±12 mK for a single
    determination) than IPTS-68, as it is now realized with thermocouples (±200 mK
    for a single determination). We recommend, however, that the adoption of such
    a scale be deferred until indicated improvements in thermometers have been made,
    and until current researches in gas thermometry have provided new values of thermodynamic
    temperatures for calibrating fixed points.</p>
