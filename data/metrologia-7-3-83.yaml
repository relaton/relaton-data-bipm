abstract:
- content: "<p>In an article published in 1967 in this journal, an initial theoretical
    formula has been proposed to represent the variation of the water density as a
    function of the variations of its isotopic composition. Following this article,
    an experimental programme has been undertaken with the purpose of checking the
    validity of the formula. Limited at first to a density interval of 2·10<sup>-3</sup>
    kg·m<sup>-3</sup>, this study was then enlarged to a ten times greater interval.
    As a consequence, the formula has been revised, so that it is more suitable for
    this new interval of density.</p><p>Experimental observations have been made on
    the density and the isotopic composition of various water samples. The variations
    of density have been determined by observing the buoyant force exerted by each
    sample of water on a stainless steel cylinder. The isotopic composition has been
    determined by mass spectrometry.</p><p>The law of variation of the water density
    as a function of its isotopic composition, deduced from our observations, is slightly
    different from that obtained by the theoretical formula.</p>"
