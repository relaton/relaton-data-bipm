abstract:
- content: "<p>Calculations of the signal, depth of modulation, and signal-to-noise
    ratio of a scanning photoelectric microscope are made for a variety of line profiles.
    The effects of non-uniform irradiance in the image of the slit (due, for example,
    to diffraction) are examined. Spectral analyses of actual line profiles are presented,
    and the choice of electrical bandwidth to pass the signals is discussed. The effects
    of line width on the linearity and sensitivity of the output are examined theoretically
    and experimentally. It is shown that a direct-reading photoelectric microscope
    can have adequate linearity and reproducibility of calibration for precise settings
    on a wide variety of lines.</p>"
