  content: "<p>A method is described for the intercomparison of the activities of
    radium sources, using a lithium-drifted germanium detector for relative measurements
    of the photopeak intensity corresponding to a given Î³-ray. Some typical results
    are presented and experimental uncertainties are discussed.</p>"
