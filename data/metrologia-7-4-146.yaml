abstract:
- content: "<p>Techniques of construction of atomic time scales are discussed and
    experiments at the National Research Council using a group of commercial cesium
    standards and the NRC 2.1 m laboratory cesium standard, Cs III, are described.
    Time scales based on the multiple standard approach are compared with the scale
    UTA (NRC) resulting from the periodic calibration of a secondary standard in terms
    of Cs III. The influence of the frequency stability of the secondary standard
    on the accuracy and the uniformity of the latter time scale is discussed in detail
    and it appears that non-uniformities of UTA (NRC) are dependent in large part
    on instabilities in the secondary standard. A comparison between the monthly rate
    fluctuations of UTA (NRC) and UTC (USNO), measured with respect to UTC (BIH),
    shows that UTC (USNO), which exemplifies one of the most sophisticated realizations
    of the multiple standard technique, is about twice as uniform as UTA (NRC). A
    proposal aimed at minimizing the growing complexity and expense of atomic time
    scale operation is made, involving the continuous use of a long beam primary cesium
    standard to generate a time scale possibly more accurate and uniform than existing
    scales.</p>"
