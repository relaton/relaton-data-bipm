  content: "<p>One of the limiting factors which restrict the hydrogen maser to the
    role of a secondary frequency standard is the uncertainty in the experimental
    determination of the wall shift. This paper describes a series of experiments
    carried out at the National Research Council of Canada, using two hydrogen masers,
    to investigate the wall shift of five spherical storage bulbs of different diameters,
    each coated by the same technique with FEP Teflon from the same batch. The theoretically
    predicted inverse relationship between wall shift and bulb diameter was found
    to hold experimentally with very small point scatter for all five bulbs. Results
    showing the dependence of wall shift on bulb diameter and the variation of wall
    shift with temperature from 23°C to 35°C are given. Measurements made on the largest
    storage bulb at the beginning and end of the series of experiments allow some
    estimate to be made of the stability of the wall shift over a period of several
    months. Measurements indicating a change in wall shift of not more than 2 parts
    in 10<sup>13</sup> over a period of 7 months for a storage bulb transported between
    Japan and Canada are also discussed. Comparison of the frequency of one of the
    masers with that of the NRC primary cesium beam frequency standard (Cs III) has
    given a value of the unperturbed hydrogen hyperfine transition frequency of 1420405751.770
    ± 0.003 Hz, which is in satisfactory agreement with the most recent determinations
    by other workers.</p>"
