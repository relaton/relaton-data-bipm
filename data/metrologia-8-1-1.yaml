  content: <p>Oxygen vapor pressure measurements reported in the literature have been
    critically evaluated and the most consistent and reliable of the data sets have
    been correlated with a vapor pressure equation. However, the data were first adjusted
    for temperature scale differences to conform with the IPTS-68 temperature scale.
    "Best" values for the oxygen triple point and critical point parameters were selected
    for use as indirect constraints in the equation. Pressures obtained from this
    equation are compared to corresponding values calculated from other published
    oxygen vapor pressure equations. A new value for the critical pressure of oxygen
    of 5.043<sub>2</sub> MN/m<sup>2</sup> (49.77<sub>2</sub> atm) is given.</p>
