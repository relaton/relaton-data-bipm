abstract:
- content: "<p>Apparatus design and procedures are described for the determination
    of the vapor pressures of naturally occurring neon (<sup>nat</sup>Ne) and the
    pure isotopes<sup>20</sup>Ne and<sup>22</sup>Ne from their triple points (TP)
    to their normal boiling points (NBP). The data have been fitted to vapor-pressure
    equations with root-mean-square deviations of ± 2.5 to ± 4.7 N/m<sup>2</sup> (±
    0.019 to ± 0.035 mmHg). The TP pressures (P) and the TP and NBP temperatures (T)
    were found to be:</p><p>\n \n\n\nTP\nNBP\n\n\n\n\n P\n \n\n T, K\n\n T, K<sup>nat</sup>Ne\n43332
    ± 13 N/m<sup>2</sup> (325.02 ± 0.10 mmHg)\n24.553 ± 0.001\n27.096 ±0.001<sup>20</sup>Ne\n43326
    ± 13 N/m<sup>2</sup> (324.97 ± 0.10 mmHg)\n24.540 ± 0.001\n27.084 ± 0.001<sup>22</sup>Ne\n43654
    ± 13 N/m<sup>2</sup> (327.43 ± 0.10 mmHg\n24.687 ± 0.001\n27.211 ± 0.001</p><p>(The
    temperatures are in terms of the NBS-1955 provisional temperature scale. The figures
    after the ± symbol indicate estimated uncertainties). The calculated vapor pressures
    of the isotopic<sup>nat</sup>Ne, based on Raoult's law of solution and the observed
    vapor pressures of the pure isotopes, are in agreement within the combined precision
    of the measurements with the observed values of<sup>nat</sup>Ne.</p>"
