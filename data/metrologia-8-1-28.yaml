  content: "<p>The influence of the atomic velocity distribution in cesium beam atomic
    frequency standards on the frequency shift due to Ramsey cavity phase difference
    is discussed. The atomic resonance is shifted and its shape distorted to a degree
    dependent not only on the exciting power level and cavity phase difference, but
    also on the actual velocity distribution which exists in the standard. Calculations
    carried out for the NRC 2.1 metre primary standard show that, for the velocity
    distribution which probably exists in this standard, the resonance distortion
    gives rise to a power dependence of the frequency shift of about an order of magnitude
    less than that expected for a Maxwellian velocity distribution in the beam. Experimental
    measurements tend to support this result.</p>"
