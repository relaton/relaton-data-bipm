abstract:
- content: "<p>A description is presented of the establishment of the IPTS68 from
    1064.43 °C to 2200 °C on vacuum and gas-filled tungsten blackbody lamps using
    the NSL photoelectric pyrometer. The apparatus, experimental technique and computational
    methods, including a method for calculating the effective emissivity of the walls
    of blackbody cavity radiators, are described and the components of all significant
    uncertainties are stated. The total uncertainties (99% confidence limits) obtained
    are ±0.10 °C at 1064.43 °C and ±0.25 °C at 1627 °C for vacuum lamps, and ±0.4
    °C at 1627 °C and ±1.6 °C at 2200 °C for the gas-filled lamp.</p>"
