abstract:
- content: "<p>A comparison among three precise timing centers in the United States
    has been conducted for more than 1 year using three different synchronization
    methods. The timing centers involved were the United States Naval Observatory
    (USNO) in Washington, DC, Newark Air Force Station (NAFS) in Newark, Ohio, and
    the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Boulder, Colorado. The three methods
    were cesium beam portable clocks; Loran-C transmissions from Cape Fear, North
    Carolina, and Dana, Indiana; and ABC, CBS, and NBC network television broadcasts
    commonly received by the three timing centers.</p><p>Cesium beam portable clocks
    have the capability of accurately and precisely synchronizing remote clocks to
    within 0.1 μs. The Loran-C data involved a 3500 km (2180 miles) ground wave path
    – the longest Loran-C ground wave path that has been studied with the precision
    and accuracy reported herein. The long-term precision achieved was about 1 μs
    over 1 year. The accuracy is limited on occasion by inability to resolve the 10
    μs ambiguity of the 100-kHz pulse train. The precision capability of maintaining
    remote clock synchronization within the majority of the continental United States
    using network television broadcasts was inferred to be about 5 ns·τ<sup>1/3</sup>
    s<sup>-1/3</sup> over the range of τ from 86 400 s (1 day) to about 10<sup>7</sup>
    s (324 days) but with definite accuracy limitations caused by such factors as
    occasional network re-routing of the television signals. Some estimates of the
    long-term frequency stabilities among the references used at the three timing
    centers were measured or inferred.</p>"
