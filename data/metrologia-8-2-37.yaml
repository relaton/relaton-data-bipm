  content: "<p>A comparison of 1/1 ratio and 10/1 ratio current transformer calibrations
    at frequencies of 1, 5 and 10 kilohertz obtained by measurement techniques developed
    independently by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt of West Germany and
    the National Research Council of Canada is presented. Discrepancies between the
    two laboratories of 0.03, 0.09 and 0.28 parts per million at 1, 5 and 10 kilohertz
    respectively are indicated. Uncertainties in the measurements which may account
    for these discrepancies are discussed.</p>"
