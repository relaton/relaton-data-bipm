    <p>During intercomparison of standard free air chambers at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures small but systematic differences were found between two types of chambers, having substantially different internal beam path lengths.</p>
    <p>An experiment was performed to investigate which influence these differences could have upon the correction factor <italic>K</italic><sub>sc</sub> to be applied for the radiation scattered inside these chambers.</p>
