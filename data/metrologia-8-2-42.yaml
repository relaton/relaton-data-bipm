abstract:
- content: "<p>During intercomparison of standard free air chambers at the Bureau
    International des Poids et Mesures small but systematic differences were found
    between two types of chambers, having substantially different internal beam path
    lengths.</p><p>An experiment was performed to investigate which influence these
    differences could have upon the correction factor K<sub>sc</sub> to be applied
    for the radiation scattered inside these chambers.</p>"
