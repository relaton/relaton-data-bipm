  content: "<p>A paramagnetic salt temperature scale <italic>T</italic><sub>x</sub>
    has been established for temperatures between 1 and 18 K which is based on the
    extrapolation of the NBS-1955 platinum resistance thermometer scale (<italic>T</italic><sub>55</sub>)
    from 18 to 34 K for two salts, chromic methylammonium alum and manganous ammonium
    sulfate. This scale is retained in terms of the calibrations of germanium resistance
    thermometers. Deviations from this scale are given for the liquid helium vapor
    pressure scales (<italic>T</italic><sub>VP</sub>), the NBS-Acoustic scale 2 -
    20 K (<italic>T</italic><sub>AC</sub>) and <italic>T</italic><sub>55</sub>. The
    resulting precision (0.01%, 0.3 ⩽ Δ<italic>T</italic> ⩽ 1 mK) is much greater
    than the thermodynamic accuracy because of ambiguities in the realization of the
    thermodynamic scale in the calibration region. Internal inconsistencies were observed
    for <italic>T</italic><sub>55</sub> below 18 K and for IPTS-68 (<italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub>)
    above 27 K. The data also were used to investigate the smoothness of the Acoustic
    scale from 2.3 to 19 K. The scale which results from a smoothing of an Acoustic
    calibration with the susceptibility data lies intermediate between those generated
    from <italic>T</italic><sub>55</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub>, and
    suggests that the correct value of the boiling point of hydrogen lies 1 = 1 mK
    below that value assumed for IPTS-68. On this basis, the accepted boiling point
    of helium is 8.5 ± 1.5 mK too low, while it is 6.7 ± 0.5 mK too low for the <italic>T</italic><sub>55</sub>-based
    scale, and 10 ± 0.5 mK too low for that based on <italic>T</italic><sub>68</sub>.</p>"
