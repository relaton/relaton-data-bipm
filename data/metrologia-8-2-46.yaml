abstract:
- content: "<p>A paramagnetic salt temperature scale T<sub>x</sub> has been established
    for temperatures between 1 and 18 K which is based on the extrapolation of the
    NBS-1955 platinum resistance thermometer scale (T<sub>55</sub>) from 18 to 34
    K for two salts, chromic methylammonium alum and manganous ammonium sulfate. This
    scale is retained in terms of the calibrations of germanium resistance thermometers.
    Deviations from this scale are given for the liquid helium vapor pressure scales
    (T<sub>VP</sub>), the NBS-Acoustic scale 2 - 20 K (T<sub>AC</sub>) and T<sub>55</sub>.
    The resulting precision (0.01%, 0.3 ⩽ ΔT ⩽ 1 mK) is much greater than the thermodynamic
    accuracy because of ambiguities in the realization of the thermodynamic scale
    in the calibration region. Internal inconsistencies were observed for T<sub>55</sub>
    below 18 K and for IPTS-68 (T<sub>68</sub>) above 27 K. The data also were used
    to investigate the smoothness of the Acoustic scale from 2.3 to 19 K. The scale
    which results from a smoothing of an Acoustic calibration with the susceptibility
    data lies intermediate between those generated from T<sub>55</sub> and T<sub>68</sub>,
    and suggests that the correct value of the boiling point of hydrogen lies 1 =
    1 mK below that value assumed for IPTS-68. On this basis, the accepted boiling
    point of helium is 8.5 ± 1.5 mK too low, while it is 6.7 ± 0.5 mK too low for
    the T<sub>55</sub>-based scale, and 10 ± 0.5 mK too low for that based on T<sub>68</sub>.</p>"
