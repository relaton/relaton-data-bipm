  content: "<p>A fringe counting device has been designed and fitted into the photoelectric
    interferential comparator of the BIPM for length measurements up to 1 m; it makes
    use of a monomode He-Ne laser, stabilised on the Lamb-dip (λ = 633 nm). Our main
    concern was to get from fringe counting the greatest reliability and the highest
    precision possible. Optics, electronics and measurement procedures which were
    developed are described. The precision remains around ten nanometres; no false
    counting occurred during severe testing, not during more than 1 year of controlled
    operation. Measurement of a line standard or a block gauge can be carried out,
    almost simultaneously, in the ordinary way (using the Michelson interferometer
    with flat mirrors and the standard wavelength of an 86 krypton lamp) and by laser
    fringe counting. Discrepancies between the two methods generally remain within
    20 nanometres when measuring 1 m bars or gauges. Fringe counting is especially
    valuable for measuring line standards and block gauges over 0.5 m long and for
    determining the intervals of line scales. In this case, it works about one hundred
    times faster than the usual method and with the same precision. Combined use of
    both methods allows the direct linking of the measurements to the krypton standard
    wavelength and the monitoring of the slow drifts of the laser wavelength.</p>"
