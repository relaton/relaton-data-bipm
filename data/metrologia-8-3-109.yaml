  content: "<p>The least squares solution of a set of overdetermined equations obtained
    from pair comparison measurements among selected members of a group of units is
    derived, subject to a given constraint imposed on the solution. The method of
    applying constraints is discussed. Applications to the assessment of random errors
    in the maintenance and scaling of the unit of resistance are described. The method
    has been programmed for a computer which allows the use of the analysis for many
    different experimental schemes.</p>"
