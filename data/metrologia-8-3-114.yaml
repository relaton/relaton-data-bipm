abstract:
- content: "<p>The techniques used for the monitoring of the NSL standard of emf using
    the ac Josephson effect are reported. The standard has been monitored since 29th
    May 1970 and the reported measurements span a period of 482 days. These measurements
    have predominantly used niobium point contact Josephson junctions operated at
    the 1 mV level.</p><p>The mean of the set of standard cells comprising the NSL
    standard has been determined in terms of a `Josephson frequency'. The value of
    this frequency at the time of the NBS-NSL volt transfer was 492.590 64 THz and
    a value of 2 e/h = 483.593 80 Â± 0.1 ppm THz/V<sub>NSL</sub> has been obtained
    for this period.</p>"
