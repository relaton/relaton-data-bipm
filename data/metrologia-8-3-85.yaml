abstract:
- content: "<p>A new kind of atomic beam absolute frequency standard is proposed.
    The fine structure<sup>3</sup>P<sub>0</sub>, m<sub>f</sub> = 0 â†”<sup>3</sup>P<sub>1</sub>,
    m<sub>f</sub> = 0 line of the Mg or Ca metastable triplet state is used as reference
    transition. The basic design features and the limiting factors are analyzed. The
    frequency stability is mainly limited by the second order Doppler effect and the
    estimated accuracy capability is better than 10<sup>-15</sup>, near the theoretical
    limit of a passive atomic beam device.</p>"
