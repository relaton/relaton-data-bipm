abstract:
- content: "<p>A hot cathode<sup>114</sup>Cd, as well as a watercooled hot cathode<sup>198</sup>Hg
    lamp were recently designed. The line profiles of the visible radiations produced
    by use of these were investigated and the wavelengths measured. The result is
    that under certain conditions of operation the new light sources fulfill very
    well the requirements stated in the international recommendation of secondary<sup>114</sup>Cd
    and<sup>198</sup>Hg wavelength standards. The wavelengths obtained agree with
    the adopted values within the allowable tolerances. In comparison with the electrodeless,
    high frequency excited lamp specified in the international recommendation, the
    hot cathode lamps have the advantage that the operation of these is more convenient
    and that the operating conditions are extremely easy to control. Consequently
    the wavelengths of the hot cathode type lamp are more reliable and more accurate.
    In particular, the hot cathode<sup>114</sup>Cd lamp is very well suited to interferential
    length measurements up to and even exceeding 100 mm lengths by use of the method
    of exact fractional orders.</p>"
