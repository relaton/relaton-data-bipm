  content: "<p>A hot cathode <sup>114</sup>Cd, as well as a watercooled hot cathode
    <sup>198</sup>Hg lamp were recently designed. The line profiles of the visible
    radiations produced by use of these were investigated and the wavelengths measured.
    The result is that under certain conditions of operation the new light sources
    fulfill very well the requirements stated in the international recommendation
    of secondary <sup>114</sup>Cd and <sup>198</sup>Hg wavelength standards. The wavelengths
    obtained agree with the adopted values within the allowable tolerances. In comparison
    with the electrodeless, high frequency excited lamp specified in the international
    recommendation, the hot cathode lamps have the advantage that the operation of
    these is more convenient and that the operating conditions are extremely easy
    to control. Consequently the wavelengths of the hot cathode type lamp are more
    reliable and more accurate. In particular, the hot cathode <sup>114</sup>Cd lamp
    is very well suited to interferential length measurements up to and even exceeding
    100 mm lengths by use of the method of exact fractional orders.</p>"
