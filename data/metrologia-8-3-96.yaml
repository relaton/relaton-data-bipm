abstract:
- content: "<p>A frequency standard is described in which a quartz crystal oscillator
    is locked to the hydrogen hyperfine transition using the dispersion of this resonance.
    The hydrogen storage beam apparatus closely resembles a hydrogen maser with a
    low-Q cavity below oscillation threshold. Cavity pulling can be reduced to a point
    where environmental temperature fluctuations limit the stability mainly via the
    second-order Doppler effect. Locking to the dispersion feature of the resonance
    eliminates the need for frequency modulation in order to find line-center. The
    stability of the frequency standard was measured against crystal oscillators and
    cesium beam frequency standards; stabilities of 4 Ã— 10<sup>-13</sup> were recorded
    for sampling times of 30 seconds and of 3 hours.</p>"
