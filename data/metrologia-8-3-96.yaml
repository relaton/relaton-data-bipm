  content: "<p>A frequency standard is described in which a quartz crystal oscillator
    is locked to the hydrogen hyperfine transition using the dispersion of this resonance.
    The hydrogen storage beam apparatus closely resembles a hydrogen maser with a
    low-<italic>Q</italic> cavity below oscillation threshold. Cavity pulling can
    be reduced to a point where environmental temperature fluctuations limit the stability
    mainly via the second-order Doppler effect. Locking to the dispersion feature
    of the resonance eliminates the need for frequency modulation in order to find
    line-center. The stability of the frequency standard was measured against crystal
    oscillators and cesium beam frequency standards; stabilities of 4 Ã— 10<sup>-13</sup>
    were recorded for sampling times of 30 seconds and of 3 hours.</p>"
