abstract:
- content: "<p>The lastest NPL determinations of 2 e/h  using the ac Josephson effect
    are reported, with emphasis on the improvements made over earlier measurements.
    The precision of the experiment is such that it should be regarded as a means
    of monitoring the national maintained voltage standard. The value of 2 e/h  obtained
    most recently, in April 1972, is 483,594.00 (Â±0.10) GHz/V<sub>NPL</sub>.</p>"
