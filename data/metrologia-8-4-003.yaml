abstract:
- content: "<p>Omission from Planck's formula of terms for the refractive index of
    the medium has led (a) to errors in optical pyrometry, e.g., of 0.3 K at the freezing
    point of platinum, and (b) to errors of about 0.5% in values calculated for K<sub>m</sub>
    and á¸°<sub>m</sub>, the maximum spectral luminous efficacies of radiation.</p>"
