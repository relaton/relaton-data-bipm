  content: "<p>The lastest NPL determinations of 2<italic>e/h</italic> using the ac
    Josephson effect are reported, with emphasis on the improvements made over earlier
    measurements. The precision of the experiment is such that it should be regarded
    as a means of monitoring the national maintained voltage standard. The value of
    2<italic>e/h</italic> obtained most recently, in April 1972, is 483,594.00 (Â±0.10)
    GHz/V<sub>NPL</sub>.</p>"
