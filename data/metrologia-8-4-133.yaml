abstract:
- content: "<p>A photometric system has been developed for measuring the absolute
    values of spectral irradiance from a fluorescent lamp. In the improved method,
    radiant fluxes of the fluorescent and standard lamps to be compared enter a double
    monochromator alternately through a rotating integrating sphere.</p><p>The intermittent
    rotation of the sphere and the recording of the outputs from a receptor located
    at the exit slit of the monochromator are made automatically. Our laboratory participated
    in the CIE international intercomparison of spectroradiometric measurements and
    our results were obtained using the method described.</p>"
