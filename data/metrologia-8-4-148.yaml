  content: "<p>Three configurations of ring capacitors with four electrodes have been
    investigated. In cross-section the electrodes have straight or circular sides
    or combinations of both. Displacements of all electrodes have a second order effect
    on the weighted mean value of the diagonal cross-capacitance. These configurations
    are therefore suitable for a secondary standard of capacitance. The value of capacitance
    can be computed from the dimensions to a very high accuracy with an available
    program. For consideration as an absolute standard, accuracy of diameter measurement
    and curvature of the electrodes are the determining factors.</p>"
