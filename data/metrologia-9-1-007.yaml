abstract:
- content: "<p>Dew, boiling, and triple points have been realized for home-made and
    for commercial varieties of oxygen. Of the samples tested the home-made variety
    was found to be of higher purity than the commercial ones. The experimental results
    have also indicated that the dew points are much more reproducible than the boiling
    points for home-made samples, and that the boiling range, i.e. the difference
    between the dew and the boiling points, is just as useful a purity indicator as
    the melting range except when argon is an impurity. The results obtained using
    home-made samples for the dew points were within a spread of 0.30 mK. The boiling
    and the melting ranges were less than 0.55 and 0.70 mK respectively. For good
    quality commercial samples on the other hand a larger spread of values was found.
    All experiments were performed adiabatically in order to minimize systematic errors.
    – Known amounts of impurities were introduced into the oxygen to explore their
    influence on the above fixed points. It was found that some non-volatile impurities
    increased the dew and boiling points whereas others left them unaltered. On the
    other hand, all volatile impurities tested decreased them. The change of the triple
    points is known not to be this clear-cut. – Comments are made concerning the differences
    between adiabatic boiling and freezing point cryostats from the point of view
    of the experimenter. The quoting of statistical errors in fixed point realizations
    may be irrelevant unless they relate to results obtained under adiabatic experimental
    conditions. Similarly, apparently good agreement between the results of different
    experiments can be fortuitous unless, again, they relate to adiabatic experiments.</p>"
