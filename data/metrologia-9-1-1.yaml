abstract:
- content: "<p>Metrological aspects of the IPTS reproduction in the UHF range for
    the high and superhigh temperature region as well as the verification scheme are
    discussed. The latter is designed for graduating radiopyrometers and their antenna
    systems. A high temperature radiator which can form the basis for a high temperature
    UHF noise standard with a wide aperture is described. The source random error
    of the IPTS reproduction δ<sub>rand</sub> = 0.21 dB and the unaccountable part
    of the systematic error δ<sub>syst</sub> = 0.21 dB. The certification random error
    with this scheme is δ<sub>cert</sub> = 6%. Methods are discussed for graduating
    radiopyrometers and their antenna systems against the radiator developed with
    the error of 6 to 10%.</p>"
