  content: "<p>The correlation counting method is extended to two-step cascade processes
    with relatively long-lived intermediate states. Expressions are given for the
    statistical uncertainties and deadtime effects. The technique is applied to the
    absolute standardisation of <sup>75</sup>Se, <sup>67</sup>Ga, <sup>67</sup>Cu
    and <sup>85</sup>Sr activities, and to the detection and estimation of afterpulses
    in liquid scintillation counting.</p>"
