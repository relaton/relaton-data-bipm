abstract:
- content: "<p>The correlation counting method is extended to two-step cascade processes
    with relatively long-lived intermediate states. Expressions are given for the
    statistical uncertainties and deadtime effects. The technique is applied to the
    absolute standardisation of<sup>75</sup>Se,<sup>67</sup>Ga,<sup>67</sup>Cu and<sup>85</sup>Sr
    activities, and to the detection and estimation of afterpulses in liquid scintillation
    counting.</p>"
