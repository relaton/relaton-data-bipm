abstract:
- content: "<p>It is shown how an improved measurement of the absolute ampere, that
    is, the ratio of a particular as-maintained unit of current to the absolute or
    Système International d'Unités (SI) unit of current, can now lead to an improved
    value of the Avogadro constant.</p>"
