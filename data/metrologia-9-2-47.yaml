  content: "<p>An absolute determination of the acceleration due to gravity has been
    completed at the Australian National Standards Laboratory. The experiment was
    of the free rise-and-fall type using a corner-reflector as the moving body. The
    value of <italic>g</italic> obtained was 9.796 720 m s<sup>-2</sup>, which is
    138 μm s<sup>-2</sup> below the value assigned to the site on the old Potsdam
    system. The estimated uncertainty of the result is ± 2 μm s<sup>-2</sup>(± 2 parts
    in 10<sup>7</sup>).</p>"
