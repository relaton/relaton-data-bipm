    <p>Attention is drawn on the fact that several tables of the thermal expansion of water are available between 0 and 40 °C. For a given temperature, the values they give are somewhat different. No criterion helps to select between them the table that gives the most reliable values. The drawbacks of such a situation are reviewed and recommendations made to lessen their effects.</p>
    <p>Tables and graphs show the existing deviations, according to temperature, between the values of the various tables.</p>
    <p>New observations are needed to obtain values of the thermal expansion of water between 0 and 40 °C, having a relative accuracy of at least 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>
