abstract:
- content: "<p>Attention is drawn on the fact that several tables of the thermal expansion
    of water are available between 0 and 40 °C. For a given temperature, the values
    they give are somewhat different. No criterion helps to select between them the
    table that gives the most reliable values. The drawbacks of such a situation are
    reviewed and recommendations made to lessen their effects.</p><p>Tables and graphs
    show the existing deviations, according to temperature, between the values of
    the various tables.</p><p>New observations are needed to obtain values of the
    thermal expansion of water between 0 and 40 °C, having a relative accuracy of
    at least 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>"
