abstract:
- content: "<p>Following a brief review of the fundamental principles of acoustic
    thermometry in the range 2-20 K, its systematic errors are analysed in depth.
    It is argued that the ultrasonic technique suffers from certain sources of error
    which are virtually impossible to assess quantitatively except on the basis of
    certain conjectures about the excitation of the thermometer's resonant cavity.
    These are essentially guesses as to the way in which the driving ultrasonic transducer
    vibrates. Since these conjectures cannot be checked experimentally and since we
    can show that no other decisive information on the size of these errors can in
    principle be found in ultrasonic data, there must always remain a fundamental
    uncertainty in ultrasonic temperature measurement. However, the most plausible
    types of transducer behaviour would result in negligible errors in an ultrasonic
    instrument such as that used by Plumb and Cataland in their recent work provided
    that the resonant cavity is sufficiently well aligned. But, unfortunately, it
    has not yet proved possible to derive quantitative criteria for good end reflector
    alignment in such a device.</p><p>At sufficiently low frequencies none of these
    problems arise, but instead a correction has to be made for the effect of the
    acoustic boundary layer. It is argued that making this correction is a simpler
    matter than has usually been thought. Even in the absence of the information required
    to make a purely theoretical correction, a measured correction may be made relying
    only on a restricted set of theoretical assumptions which can easily be checked
    experimentally.</p><p>The relative merits of different types of cavity are also
    discussed together with the various techniques of using them.</p>"
