  content: "<p>Pulsed excitation of atomic and molecular beam devices with separated
    Ramsey-type interaction regions allows the observation of signals due to very
    narrow atomic velocity groups. The theoretical background of this method is discussed.
    Experimental operation of a near mono-velocity cesium beam tube is demonstrated.
    The velocity distribution of a commercial cesium beam tube is obtained using the
    pulse method. The normal Ramsey pattern of this beam tube is calculated from the
    velocity distribution and compared with the measured Ramsey pattern. The pulse
    method allows the direct determination of the cavity phase shift and of the second-order
    Doppler correction in beam devices. The pulse method thus shows promise for the
    evaluation of existing laboratory as well as commercial cesium beam tubes with
    respect to these effects.</p>"
