abstract:
- content: "<p>The design and construction of the new NRC 2.1 metre cesium beam frequency
    standard, Cs V, are described and preliminary performance data are given. The
    standard is equipped with a cesium oven and detector at each end, and experiments
    show that it functions satisfactorily for both beam directions, with negligible
    interaction between the adjacent oven and detector. Operating characteristics
    for both beam directions are discussed in detail, and systematic errors for both
    modes of operation are outlined. Preliminary estimates indicate that the accuracy
    is between 1 and 2 × 10<sup>-13</sup>. Comparisons with the NRC hydrogen masers
    show that a frequency stability of about 1 × 10<sup>-13</sup> is attainable within
    120 sec.</p>"
