abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes experiments carried out at the National Physical
    Laboratory using a hydrogen maser in comparison with a group of caesium standards
    which define the NPL time scale. A technique is developed for setting the maser
    and measuring its frequency with a reproducibility of 1 part in 10<sup>12</sup>.
    Three storage bulbs of different size coated with Teflon FEP-120 and three with
    Fluon GP1 are used to verify the linear relationship between maser frequency and
    inverse bulb diameter. The frequency at infinite bulb size is found by extrapolation,
    the uncertainty in this process being reduced by the use of the two coating materials.
    In terms of the international time unit, the unperturbed hydrogen hyperfine transition
    frequency is found to be f<sub>H</sub> = 1420405751.7662 ± 0.003 Hz. The effect
    of contaminating a normally coated bulb with unsintered coating material is investigated.
    The temperature coefficient of the wall shift for the two materials is investigated
    over the range 11 to 75° C and it is found that zero wall shift is obtained at
    80° C for FEP-120 and at 126 °C for GP1. The results provide experimental verification
    of the 2nd order Doppler shift within the limits of error of the measurements
    (± 1 part in 10<sup>12</sup>). Bulbs were measured at intervals over a period
    of 2 years and there is no evidence of frequency changes exceeding ± 1 part in
    10<sup>12</sup>. The difficulty of tuning the maser by changing the atomic flux
    is discussed, and an alternative method is described. It is concluded that the
    best way of operating the maser as a standard is by continuously resetting the
    cavity by a servo. A large bulb has a temperature coefficient less than 5 parts
    in 10<sup>14</sup>/°C and the maser could form a definitive standard with only
    simple control of the room temperature.</p>"
