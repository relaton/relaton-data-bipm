  content: "<p>A graphite cavity chamber for absolute exposure measurements of <sup>60</sup>Co
    gamma rays is presented. The chamber is designed to allow the determination of
    the exposure to rely as far as possible on a theoretical analysis previously given
    by Allisy. As an extension of this analysis, the problem of the influence of the
    cavity thickness is treated. The values to be used for the physical constants
    involved and the correction factors are discussed as well as the related uncertainties.</p>"
