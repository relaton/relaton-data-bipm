  content: <p>The influence of the geometry of the sample chamber on the melting behaviour
    of Ar samples is discussed. Melting curves of Ar samples doped with various small
    amounts of He, H<sub>2</sub>, Ne, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>
    and Kr impurities were determined relative to "pure" samples. It was found that
    He, H<sub>2</sub> and Ne did not alter the melting curve; N<sub>2</sub>, CO, O<sub>2</sub>
    and CH<sub>4</sub> lowered the liquidus point of Ar by 2.4, 2.4, 1.8 and 3.0 mK
    for 100 vppm of these impurities, respectively; Kr increased the scatter of points
    along the melting curve without noticeably altering the liquidus point. – Values
    for the triple point temperature and pressure and the boiling point were found
    to be 83.797<sub>6</sub> K and 516.730 ± 0.010 mmHg (68891.6 N/m<sup>2</sup>)
    and 87.294<sub>6</sub> K, respectively. – The vapour pressure of solid and liquid
    Ar can be described by ln <italic>P</italic> = <italic>A</italic><sub>S</sub>
    + (<italic>B</italic><sub>S</sub>/<italic>T</italic>) and ln <italic>P</italic>
    = <italic>A</italic><sub>L</sub> + (<italic>B</italic><sub>L</sub>/<italic>T</italic>)
    + <italic>C</italic><sub>L</sub><italic>T</italic> for 81 K ≲ <italic>T</italic>
    ≲ 83.8 K and 83.8 K ≲ <italic>T</italic> ≲ 87.3 K respectively. Numerical values
    of these constants are compared with some previous determinations.  Latent heats
    of sublimation, vaporization and fusion are calculated to be 7751.6, 6562.0 and
    1189.6 joules/mole respectively.</p>
