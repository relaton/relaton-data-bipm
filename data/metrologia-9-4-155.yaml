abstract:
- content: "<p>This paper describes in detail the procedures, methods and measurements
    used to establish a new definition of the U.S. legal volt via the ac Josephson
    effect. This new definition has been made possible by the use of thin film tunnel
    junctions (capable of producing 10 mV outputs) and high accuracy voltage comparators.
    The Josephson junction is used as a precise frequency-to-voltage converter with
    a conversion factor equal to 2e/h. A series of measurements of 2e/h has been carried
    out at NBS referenced to the as-maintained unit of emf based on a large group
    of standard cells. Measurements made at regular intervals over a one year period
    (1971 to 1972) indicate that the mean emf of this group of standard cells has
    decreased about 4 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>. Primarily to remove the effects of
    this drift, on July 1, 1972 a new as-maintained unit was defined by choosing a
    value of 2e/h consistent with the existing unit of emf. The adopted value of 2e/h
    is 483593.420 GHz/V<sub>NBS</sub>. The precision (one standard deviation) with
    which the new unit of emf can be maintained with the present techniques and apparatus
    is about 2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. The accuracy of the present system is estimated
    to be 4 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>. Comparisons of 2e/h systems at different national
    laboratories have been limited by uncertainties associated with the physical transfer
    of standard cells. In order to determine the relative agreement of the various
    2e/h systems with precision better than 1 or 2 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>, it appears
    desirable to compare 2e/h systems directly by transporting one of them.</p>"
