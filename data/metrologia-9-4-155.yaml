  content: "<p>This paper describes in detail the procedures, methods and measurements
    used to establish a new definition of the U.S. legal volt via the ac Josephson
    effect. This new definition has been made possible by the use of thin film tunnel
    junctions (capable of producing 10 mV outputs) and high accuracy voltage comparators.
    The Josephson junction is used as a precise frequency-to-voltage converter with
    a conversion factor equal to 2<italic>e/h</italic>. A series of measurements of
    2<italic>e/h</italic> has been carried out at NBS referenced to the as-maintained
    unit of emf based on a large group of standard cells. Measurements made at regular
    intervals over a one year period (1971 to 1972) indicate that the mean emf of
    this group of standard cells has decreased about 4 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>. Primarily
    to remove the effects of this drift, on July 1, 1972 a new as-maintained unit
    was defined by choosing a value of 2<italic>e/h</italic> consistent with the existing
    unit of emf. The adopted value of 2<italic>e/h</italic> is 483593.420 GHz/V<sub>NBS</sub>.
    The precision (one standard deviation) with which the new unit of emf can be maintained
    with the present techniques and apparatus is about 2 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.
    The accuracy of the present system is estimated to be 4 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>.
    Comparisons of 2<italic>e/h</italic> systems at different national laboratories
    have been limited by uncertainties associated with the physical transfer of standard
    cells. In order to determine the relative agreement of the various 2<italic>e/h</italic>
    systems with precision better than 1 or 2 parts in 10<sup>7</sup>, it appears
    desirable to compare 2<italic>e/h</italic> systems directly by transporting one
    of them.</p>"
