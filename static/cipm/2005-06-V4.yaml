abstract:
  - content: This document is based on a report, originally submitted to and agreed by, the CIPM in October 2004. It clarifies and interprets those original clauses in the CIPM MRA which require updating or interpreting in the light of experience and of developments since the CIPM MRA was originally signed. It does not replace the original CIPM MRA and should be read in conjunction with it. Page references are to the English version.
